 of these investments were made to counterparties or, if applicable, guaranteed by entities rated below single-A or the equivalent. 
 
 Securities purchased under agreements to resell are short-term and are structured such that they are evaluated daily to determine if the market value of the underlying securities decreases below the market value required as collateral (i.e. subject to collateral maintenance provisions). If so, the counterparty must place an amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash sufficient to comply with collateral maintenance provisions, generally by the next business day. Based upon the collateral held as security and collateral maintenance provisions with our counterparties, we determined that allowance for credit losses was needed for our securities purchased under agreements to resell at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Federal funds sold are unsecured loans that are transacted on an overnight term or short-term basis. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) regulations include a limit on the amount of unsecured credit we may extend to a counterparty. All investments in interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, have been repaid according to the contractual terms. allowance for credit losses was recorded for these assets at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Debt Securities 
 
 We invest in debt securities, which are classified as either trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. We are prohibited by FHFA regulations from investing in certain higher-risk securities, such as equity securities and debt instruments that are not investment quality, other than certain investments targeted at low-income persons or communities. We are not required to divest instruments that experience credit deterioration after their purchase.

 We offer advances to members and eligible nonmembers that provide the borrower the right, based upon predetermined option exercise dates, to repay the advance prior to maturity without incurring prepayment or termination fees (callable advances). We also offer certain floating-rate advances that may be contractually prepaid by the borrower on a floating-rate reset date without incurring prepayment or termination fees. Other advances may only be prepaid by paying a fee (prepayment fee) that makes us financially indifferent to the prepayment of the advance.

 Credit Risk Exposure and Security Terms. Our advances are primarily made to our members, including commercial banks, insurance companies, savings institutions, and credit unions. We manage our credit exposure to secured member credit products through an integrated approach that generally includes credit limits for borrowers based on ongoing reviews of each borrower's financial condition, the amount and value of available collateral, and collateral and lending policies that are intended to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers' needs for a reliable source of funding. For additional information on credit risk exposure and security terms see Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Advances in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 The Bank s decision to lend is based principally on our analysis of each borrower s financial condition and outlook, though we consider the types and level of collateral as additional factors. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had rights to collateral, on a borrower-by-borrower basis, with an estimated value greater than our outstanding extensions of credit.

of our advances were past due, on nonaccrual status, or considered impaired. In addition, there were modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties related to advances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Based upon the collateral held as security, our credit extension and collateral policies, management's credit analysis, and the repayment history on advances, we have t recorded any allowance for credit losses on our advances at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 Credit-Enhancements. Our allowance for credit losses factors in the credit-enhancements associated with conventional mortgage loans under the MPF program. These credit-enhancements apply after the homeowner's equity is exhausted and can include primary and/or supplemental mortgage insurance or other kinds of credit-enhancement. The credit risk analysis of our conventional loans is performed at the individual master commitment level to determine the credit-enhancements available to recover losses on loans under each individual master commitment. For additional information on credit enhancements see Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio Credit-Enhancements in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Payment Status of Mortgage Loans. Payment status is a key credit quality indicator for conventional mortgage loans and allows us to monitor borrower performance. A past due loan is one for which the borrower has failed to make a full payment of principal and interest within 30 days of its due date. Other delinquency statistics include nonaccrual loans and loans in process of foreclosure. Tables 4.3 and 4.4 present the payment status for conventional mortgage loans and other delinquency statistics for all mortgage loans at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

 Government Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio. We invest in government mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties. Government mortgage loans are mortgage loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (the FHA), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA), the Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (RHS), or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
 
 The servicer provides and maintains insurance or a guarantee from the applicable government agency. The servicer is responsible for compliance with all government agency requirements and for obtaining the benefit of the applicable insurance or guaranty with respect to defaulted government-guaranteed mortgage loans. Any losses incurred on these loans that are not recovered from the insurer or guarantor are absorbed by the related servicer. Therefore, we only have credit risk for these loans if the servicer fails to pay for losses not covered by insurance or guarantees, but in such instances, we will have recourse against the servicer for such failure. Due to government guarantees or insurance on our government loans, there is allowance for credit losses for the government mortgage loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Additionally, government mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status due to the government guarantee or insurance on these loans and the contractual obligation of the loan servicers to repurchase their related loans when certain criteria are met.

Cash paid or received for cleared derivatives variation margin is included on the statement of cash flows in either net change in derivatives and hedging activities as an operating activity or net payments on derivatives with a financing element as a financing activity. The table below shows the impact of variation margin for cleared derivatives on the statement of cash flows: Financing activity - net receipts on derivatives with a financing element Total variation margin (paid) received on cleared derivatives )

 Cleared Derivatives. For cleared derivatives, the DCO is our counterparty. The DCO notifies the clearing member of the required initial and variation margin and our agent (clearing member) in turn notifies us. At both DCOs, posted initial margin is considered collateral. We post initial margin and exchange variation margin through a clearing member of the DCO which clears our trades, acts as our agent to the DCO, and guarantees our performance to the DCO, subject to the terms of relevant agreements. These arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event that one of our clearing members or one of the DCOs fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because the DCO, which is fully secured at all times through margin received from its clearing members, is substituted for the credit risk exposure of individual counterparties in uncleared derivatives, and collateral is posted at least once daily for changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives through a clearing member. 
 
 For cleared derivatives, the DCO determines initial margin requirements. Our clearing members, which are U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission-registered futures commission merchants, may require us to post margin in excess of DCO requirements based on our credit or other considerations, including but not limited to, credit rating downgrades. 
 
 Offsetting of Certain Derivatives. We present derivatives, any related cash collateral received or pledged, and associated accrued interest, on a net basis by counterparty. 
 
 We have analyzed the rights, rules, and regulations governing our cleared and uncleared derivatives and determined that those rights, rules, and regulations should result in a net claim with each of our counterparties (which, in the context of cleared derivatives is through each of our clearing members with the related DCO) upon an event of default of our counterparty (solely in the case of uncleared derivatives) or the bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar proceeding involving our counterparty (and/or one of our clearing members, in the case of cleared derivatives). For this purpose, "net claim" generally means a single net amount reflecting the aggregation of all amounts owed by us to the relevant counterparty and payable to us from the relevant counterparty.

 We are a cooperative whose members own most of our capital stock. Former members, including certain nonmembers that own our capital stock as a result of merger or acquisition, relocation, or involuntary termination of membership, own the remaining capital stock to support business transactions still carried on our statement of condition or, for a small amount of capital stock held by former members, until the five-year redemption period applicable to their membership stock is complete. Shares of capital stock cannot be purchased or sold except between us and our members at per share par value. Each member is required to purchase Class B stock equal to percent of the value of the member's total assets measured as of December 31 of the preceding year, subject to a current minimum balance of thousand and a current maximum balance of million (the membership stock investment requirement), and percent for overnight advances, percent for all other advances, percent for outstanding standby letters of credit, and percent of the par value of certain mortgage loans we purchased through the MPF program (collectively, the activity-based stock-investment requirement). The sum of the membership stock investment requirement and the activity-based stock investment requirement, rounded up to the nearest whole share, represents the total stock investment requirement.

 Based on this evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, and through the filing of this report, we do not believe it is likely that we will be required to repay the principal or interest on any CO on behalf of another FHLBank. 
 
 We have considered applicable FASB guidance and determined it is not necessary to recognize a liability for the fair value of our joint and several liability for all of the COs. The joint and several obligation is mandated by the FHLBank Act, as implemented by FHFA regulations, and is not the result of an arms-length transaction among the FHLBanks. The FHLBanks have no control over the amount of the guaranty or the determination of how each FHLBank would perform under the joint and several obligation. Because the FHLBanks are subject to the authority of the FHFA as it relates to decisions involving the allocation of the joint and several liability for the FHLBanks' COs, the FHLBanks' joint and several obligation is excluded from the initial recognition and measurement provisions. Accordingly, we have not recognized a liability for our joint and several obligation related to other FHLBanks' COs at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The par amounts of other FHLBanks' outstanding COs for which we are jointly and severally liable totaled trillion at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. See Note 7 Consolidated Obligations for additional information.

 Standby Letters of Credit . At September 30, 2024, the outstanding standby letters of credit issued expire no later than 2039. Currently, we offer new standby letters of credit with terms typically up to , while terms greater than 10 years may be available on an exception basis.

We would record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 60.4 million, compared with net income of 70.1 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in net interest income after reduction of credit losses of 14.3 million, offset by an increase in other income of 3.4 million. 
 
 Net interest income after provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 89.8 million, compared with 104.1 million for the same period in 2023. The 14.3 million decrease in net interest income after provision for credit losses was primarily driven by a 13.5 million increase in mortgage backed security net amortization, and a 9.4 million unfavorable variance in net unrealized gains and losses on fair value hedge ineffectiveness, both attributable to a decrease in intermediate- and long-term interest rates during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to an increase in intermediate- and long-term interest rates during the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income after provision for credit losses was partially offset by increases of 3.4 billion, 2.5 billion, and 572.9 million in our average advances, MBS, and mortgage loan portfolios, respectively. 
 
 Total assets increased 5.3 billion to 72.4 billion over the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, investment securities and short-term money-market investments totaled 26.1 billion, an increase of 5.0 billion from December 31, 2023, comprised primarily of a 3.4 billion increase in short-term investments and a 1.4 billion increase in MBS. Mortgage loans totaled 3.5 billion, an increase of 484.2 million from December 31, 2023, and advances totaled 42.0 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 48.2 million from December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our retained earnings grew to 1.9 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 82.8 million from December 31, 2023, equaling 2.6 percent of total assets at September 30, 2024. We continue to satisfy all regulatory capital requirements as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 On October 25, 2024, our board of directors declared a cash dividend that was equivalent to an annual yield of 8.36 percent on the average daily balance of capital stock outstanding during the third quarter of 2024. The yield is equivalent to the approximate daily average of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for the third quarter of 2024 plus 300 basis points. 
 
 Our overall results of operations are influenced by the economy, interest rates, members demand for liquidity, and our ability to maintain sufficient access to funding at relatively favorable costs.

Table of Contents 

 Generally, investor demand for high credit quality, fixed-income investments, including COs, continued to be strong relative to other investments. Yield spreads on CO debt relative to benchmark yields for comparable debt remained relatively stable during the period covered by this report. Our flexibility in utilizing various funding tools, in combination with a diverse investor base and our status as a government-sponsored enterprise, have helped provide reliable market access and demand for COs throughout fluctuating market environments and regulatory changes affecting dealers of and investors in COs. The Bank has continued to meet all funding needs during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net Interest Margin and Spread 
 
 Net interest spread was 0.19 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of eight basis points from the same period in 2023, and net interest margin was 0.52 percent, a decrease of 13 basis points from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest spread and margin was primarily attributable to the substantial decrease in intermediate- and long-term interest rates resulting in an increase of net MBS premium amortization and an unfavorable variance in net unrealized gains and losses on fair value hedge ineffectiveness, as described above. 
 
 Housing and Community Investment Programs 
 
 We are required to annually set aside a portion of our earnings for our Affordable Housing Program. These funds assist members serving very low-, low-, and moderate-income households and support community economic development. The Bank's net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted in an accrual of 6.7 million and 23.2 million, respectively, to the AHP pool of funds that will be available to members in 2025. 
 
 We have certain discretionary subsidized advance and grant programs for our members, including our Jobs for New England (JNE), Housing Our Workforce (HOW), and Lift Up Homeownership programs. For additional information on these three programs, see Item 1 Business Targeted Housing and Community Investment Programs in the 2023 Annual Report. Additionally, in 2024, the Bank launched two new pilot programs: the MPF Permanent Rate Buydown product, which enables our participating financial institutions that utilize the MPF Program to reduce interest rates paid by income-eligible borrowers by up to 2 percentage points, and the CDFI Advance, which is a subsidized advance program for our members targeting certified, non-depository community development financial institutions (CDFIs) to support the development of affordable housing, job creation/small business growth, and the expansion of community facilities in distressed communities throughout New England.

 Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 
 Legislation has been proposed or enacted, and the FHFA and others with authority over the economy, our industry, and our business activities have taken action during 2024 as described in Legislative and Regulatory Developments . Such developments affect the way we conduct business and could impact how we satisfy our mission as well as the value of membership in the Bank. 

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
 
 Economic Environment 
 37 

Table of Contents 

Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter of 2024. This expansion was driven mainly by consumer spending, exports, and federal government spending. The increase in consumer spending reflected spending increases on both services and goods. 
 
 Employment remained steady with job gains averaging 148,000 per month in the third quarter of 2024. In October 2024, employment increased by 12,000 and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent. The unemployment rate for the New England region in September 2024 was 3.5 percent, ranging from 2.2 percent in Vermont to 4.6 percent in Rhode Island. 
 
 In September 2024, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2 percent from the preceding month, representing a year-over- year increase of 2.4 percent. CPI was driven mainly by the cost of food and shelter. The FHFA reported that housing prices rose 4.2 percent across the U.S. from August 2023 to August 2024. Over the same period, housing prices in New England rose 5.9 percent. 
 
 Interest-Rate Environment 
 
 On September 18, 2024, the FOMC lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to 475 and 500 basis points, and on November 7, 2024, lowered the target range for the federal funds by another 25 basis points to 450 and 475 basis points. The FOMC stated that in considering any additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The FOMC also stated that it would continue reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities, and is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its two percent objective. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, short-term rates remained elevated, consistent with the FOMC s target range for the federal funds rate. Long-term rates fluctuated, along with expectations regarding the timing and magnitude of potential rate cuts by the FOMC. At the end of September 2024, 2-, 5- and 10-year Treasury rates were lower than overnight and 3-month rates.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Third Quarter of 2024 Compared with the Third Quarter of 2023 
 
 Net income decreased 9.7 million to 60.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 70.1 million for the same period in 2023. The primary reasons for the decrease are discussed under Executive Summary . 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net income increased 2.6 million to 208.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 205.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase of 12.1 million in net interest income after provision for credit losses partially offset by an 7.3 million increase in expenses related to our discretionary housing and community investment programs, and a 3.5 million increase in compensation and benefits expense. 
 
 Net interest income after provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 307.7 million, compared with 295.6 million for 2023. The 12.1 million increase in net interest income after provision for credit losses was driven by an increase in average daily yields resulting from higher average short-term market interest rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding prior year period as well as increases of 2.1 billion and 476.3 million in our average mortgage-backed securities portfolio and average mortgage loan portfolio, respectively, moderated by a 2.6 billion decline in our average advances portfolio and a 1.4 billion decline in average short-term money-market investments. In addition, there was a 2.0 million unfavorable variance in net unrealized gains and losses on fair value hedge ineffectiveness attributable to a greater decrease in intermediate-term interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest spread was 0.25 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of two basis points from the same period in 2023, and net interest margin was 0.60 percent, an increase of three basis points from the same period in 2023. 
 
 Table 4 presents major categories of average balances, related interest income/expense, and average yields/rates for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is the interest earned on advances, mortgage loans, and investments less interest paid on COs, deposits, and other sources of funds.

 Rate and Volume Analysis 
 
 Changes in both average balances (volume) and interest rates influence changes in net interest income and net interest margin. Table 5 summarizes changes in interest income and interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Changes in interest income and interest expense that are not identifiable as either volume or rate-related, but equally attributable to both volume and rate changes, have been allocated to the volume and rate categories based upon the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes.

 Average Balance of Advances 
 
 The average balance of total advances decreased 2.6 billion, or 6.1 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023 during which depository members' demand for advances was elevated. This decrease in the average balance of advances was primarily concentrated in short-term fixed rate advances and variable-rate advances, partially offset by an increase in long-term fixed rate advances. We cannot predict future member demand for advances. 
 
 Average Balance of Investments 
 
 Average short-term money-market investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, federal funds sold, and loans to other FHLBanks, decreased 1.4 billion, or 15.0 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, as liquidity needs were greater in 2023 compared to 2024 due to increased advances borrowing activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield earned on short-term money-market investments is highly correlated to short-term market interest rates. As a result of increases during 2023 in the FOMC's target range for the federal funds rate, average yields on overnight federal funds sold increased from 4.97 percent during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.38 percent during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while average yields on securities purchased under agreements to resell increased from 4.97 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.39 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These investments are used for liquidity management. 
 
 Average investment-securities balances increased 1.9 billion, or 13.1 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily the result of a 2.1 billion increase in average MBS. 
 
 Average Balance of COs 
 
 Average CO balances decreased 1.4 billion, or 2.2 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, resulting from our decreased funding needs principally due to the decrease in our average advances balances. This decrease consisted of a 5.4 billion decline in CO discount notes partially offset by a 4.0 billion increase in CO bonds. 
 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 The average balance of CO discount notes represented approximately 31.6 percent of total average COs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 39.4 percent of total average COs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of CO bonds represented 68.4 percent and 60.6 percent of total average COs outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Impact of Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
 
 Net interest income includes interest accrued on interest-rate-exchange agreements that are associated with advances, investments, and debt instruments that qualify for hedge accounting. The fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items designated in fair-value hedge relationships are also recognized as interest income or interest expense. We enter into derivatives to manage the interest-rate-risk exposures inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and liabilities and to achieve our risk-management objectives. We generally use derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as interest-rate risk-management tools. These derivatives serve to stabilize net income when interest rates fluctuate by better matching the rate repricing characteristics of financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the impact of derivatives on net interest income and net interest margin, as well as other income, should be viewed in the overall context of our risk-management strategy. 
 
 Table 6 provides a summary of the impact of derivatives and hedging activities on our earnings.

 Advances Credit Risk 
 
 We manage credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of our borrowers and by holding sufficient collateral to protect the Bank from credit losses. The Bank has an internal credit rating methodology that estimates each borrower s credit risk utilizing call report data and other quantitative factors as well as qualitative considerations including, but not limited to, regulatory examination reports. Based on its rating, we assign each member and non-member housing associate to a credit category (one through four) to allow the Bank to leverage risk mitigation strategies across groups of similarly rated members. Each credit category reflects increasing limitations on borrowing capacity and terms to maturity, as well as our increasing level of control over the collateral pledged by the borrower. 
 
 Credit category one (Credit Category-1), a borrower is generally in a satisfactory financial condition. 
 Credit category two (Credit Category-2), a borrower shows financial weakness or weakening financial trends. 
 Credit category three (Credit Category-3), a borrower demonstrates financial weaknesses that present an elevated level of concern. 
 Credit category four (Credit Category-4), a borrower shows significant financial weaknesses and an increased likelihood of failure over the next 12 months.

Table of Contents 

 The Bank may impose different borrowing capacity limitations or collateral pledging requirements on a borrower if the Bank determines that doing so mitigates risks to the Bank and/or the borrower.

Other than housing associates, nonmember borrowers may not request new advances and are not permitted to extend or renew any advances they have assumed. 
 
 All pledged collateral is subject to collateral discounts, or haircuts, to the market value or par value, as applicable, based on our opinion of the risk such collateral presents. We are prohibited by Section 10(a) of the FHLBank Act from making advances without sufficient collateral. We have never experienced a credit loss on an advance. 
 
 The Bank may adjust the credit category of a member from time to time based on the financial reviews and other information pertinent to that member. 
 
 We have not recorded any allowance for credit losses on advances as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, for the reasons discussed in Part 1 - Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Note 3 Advances .

 Investments 
 
 At September 30, 2024, investment securities and short-term money-market instruments totaled 26.1 billion, an increase of 5.0 billion from 21.2 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Short-term money-market investments increased 3.4 billion to 9.1 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023. The increase was attributable to increases of 2.1 billion in federal funds sold, 1.2 billion in securities purchased under agreements to resell, and 166.0 million in interest bearing deposits. 
 
 Investment securities increased 1.6 billion to 17.0 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 15.4 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the 1.2 billion increase in the par value of MBS. 
 
 Investments Credit Risk 
 
 We are subject to credit risk on unsecured investments consisting primarily of short-term (meaning one year or less to maturity) money-market instruments issued by high-quality financial institutions and long-term (original maturity greater than one year) debentures issued or guaranteed by U.S. agencies, U.S government-owned corporations, GSEs, and supranational institutions. 
 
 We place short-term funds with large, high-quality financial institutions that must be rated in at least the third-highest internal rating category on a rating scale of FHFA1 through FHFA7, reflecting progressively lower credit quality. The internal rating categories of FHFA1 through FHFA4 are considered to be investment quality. As of September 30, 2024, all of these placements either expired within one day or were payable upon demand. See Part 1 Item 1 Business Business Lines Investments in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information. 
 
 In addition to these unsecured investments, we also make secured investments in the form of securities purchased under agreements to resell secured by U.S. Treasury, U.S. government guaranteed, or agency obligations, with current terms to maturity up to 95 days and in MBS and HFA securities that are directly or indirectly supported by underlying mortgage loans.

 We actively monitor our investment credit exposures and the credit quality of our counterparties, including assessments of each counterparty's financial performance, capital adequacy, sovereign support, and collateral quality and performance, as well as related market signals such as equity prices and credit default swap spreads. We may reduce or suspend credit limits and/or seek to reduce existing exposures, as appropriate, as a result of these monitoring activities.

 (1) The counterparty NRSRO rating is used for money-market instruments. Counterparty ratings are obtained from Moody's, Fitch, Inc. (Fitch), and S P and are each as of September 30, 2024. If there is a split rating, the lowest rating is used. In certain instances where a counterparty is unrated, the Bank may assign a deemed rating to the counterparty and that deemed rating is used. 
 (2) The issue rating is used for investment securities. Issue ratings are obtained from Moody s, Fitch, and S P. If there is a split rating, the lowest rating is used. 
 
 FHFA regulations include limits on the amount of unsecured credit we may extend to a counterparty or to a group of affiliated counterparties based on a percentage of regulatory capital and an internal credit rating determined by each FHLBank. See Part 1 Item 1 Business Business Lines Investments in the 2023 Annual Report for additional information. Under these regulations, the level of regulatory capital is determined as the lesser of our total regulatory capital or the regulatory capital of the counterparty. The applicable regulatory capital is then multiplied by a specified percentage for each counterparty, the product of which is the maximum amount of unsecured credit exposure we may extend to that counterparty. The percentage that 
 49

 we may offer for extensions of unsecured credit other than overnight sales of federal funds ranges from one to 15 percent based on the counterparty's credit rating. Extensions of unsecured credit for overnight sales of federal funds range from one to 30 percent based on the counterparty s credit rating. From time to time, we may establish internal credit limits lower than permitted by regulation for individual counterparties.

Mortgage Loans 
 
 We invest in mortgages through the MPF program. The MPF program is further described under Mortgage Loans Credit Risk and in Part I Item 1 Business Business Lines Mortgage Loan Finance in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our mortgage loan investment portfolio totaled 3.5 billion, an increase of 484.2 million from December 31, 2023. This increase is the result of an increase in mortgage loan purchase volume during 2024. We expect continued competition from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as from private mortgage loan acquirers, for loan investment opportunities. 
 
 Mortgage Loans Credit Risk 
 
 We are subject to credit risk from the mortgage loans in which we invest due to our exposure to the credit risk of the underlying borrowers and the credit risk of the participating financial institutions when the participating financial institutions retain credit-enhancement and/or servicing obligations. For additional information on the credit risks arising from our participation in the MPF program, see Part II Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Mortgage Loans Mortgage Loans Credit Risk in the 2023 Annual Report. For information on the credit performance of our mortgage loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024, see Item I Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements Note 4 Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio in this report. 
 
 Although our mortgage loan portfolio includes loans throughout the U.S., concentrations of 5 percent or greater of the par value of our conventional mortgage loan portfolio are shown in Table 12.

 We place conventional mortgage loans on nonaccrual status when the collection of interest or principal is doubtful or contractual principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. Accrued interest on nonaccrual loans is excluded from interest income. We monitor the delinquency levels of the mortgage loan portfolio on a monthly basis.

 Derivative Instruments 
 
 All derivatives are recorded on the statement of condition at fair value and classified as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Bilateral and cleared derivatives outstanding are classified as assets or liabilities according to the net fair value of derivatives aggregated by each counterparty. Derivative assets' net fair value, net of cash collateral and accrued interest, totaled 355.4 million and 383.1 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Derivative liabilities' net fair value, net of cash collateral and accrued interest, totaled 6.8 million and 3.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The following table presents a summary of the notional amounts and estimated fair values of our outstanding derivatives, excluding accrued interest, and related hedged item by product and type of accounting treatment as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The notional amount represents the hypothetical principal basis used to determine periodic interest payments received and paid. However, the notional amount does not represent an actual amount exchanged or our overall exposure to credit and market risk.

 Derivative Instruments Credit Risk. We are subject to credit risk on derivatives. This risk arises from the risk of counterparty default on the derivative contract. The amount of unsecured credit exposure to derivative counterparty default is the amount by which the replacement cost of the defaulted derivative contract exceeds the value of any collateral held by us (if the counterparty is the net obligor on the derivative contract) or is exceeded by the value of collateral pledged by us to counterparties (if we are the net obligor on the derivative contract). We accept cash and securities collateral in accordance with the terms of the applicable master netting agreement for uncleared derivatives (principal-to-principal derivatives that are not centrally cleared) from counterparties with whom we are in a current positive fair-value position. We pledge cash and securities collateral in accordance with the terms of the applicable master netting agreement for uncleared derivatives to counterparties with whom we are in a current negative fair-value position. We currently pledge only cash collateral, including initial and variation margin, for cleared derivatives, but may also pledge securities for initial margin as allowed by the applicable DCO and clearing member. 
 
 Our daily average aggregate notional amount for uncleared derivatives transactions between June 2023 and August 2023 exceeded 8 billion and, as a result, we remained subject to two-way initial margin obligations as required by the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. For uncleared derivatives transactions executed on or after September 1, 2022, a party whose initial margin requirement exceeds a specified threshold (which may not exceed 50 million) would be required to 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 deliver collateral in the amount by which the initial margin requirement exceeds such specified threshold. Initial margin is required to be held at a third-party custodian for the benefit of the secured party, which can only assert ownership of such collateral upon the occurrence of certain events, which may include an event of default due to bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceeding. As of September 30, 2024, all initial margin requirements owed to our uncleared derivative counterparties by us or owed to us by our uncleared derivative counterparties were less than specified delivery thresholds. 
 
 From time to time, due to timing differences or derivatives-valuation differences, between our calculated derivatives values and those of our counterparties, and to the contractual haircuts applied to securities, we receive from (or pledge to) our counterparties cash or securities collateral whose fair value is less (or more) than the current net positive (or net negative) fair-value of derivatives positions outstanding with them.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Our financial structure is designed to enable us to expand and contract our assets, liabilities, and capital in response to changes in membership composition and member credit needs. Our primary source of liquidity is our access to the capital markets through CO issuance, which is described in Part I Item 1 Business Consolidated Obligations of the 2023 Annual Report. Outstanding COs and the condition of the market for COs are discussed below under Debt Financing Consolidated Obligations. Our equity capital resources are governed by our capital plan, certain portions of which are described under Capital below as well as by applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 We are required to maintain liquidity in accordance with the FHLBank Act, FHFA regulations and guidance, and policies established by our management and board of directors. We seek to be in a position to meet the credit and liquidity needs of our members and all current and future financial commitments by managing liquidity positions to maintain stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds while taking into account market conditions, member demand, and the maturity profile of our assets and liabilities. 
 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 We are unable to predict future trends in member credit needs because they are driven by complex interactions among several factors, including, but not limited to, increases and decreases in members assets and deposits, and the attractiveness of advances compared to other sources of wholesale funding. We regularly monitor current trends and anticipate future debt issuance needs and maintain a portfolio of highly liquid assets to be prepared to fund member credit needs and investment opportunities. We are generally able to expand our CO debt issuance in response to members' increased need for advances and to increase our acquisitions of mortgage loans. Alternatively, in response to reduced member credit needs, we may shrink our balance sheet by allowing our COs to mature without replacement, transferring debt to another FHLBank, repurchasing and retiring outstanding COs, or redeeming callable COs on eligible redemption dates. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are proceeds from the issuance of COs and advance repayments, and maturing short-term investments, as well as cash and investment holdings that are primarily high-quality, short- and intermediate-term financial instruments that can be sold or pledged as collateral under a repurchase agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we maintained continuous access to funding and adapted our debt issuance to meet the needs of our members. 
 
 Secondary sources of liquidity include payments collected on mortgage loans, proceeds from the issuance of capital stock, and member deposits. In addition, under the FHLBank Act, the U.S. Treasury may purchase up to 4 billion of FHLBank COs. The terms, conditions, and interest rates in such a purchase would be determined by the U.S. Treasury. This authority may be exercised at the discretion of the U.S. Treasury with the agreement of the FHFA only if alternative means cannot be effectively employed to permit members of the FHLBanks to continue to supply reasonable amounts of funds to the mortgage market, and the ability to supply such funds is substantially impaired because of monetary stringency and high interest rates. There were no such purchases by the U.S. Treasury during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our uses of liquidity are advance originations and consolidated obligation principal and interest payments. Other uses of liquidity are mortgage loan and investment purchases, dividend payments, general operating expenses, and other contractually obligated payments. We also maintain liquidity to redeem or repurchase excess capital stock, through our daily excess stock repurchases, upon the request of a member or as required under our capital plan. 
 
 For information and discussion of our guarantees and other commitments we may have, see Part 1 Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies . For further information and discussion of the joint and several liability for FHLBank COs, see below Debt Financing Consolidated Obligations. 
 
 Internal Liquidity Sources / Liquidity Management 
 
 We have developed a methodology and policies by which we measure and manage the Bank s short-term liquidity needs based on projected net cash flow and contingent obligations. 
 
 Projected Net Cash Flow. We define projected net cash flow as projected sources of funds less projected uses of funds based on contractual maturities or expected option exercise periods, and settlement of committed assets and liabilities, as applicable. For mortgage-related cash flows and callable debt, we incorporate projected prepayments and call exercise. 
 
 Liquidity Management Action Trigger. We maintain a liquidity management action trigger pertaining to projected net cash flow: if projected net cash flow falls below zero on or before the 21 st day following the measurement date, then management of the Bank is notified and determines whether any corrective action is necessary. We did not breach this threshold at any time during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Table 16 below shows this calculation as of September 30, 2024.

 Base Case Liquidity Requirement. The Bank is subject to FHFA guidance on liquidity, including Advisory Bulletin 2018-07 (Liquidity Guidance AB), which communicates the FHFA s expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to enable us to provide advances and fund standby letters of credit for members for a specified time without access to the capital markets or other unsecured funding sources. 
 
 The Liquidity Guidance AB provides guidance on the level of on-balance sheet liquid assets related to base case liquidity. As part of the base case liquidity measure, the guidance also includes a separate provision covering off-balance sheet commitments from standby letters of credit. In addition, the Liquidity Guidance AB provides guidance related to asset/liability maturity funding gap limits. 
 
 Under the Liquidity Guidance AB, FHLBanks are required to maintain sufficient liquid assets to achieve positive projected net cash flow while rolling over maturing advances to all members and assuming no access to capital markets for a period of time between 10 and 30 calendar days, with a specific measurement period set forth in a supervisory letter. The Liquidity Guidance AB also sets forth the initial cash flow assumptions and formula to calculate base case liquidity. With respect to standby letters of credit, the guidance states that FHLBanks should maintain a liquidity reserve of between one percent and 20 percent of its outstanding standby letters of credit commitments, as specified in a supervisory letter. 
 
 We were in compliance with the Base Case Liquidity Requirement at all times during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Balance Sheet Funding Gap Policy. We may use a portion of the short-term COs issued to fund assets with longer terms, including longer-term floating-rate assets. Funding longer-term floating-rate assets with shorter-term liabilities generally does not expose us to significant interest-rate risk because the interest rates on both the floating-rate assets and liabilities typically reset similarly (either through rate resets or re-issuance of the obligations). However, deviations in the cost of our short-term liabilities relative to resetting assets can cause fluctuations in our net interest margin. 
 
 Additionally, the Bank is exposed to refinancing risk since, over certain time horizons, it has more liabilities than assets maturing. In order to manage the Bank s refinancing risk, we maintain a policy that limits the potential difference between the amount of financial assets and the amount of financial liabilities expected to mature within three-month and one-year time 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 horizons inclusive of projected mortgage-related prepayment activity. We measure this difference, or gap, as a percentage of total assets over three-month and one-year time horizons. In conformity with the provisions of the Liquidity Guidance AB, the Bank has instituted a limit and management action trigger framework around these metrics as follows: 
 
 Table 17 - Funding Gap Metric 
 Funding Gap Metric (1) 
 Limit Management Action Trigger Three-Month Average September 30, 2024 Three-Month Average December 31, 2023 3-month Funding Gap 15 13 6.3 3.8 1-year Funding Gap 30 25 13.0 17.5 _______________________ 
 (1) The funding gap metric is a positive value when maturing liabilities exceed maturing assets, as defined, within the given period. Compliance with Limits and Management Action Triggers are evaluated against the rolling three-month average of the month-end funding gaps. 
 
 External Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Amended and Restated FHLBanks P I Funding Contingency Plan Agreement. We have a source of emergency external liquidity through the Amended and Restated FHLBanks P I Funding Contingency Plan Agreement. Under the terms of that agreement, in the event we do not fund principal and interest payments due with respect to any CO for which issuance proceeds were allocated to us within deadlines established in the agreement, the other FHLBanks will be obligated to fund any shortfall to the extent that any of the other FHLBanks has a net positive settlement balance (that is, the amount by which end-of-day proceeds received by such FHLBank from the sale of COs exceeds payments by such FHLBank on COs on the same day) in its account with the Office of Finance on the day the shortfall occurs. We would then be required to repay the funding to the other FHLBanks. We have never drawn funding under this agreement, nor have we ever been required to provide funding to another FHLBank under this agreement. 
 
 Debt Financing Consolidated Obligations 
 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, outstanding COs for which we are primarily liable, including both CO bonds and CO discount notes, totaled 67.3 billion and 62.2 billion, respectively. CO bonds outstanding for which we are primarily liable at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, include issued callable bonds totaling 19.3 billion and 22.2 billion, respectively. 
 
 CO discount notes comprised 22.2 percent and 35.3 percent of the outstanding COs for which we are primarily liable at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, but accounted for 68.5 percent and 81.2 percent of the proceeds from the issuance of such COs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Overall, we continued to experience strong demand for COs among investors. During the period covered by this report, the capital markets have supported our funding needs and we have been able to issue debt in the amounts and structures required to satisfy the demand for advances and meet our funding and risk-management needs. 
 
 The Federal Reserve has highlighted continued progress toward achieving its two percent inflation objective, noting that labor market conditions have generally eased and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. While inflation has made progress toward the FOMC s objectives, it remains somewhat elevated. As such, the FOMC lowered the target range of the federal funds rate by 0.50 percentage points in September 2024, and 0.25 percentage points in November 2024, to a range of 4.50 to 4.75 percent and will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities. These actions remain important factors that could continue to shape investor demand for debt, including COs. 
 
 Capital 
 
 Total capital at September 30, 2024, was 3.8 billion compared with 3.5 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The FHLBank Act and FHFA regulations specify that each FHLBank is required to satisfy certain minimum regulatory capital requirements. We were in compliance with these requirements at September 30, 2024, as discussed in Part 1 Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Note 9 Capital .

 Capital Rule 
 
 The FHFA's regulation on FHLBank capital classification and critical capital levels (the Capital Rule), among other things, establishes criteria for four capital classifications and corrective action requirements for FHLBanks that are classified in any classification other than adequately capitalized. The Capital Rule requires the Director of the FHFA to determine on no less than a quarterly basis the capital classification of each FHLBank. By letter dated September 26, 2024, the Director of the FHFA notified us that, based on financial information as of June 30, 2024, we met the definition of adequately capitalized under the Capital Rule. 
 
 Internal Capital Practices and Policies 
 
 We take steps we believe to be prudent beyond legal or regulatory requirements to ensure capital adequacy, reflected in our internal minimum capital requirement, which exceeds regulatory requirements, our minimum retained earnings management action trigger and limit, and limitations on our dividends. In the event that the board of directors deems capital to be deficient, the Bank has a number of options it can pursue, either individually or collectively, to address capital deficiencies and these include, but are not limited to: 
 
 Limiting or withholding dividends; 
 Limiting or precluding capital stock repurchases; 
 Increasing membership and/or activity-based stock requirements; and/or 
 Restricting risk taking as needed to restore compliance, such as by reducing assets or risk exposures. 
 
 Internal Minimum Capital Requirement in Excess of Regulatory Requirements 
 
 To provide protection for our capital base, we maintain an internal minimum capital requirement whereby the amount of paid-in capital stock and retained earnings (together, our actual regulatory capital) must be at least equal to the sum of 4 percent of our total assets plus an amount we measure as our risk exposure with 99 percent confidence using our economic capital model (together, our internal minimum capital requirement). As of September 30, 2024, this internal minimum capital requirement equaled 3.6 billion, which was satisfied by our actual regulatory capital of 4.0 billion. 
 
 Minimum Retained Earnings 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024 we implemented a management action trigger and a limit for our minimum level of retained earnings, both of which are determined monthly using rolling three-month averages: 
 
 Management action trigger: retained earnings must be at least 4.5 percent of our total assets less outstanding capital stock plus the higher of (a) the risk-based capital requirement or (b) the economic capital requirement; and 
 Limit: retained earnings must be at least 4.0 percent of our total assets less outstanding capital stock plus the higher of (a) the risk-based capital requirement or (b) the economic capital requirement. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had total retained earnings of 1.9 billion, which exceeded both the management action trigger of 1.7 billion and the limit of 1.4 billion. This method for determining our minimum amount of retained earnings replaced our previous target of 700.0 million in July 2024. In the event that the Bank s balance of retained earnings is below the limit, dividends may not exceed 40 percent of the prior quarter s net income. 
 
 Repurchases of Excess Stock 
 
 We have the authority, but are not obliged, to repurchase excess stock, as discussed under Part I Item 1 Business Capital Resources Repurchase of Excess Stock in the 2023 Annual Report.

 To facilitate our ability to maintain a prudent level of capitalization and an efficient capital structure, while providing for an equitable allocation of excess stock ownership among members, we conduct daily repurchases of excess stock from any shareholder whose excess stock exceeds the lesser of 3 million or 3 percent of the shareholder s total stock investment requirement, subject to the minimum repurchase of 100,000. We plan to continue this practice, subject to regulatory requirements and our liquidity or capital management needs, although repurchase decisions remain at our sole discretion, and we retain authority to adjust our excess stock repurchase practices subject to notice requirements defined in our Capital Plan, or to suspend repurchases of excess stock from any shareholder or all shareholders without prior notice. 
 
 Restricted Retained Earnings and the Joint Capital Agreement 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our total required contribution to the restricted retained earnings account was 643.6 million compared with the current restricted retained earnings account balance of 492.8 million. 
 
 Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
 
 Our significant off-balance-sheet arrangements consist of the following: 
 
 commitments that obligate us for additional advances; 
 standby letters of credit; 
 commitments for unused lines-of-credit advances; and 
 unsettled COs. 
 
 Off-balance-sheet arrangements are more fully discussed in Part 1 Item 1 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies . 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. To understand the Bank's financial position and results of operations, it is important to understand the Bank's most significant accounting policies and the extent to which management uses judgment, estimates and assumptions in applying those policies. The Bank's critical accounting estimates include: 
 
 Estimation of Fair Values, for derivatives, hedged items in a fair-value hedge relationship, and available-for-sale investment securities; and 
 Amortization of Premiums and Accretion of Discounts Associated with Prepayable MBS. 
 
 Management considers these policies to be critical because they require us to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its judgment and estimates on current market conditions and industry practices, historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and/or conditions. The Audit Committee of our board of directors has reviewed these estimates. The assumptions involved in applying these policies are discussed in Part II Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, we have not made any significant changes to the estimates and assumptions used in applying our critical accounting policies and estimates from those used to prepare our audited financial statements. 

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 We summarize certain significant legislative and regulatory actions and related developments for the period covered by this report below. 
 
 FHFA s Review and Analysis of the FHLBank System. On November 7, 2023, the FHFA issued a written report titled FHLBank System at 100: Focusing on the Future, (System at 100 Report) presenting its review and analysis of the FHLBank System and the actions and recommendations it plans to pursue in service of its vision for the future of the FHLBank System. The report focused on four broad themes: (1) the mission of the FHLBank System; (2) the FHLBank System as a stable and reliable source of liquidity; (3) housing and community development; and (4) FHLBank System operational efficiency, structure, and governance. The FHFA has stated that it expects to continue a multi-year collaborative effort with the FHLBanks, their member institutions, and other stakeholders to address the recommended actions in the System at 100 Report and has stated that it can implement some of the recommendations from the report through ongoing supervision, guidance, or rulemaking, as well as through statutory changes by proposing specific requests for Congressional action. The FHFA made legislative recommendations for the FHLBank System in its 2023 Report to Congress issued on June 14, 2024, consistent with proposed plans and actions included in the System at 100 Report. Other significant recent regulatory actions for the FHLBanks are discussed in this section. 
 
 We continue to monitor the FHFA s efforts to implement the recommendations from the System at 100 Report, including proposed plans and actions, and we are unable to predict what actions will ultimately result, the timing or extent of any actions or changes, or the ultimate effect on us, our members, or the FHLBank System in the future. We plan to continue engaging with the FHFA and other stakeholders in an effort to ensure the FHLBank System remains well positioned to serve the Bank s members and their communities. For further discussion of the System at 100 Report, see, Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Legislative and Regulatory Developments in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank Member Credit Risk Management . On September 27, 2024, the FHFA issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the FHFA s expectations that an FHLBank s underwriting and credit decisions should reflect a member s financial condition and not rely solely on the collateral securing a member s credit obligations. The advisory bulletin provides guidance for the FHLBanks to implement policies for credit risk governance, member credit assessment and monitoring of credit conditions, among other considerations. It also provides guidance on the oversight of members in financial distress by recommending implementation of escalation policies, processes for coordination with members prudential regulators, and management policies addressing default, failure, and insolvency situations. While we are comparing this advisory bulletin against our current member credit risk management policies and procedures to assess the potential impact on our financial condition and operations, we do not expect that this guidance will impact our role as a reliable source of liquidity for our members. 
 
 Advisory Bulletin on Federal Home Loan Bank System Climate-Related Risk Management . On September 30, 2024, the FHFA issued an advisory bulletin setting forth the FHFA s expectation that each FHLBank should integrate climate-related risk management into its existing enterprise risk management framework over time. The advisory bulletin provides that an effective framework should address climate-related risk governance, such as selection of the related risk appetite and setting strategy and objectives, establishing and implementing plans to mitigate, monitor and report material exposures to such risks, and establishing roles and responsibilities for the board of directors and management. The advisory bulletin requires the FHLBanks to establish metrics that track exposure to climate-related risks and collect related data to quantify risk exposures, conduct climate-related scenario analyses, implement processes to report and communicate climate-related risks to internal stakeholders, and have a plan to respond to natural disasters and support climate resiliency. We are evaluating the potential impact of the advisory bulletin on the us and our operations, with some aspects of this advisory bulletin applying to the Office of Finance. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Unsecured Credit Limits for Federal Home Loan Banks. On October 3, 2024, the FHFA published a proposed rule with a comment deadline of December 2, 2024, to amend the FHFA s regulation on capital requirements (Capital Regulation) to modify unsecured credit limits for FHLBanks. The proposed rule would include interest bearing deposit accounts (IBDAs) in a category of authorized overnight investments that would be excluded from the general limit on unsecured credit to a single counterparty. IBDAs are non-maturity deposits in approved counterparties which may be used to manage liquidity. The proposed rule would, among other things, increase the frequency of the required performance of certain capital calculations and clarify that certain non-interest-bearing deposit accounts (such as settlement, payment or other 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 transactional accounts) are to be considered unsecured extensions of credit subject to the Capital Regulation s unsecured general or overall (less restrictive) limit. Although excluding IBDAs from the general unsecured credit limit could provide greater flexibility for an FHLBank s liquidity management, several of the other proposed changes, if adopted, could result in significant changes to our current business processes. We are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on our financial condition and operations. 
 
 Proposed Rule on Federal Home Loan Bank System Boards of Directors and Executive Management . On October 21, 2024, the FHFA proposed revisions to its regulations addressing boards of directors and overall corporate governance of the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. The comment deadline will be 90 days after the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. If adopted as presented, the proposed rule would, among other things: (1) impact director compensation by allowing the Director of the FHFA to establish an annual amount of director compensation that the Director determines is reasonable; (2) require the Bank to complete and submit background checks to the FHFA on every nominee for a directorship; (3) impact public interest independent director qualifications, in part by requiring a person to have advocated for, or otherwise acted primarily on behalf of or for the direct benefit of, consumers or the community to meet the representation requirement; (4) expand the list of qualifying experiences for all FHLBank independent directors to include artificial intelligence, information technology and security, climate-related risk, Community Development Financial Institutions, business models, and modeling; and (5) establish a review process for director performance and participation, together with a process for removing FHLBank directors for cause. Other proposed revisions address, among other things, FHLBank conflicts of interest policies, covering all FHLBank employees, including specific limitations on executive officers and senior management and record retention policies. 
 
 While some proposed revisions would codify existing guidance and practice, several of the proposed revisions could result in significant changes to the nomination, election and retention of our board of directors. Additional director eligibility requirements and limitations on and potential reductions or limitations to director compensation resulting from the proposed rule could hinder the Bank s ability to recruit and retain directors having the talent and expertise critical to the Bank s ability to satisfy its mission, particularly given the growing complexities of the finance industry. We continue to analyze the impact that the proposed rule could have on us. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Sources and Types of Market and Interest-Rate Risk 
 
 Our balance sheet is comprised of different portfolios that require different market- and interest-rate-risk management strategies. The majority of our balance sheet is comprised of assets that can be funded individually or collectively without imposing significant residual interest-rate risk on ourselves. Sources and types of market and interest-rate risk are described in Part II Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Sources and Types of Market and Interest-Rate Risk in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Strategies to Manage Market and Interest-Rate Risk 
 
 General 
 
 We use various strategies and techniques to manage our market- and interest-rate risk including the following and combinations of the following: 
 
 the issuance of COs that can be used to match interest-rate-risk exposures of our assets; 
 the issuance of COs with embedded call options to mitigate interest-rate and prepayment risks of our mortgage loans and certain MBS; 
 the issuance of COs together with interest-rate swaps (either cleared if no optionality or uncleared if containing optionality) that receive a coupon rate that offsets the cost of the debt and any optionality embedded in the debt, thereby effectively creating a floating-rate liability; 
 the issuance of advances together with interest-rate swaps that pay a coupon rate that offsets the advance coupon rate and any optionality embedded in the advance, thereby effectively creating a floating-rate asset; 
 the purchase of available-for-sale securities together with interest-rate swaps that pay a coupon rate that offsets the security s coupon rate, thereby effectively creating a floating-rate asset; 
 contractual provisions for certain advances that require borrowers to pay us prepayment fees, to make us financially indifferent if the borrower prepays such advances prior to maturity; and 
 the use of derivatives to hedge the interest-rate risk of anticipated future CO debt issuance.

 Measurement of Market and Interest-Rate Risk and Related Policy Constraints 
 
 We measure our exposure to market and interest-rate risk using several techniques applied to the balance sheet and to certain portfolios within the balance sheet. Principal among these measurements as applied to the balance sheet is the potential change in market value of equity (MVE) and interest income due to potential changes in interest rates, interest-rate volatility, spreads, and market prices. We also measure Value at Risk (VaR), duration of equity, MVE sensitivity, and the other metrics discussed below. 
 
 MVE is the net economic value of total assets and liabilities, including any derivative transactions. In contrast to the GAAP-based shareholders' equity account, MVE represents the shareholders' equity account in present-value terms. Specifically, MVE equals the difference between the estimated market value of our assets and the estimated market value of our liabilities, net of derivative transactions. 
 
 MVE and, in particular, the ratio of MVE to the book value of equity (BVE), is a measure of the current value of shareholder investment based on market rates, spreads, prices, and volatility at the reporting date. However, these valuations may not be fully representative of future realized prices. Valuations are based on market yields and prices of individual assets, liabilities, and derivatives, and therefore embed elements of option, credit, and liquidity risk which may not be representative of future net income to be earned from the spread between asset yields and funding costs. Further, MVE does not consider future new business activities, or income or expense derived from sources other than financial assets or liabilities. For purposes of measuring this ratio, the BVE is equal to the par value of capital stock including mandatorily redeemable capital stock, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. 
 
 We measure our exposure to market and interest-rate risk using several metrics, including: 
 
 the ratio of MVE to BVE; 
 the ratio of MVE to the par value of our Class B Stock (Par Stock), which we refer to as the MVE to Par Stock ratio; 
 the ratio of MVE to the market value of assets, which we refer to as the economic capital ratio; 
 the ratio of MVE to Par Stock subjected to a +/- 2 standard deviation basis shock of the overnight-index swap rate based on the federal funds effective rate (Federal Funds-OIS), SOFR, Treasury and CO curves; 
 VaR, which measures the potential change in our MVE, based on a set of stress scenarios (VaR Stress Scenarios) using historically-based interest-rate, volatility, and Option Adjusted Spread (OAS) movements starting at the most recent 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 month-end and going back monthly to 1998. For risk-based capital purposes and compliance with our internal management action trigger, VaR is reported as the average of the five worst case scenarios. 
 duration of equity, which is calculated as the estimated percentage change to MVE for a 100 basis point parallel shift in rates; 
 MVE sensitivity, which is the estimated percent change in MVE in various shocked interest rate scenarios versus base case MVE; 
 the duration gap of our assets and liabilities, which is the difference between the estimated durations (percentage change in market value for a 100 basis point shift in rates) of assets and liabilities (including the effect of related hedges) and reflects the extent to which estimated sensitivities to market changes, including, but not limited to, maturity and repricing cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched; and 
 the use of an income-simulation model that projects net interest income over a range of potential interest-rate scenarios, including parallel interest-rate shocks, nonparallel interest-rate shocks, and basis changes. 
 
 We maintain limits and management action triggers in connection with some of the foregoing metrics. Those limits, management action triggers, and the foregoing market and interest-rate risk metrics are more fully discussed under Part II Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Measurement of Market and Interest-Rate Risk and Related Policy Constraints in the 2023 Annual Report.

 (1) Metrics for measuring against the management action triggers and limits are calculated using a methodology which does not constrain interest rates to a minimum of zero percent. Additional metrics are calculated in accordance with guidance from the FHFA, which requires that we constrain projected future interest rates and discounting yields to a minimum of zero percent. Due to the significant increase in interest rates for the periods ended March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the results of the constrained and unconstrained metrics were the same. 
 
 Value at Risk. VaR, which measures the potential change in our MVE, is based on a set of stress scenarios using historically based interest-rate, volatility, and OAS movements starting at the most recent month-end and going back monthly to 1998. For risk-based capital purposes and compliance with our internal management action trigger, VaR is reported as the average of the five worst scenarios. 
 
 The table below presents the VaR estimate as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and represents the estimates of potential reduction to our MVE from potential future changes in interest rates and other market factors, as described above.

 _____________________________ 
 (1) Loss exposure is expressed as a percentage of base MVE. 
 
 In certain months during 2024 and 2023, we exceeded our VaR management action trigger. For example, as of July 31, 2024, our VaR measured 13.4 percent of the base case MVE, which exceeded our management action trigger of 12 percent. The VaR calculation is based on a combination of interest-rate, volatility and OAS shock model inputs provided by the FHFA for establishment of the market risk component of our risk-based capital requirement. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the OAS shocks as provided by the FHFA were significantly increased from prior periods, which resulted in an increased VaR absent an equivalent change in the composition of the balance sheet or exposures as measured by other market risk metrics. The higher OAS shocks are a result of changes made by the FHFA to the assumption underlying this calculation in connection with the cessation of LIBOR in 2023. The potential exists for the FHFA to further change the OAS, interest-rate, and volatility shocks in the future. Senior management decided not to take action because the OAS shocks are applied to only assets and they believed that capital levels were sufficient relative to the metric. 
 
 Income Simulation. To provide an additional perspective on market and interest-rate risks, we have an income-simulation model that projects adjusted net income over the ensuing 12-month period using a range of potential interest-rate scenarios, including parallel interest-rate shocks, nonparallel interest-rate shocks, and changes in basis risk. The income simulation metric is based on projections of adjusted net income divided by capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock). Projections of adjusted net income exclude: a) projected prepayment of advances and prepayment penalties; b) loss on early extinguishment of debt; c) changes in fair values from hedging activities; and d) changes in fair values of trading securities. The simulations are solely based on simulated movements in interest rates and do not reflect potential impacts of credit events, including, but not limited to, potential provision for credit losses. 
 
 Management has put in place management action triggers whereby senior management is explicitly informed of instances where our projected return on capital stock (ROCS) falls below the average yield on SOFR plus our current dividend spread over a twelve-month horizon in a variety of interest-rate shock scenarios limited to +/- 200 basis points and a +/- 2 standard deviation historically based immediate shock to basis spreads followed by an incremental reversion to current levels over 12 months. Our ROCS spread to SOFR remained above this management action trigger minimum during 2024. The results of this analysis for September 30, 2024, showed that in the base case our ROCS was 492 basis points over SOFR, and in the worst case modeled, the down 200 basis points scenario, our ROCS fell 125 basis points to 367 basis points over SOFR. For December 31, 2023, the results of this analysis showed in the base case our ROCS was 671 basis points over SOFR, and in the worst case modeled, the down 200 basis point scenario, our ROCS fell 224 basis points to 447 basis points over SOFR.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of controls and procedures. 
 
 Our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, with the participation of the president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024.
