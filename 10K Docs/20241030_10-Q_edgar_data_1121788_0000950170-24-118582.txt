The primary objectives of the Company s investment policy are to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. The fair value of securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, the performance of the underlying collateral, and the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. Accrued interest receivable, which totale d as of September 28, 2024 , is excluded from both the fair value and amortized cost basis of available-for-sale securities and is included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company writes off impaired accrued interest on a timely basis, generally within 30 days of the due date, by reversing interest income. accrued interest was written off during the 39-week period ended September 28, 2024. The Company recognizes impairments relating to credit losses of available-for-sale securities through an allowance for credit losses and other income (expense) on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of income. Impairment not relating to credit losses is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Approximately of securities in the Company s portfolio were at an unrealized loss position as of September 28, 2024.

As of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 , the Company had t recognized an allowance for credit losses on any securities in an unrealized loss position. The Company has t recorded an allowance for credit losses and charge to other income (expense) for the unrealized losses on agency, mortgage-backed, corporate debt, municipal, and other securities presented above because the Company does not consider the declines in fair value to have resulted from credit losses. The Company has not observed a significant deterioration in credit quality of these securities, which are highly rated with moderate to low credit risk. Declines in value are largely attributable to current global economic conditions. The securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments, and the fair values are expected to recover as they approach maturity. Management does not intend to sell the securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities, before the respective recoveries of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity.

This restricted cash is reported within other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and totaled and on September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. The total of the cash and cash equivalents balance and the restricted cash reported within other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets equals the total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Contingencies Management of the Company currently does not believe it is reasonably possible that the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of recorded accruals, with respect to loss contingencies in the aggregate, for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024. The results of legal proceedings, investigations and claims, however, cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse resolution of one or more of such matters in excess of management s expectations could have a material adverse effect in the particular quarter or fiscal year in which a loss is recorded, but based on information currently known, the Company does not believe it is likely that losses from such matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company s Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the CODM, primarily uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss to assess segment performance and allocate resources. Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses. Net sales are directly attributed to each segment. Most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment, while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a reasonable manner considering the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated.

We also sell our products and services directly through our online webshop (garmin.com), subscriptions for connected services, and our own retail stores. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 As indicated in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company changed the presentation of operating expense to include advertising expense within selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income, which management believes to be a more meaningful presentation. 
 
 This change in presentation had no effect on the Company's consolidated operating or net income. The amounts presented below for selling, general and administrative expenses for the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 30, 2023 have been recast to conform with the current period presentation.

Net sales increased 24 for the 13-week period ended September 28, 2024 when compared to the year-ago quarter. Total unit sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased to 4,620 when compared to total unit sales of 3,997 in the third quarter of 2023, which differs from the percent increase in revenue primarily due to shifts in segment and product mix. Outdoor was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 33 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 34 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The increase in fitness revenue was driven by sales growth across all categories, led by strong demand for wearables. Outdoor revenue increased primarily due to sales growth in adventure watches. The increase in aviation revenue was driven by sales growth in aftermarket product categories. The increase in marine revenue was primarily driven by contributions from the Company's acquisition of JL Audio. Auto OEM revenue increased primarily due to growth in domain controllers.

Gross profit dollars in the third quarter of 2024 increased 31 , primarily due to the increase in net sales when compared to the year-ago quarter, as described above. Consolidated gross margin increased 300 basis points when compared to the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower costs of goods and favorable product mix within certain segments, partially offset by unfavorable segment mix. 
 
 The fitness, outdoor, and marine gross margin increases of 710 basis points, 570 basis points, and 290 basis points, respectively, were primarily attributable to lower costs of goods and favorable product mix. The aviation gross margin was relatively flat when compared to the year-ago quarter. The auto OEM gross margin decrease of 180 basis points was primarily attributable to unfavorable product mix.

Total operating income in the third quarter of 2024 increased 62 in absolute dollars and increased 640 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating income as a percent of revenue was driven by increased sales, increased gross margin as a percent of revenue, and lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue, as described above. The improved performance in fitness, outdoor, marine, and auto OEM was partially offset by a decrease in aviation.

The average interest rate return on cash and investments during the third quarter of 2024 was 3.3 , compared to 2.8 during the same quarter of 2023. 
 
 Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are driven by movements of a number of currencies in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the Euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries, and the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds. Other notable currency exposures include the Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, and Polish Zloty. The majority of the Company s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. 
 
 The 18.1 million currency gain recognized in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar weakening against the British Pound Sterling, Euro, and Polish Zloty, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Taiwan Dollar, within the 13-week period ended September 28, 2024. During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 3.7 against the British Pound Sterling, 4.2 against the Euro, and 5.3 against the Polish Zloty, resulting in gains of 3.2 million, 8.9 million, and 9.3 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.9 against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of 10.4 million. The remaining net currency gain of 7.1 million was related to the impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial. 
 
 The 11.5 million currency loss recognized in the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Polish Zloty, Australian Dollar, and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar within the 13-week period ended September 30, 2023. During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 6.8 against the Polish Zloty, 2.9 against the Australian Dollar, and 4.0 against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of 18.4 million, 2.4 million, and 1.9 million, respectively, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 3.4 against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of 15.2 million. The remaining net currency loss of 4.0 million was related to the impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.

Income Tax Provision 
 
 The Company recorded income tax expense of 87.1 million in the 13-week period ended September 28, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 22.3 million in the 13-week period ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 17.9 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 8.0 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in effective tax rate between comparative periods was primarily due to the increase in the combined federal and cantonal Switzerland statutory tax rate in response to the implementation of global minimum tax requirements. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 As a result of the above, net income for the 13-week period ended September 28, 2024 was 399.1 million compared to 257.2 million for the 13-week period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 141.9 million.

Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are driven by movements of a number of currencies in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the Euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries, and the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds. Other notable currency exposures include the Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, and Polish Zloty. The majority of the Company s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. 
 
 The 15.6 million currency gain recognized in the 39-week period ended September 28, 2024 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar within the 39-week period ended September 28, 2024. During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 2.8 against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of 19.6 million. The remaining net currency loss of 4.0 million was related to the impacts of other drivers, each of which was individually immaterial. 
 
 The 6.9 million currency gain recognized in the 39-week period ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen and U.S. Dollar volatility with the Polish Zloty within the 39-week period ended September 30, 2023. During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.9 against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of 21.1 million, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 5.2 against the Australian Dollar, 4.6 against the Chinese Yuan, and 12.2 against the Japanese Yen, resulting in losses of 2.9 million, 2.9 million, and 2.8 million, respectively, while volatility with the Polish Zloty resulted in a net loss of 4.5 million as the loss in the third quarter more than offset gains in previous quarters. The remaining net currency loss of 1.1 million was related to the impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 
 The Company recorded income tax expense of 203.6 million in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to income tax expense of 69.8 million in the first three quarters of 2023. The effective tax rate was 17.3 in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to 8.5 in the first three quarters of 2023. The increase in effective tax rate between comparative periods was primarily due to the increase in the combined federal and cantonal Switzerland statutory tax rate in response to the implementation of global minimum tax requirements. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 As a result of the above, net income for the 39-week period ended September 28, 2024 was 975.7 million compared to 747.5 million for the 39-week period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 228.2 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements may be used, to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund share repurchases, and fund strategic acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our short- and long-term projected working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other cash requirements. 
 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had approximately 3.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management invests idle or surplus cash in accordance with the Company's investment policy, which has been approved by the Company s Board of Directors. The investment policy s primary objectives are to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 3.3 and 2.6 , respectively. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, the performance of the underlying collateral, and the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Note 4 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding marketable securities. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled 948.6 million for the first three quarters of 2024, compared to 910.3 million for the first three quarters of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers primarily driven by higher net sales as well as less cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by increases in cash paid for cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023. 
 21 

Cash used in investing activities totaled 190.8 million for the first three quarters of 2024, compared to 267.7 million for the first three quarters of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to net redemptions of marketable securities in the first three quarters of 2023. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities totaled 449.4 million for the first three quarters of 2024, compared to 486.2 million for the first three quarters of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower purchases of treasury shares under share repurchase plans and partially offset by higher cash dividend payments in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the first three quarters of 2023. 
 
 Use of Cash 
 
 Operating Leases 
 
 The Company has lease arrangements for certain real estate properties, vehicles, and equipment. Leased properties are typically used for office space, distribution, and retail. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of 161.8 million, with 33.4 million payable within 12 months. 
 
 Inventory Purchase Obligations 
 
 The Company obtains various raw materials and components for its products from a variety of third party suppliers. The Company s inventory purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had inventory purchase obligations of 847.2 million, with 673.2 million payable within 12 months. 
 
 Other Purchase Obligations 
 
 The Company s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had other purchase obligations of 316.6 million, with 122.1 million payable within 12 months. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 General 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The presentation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 For a description of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. There were no significant changes to the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates in the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 28, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 There are numerous market risks that can affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. There have been no material changes during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 28, 2024 in the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K related to market sensitivity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. As of September 28, 2024, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures.

 Article 4. Shares Subject to the Plan 
 
 4.1 	 Number of Shares Available . 
 (a) 	 Plan Limit. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, the number of Shares hereby reserved for delivery under the Plan is eighteen million (18,000,000) Shares. The maximum number of Shares that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of Options (including incentive stock options under Code Section 422) or SARs is ten million (10,000,000) Shares. The maximum number of Shares that may be delivered as Restricted Shares or pursuant to Performance Units or Restricted Stock Units is seventeen million (17,000,000) Shares. The maximum number of Bonus Shares that may be awarded is one million (1,000,000) Shares. If any Shares subject to an Award granted hereunder are forfeited or an Award or any portion thereof otherwise terminates or is settled without the issuance of Shares, the Shares subject to such Award, to the extent of any such forfeiture, termination or settlement, shall again be available for grant under the Plan. The Board may from time to time determine the appropriate methodology for calculating the number of Shares issued pursuant to the Plan. 
 Page 6 of 18 

(b) 	 Individual Limit. No individual Grantee may be granted Options, SARs, Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units, Bonus Shares, Performance Units or Performance Shares in Shares, or in any combination thereof, relating to an aggregate number of Shares under the Plan that exceeds two million (2,000,000) Shares in any 5-year period. If a previously granted Option, SAR, Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Unit, or Performance Share is forfeited, canceled or repriced, such forfeited, canceled or repriced Award as the case may be, shall continue to be counted against the maximum number of Shares subject to Awards that may be delivered to any Grantee under this Section 4.1(b). 
 4.2 	 Adjustments in Shares . 
 (a) 	 Adjustment Principle . In the event that the Board determines that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, share split, reverse share split, subdivision, consolidation or reduction of capital, reorganization, merger, scheme of arrangement, split-up, spin-off or combination involving the Company or repurchase or exchange of Shares or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that any adjustment is determined by the Board to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Board shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property of the Company or any Person that is a party to a Reorganization Transaction with the Company) with respect to which Awards may be granted, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property of the Company or any Person that is a party to a Reorganization Transaction with the Company) subject to outstanding Awards, and (iii) the grant or exercise price with respect to any Award or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding Award or the substitution of other property for Shares subject to an outstanding Award; provided, that the number of Shares subject to any Award denominated in Shares shall always be a whole number. 
 (b) 	 Example. By way of illustration, and not by way of limitation, the following illustrates how the foregoing adjustment principles would apply in the context of a stock split: Assume a Grantee holds an Option to purchase 1,000 shares of Company stock at an Option Price of 50 per share. Assume further that the Company completes a two-for-one share split such that every shareholder on the requisite record date receives two Shares for every one Share held on the record date. Pursuant to the adjustment principles set forth above in Section 4.2(a), the Grantee s Option would be adjusted such that, after such adjustment, the Grantee would hold an Option to purchase 2,000 Shares at an Option Price of 25 per Share. All other terms and conditions of the Option would remain the same. Similar adjustment principles would apply to SARs, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Bonus Shares and Deferred Shares. This Section 4.2(b) is for illustrative purposes only, assumes hypothetical facts, and shall not, under any event or circumstance, be interpreted as the adjustment outcome with respect to specific factual situations.

 6.4 	 Grant of Incentive Stock Options . 
 (a) 	At the time of the grant of any Option to an Eligible Person who is an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, the Board may designate that such option shall be made subject to additional restrictions to permit it to qualify as an incentive stock option under the requirements of Section 422 of the Code.

 (A) 	the portion of the Current Grant which would, when added to any Prior Grants, be exercisable with respect to Shares which would have an aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the respective Grant Date for such options) in excess of the 100,000 Limit shall, notwithstanding the terms of the Current Grant, be exercisable for the first time by the Grantee in the first subsequent calendar year or years in which it could be exercisable for the first time by the Grantee when added to all Prior Grants without exceeding the 100,000 Limit; and 
 (B) 	if, viewed as of the date of the Current Grant, any portion of a Current Grant could not be exercised under the preceding provisions of this Subsection (iv) during any calendar year commencing with the calendar year in which it is first exercisable through and including the last calendar year in which it may by its terms be exercised, such portion of the Current Grant shall not be an incentive stock option, but shall be exercisable as a separate Option at such date or dates as are provided in the Current Grant; 
 (v) 	shall be granted within 10 years from the earlier of the date the Plan is adopted or the date the Plan is approved by the shareholders of the Company;

(vii) 	shall by its terms not be assignable or transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and may be exercised, during the Grantee s lifetime, only by the Grantee; provided, however, that the Grantee may, to the extent provided in the Plan in any manner specified by the Board, designate in writing a beneficiary to exercise such incentive stock option after the Grantee s death. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may, without the consent of the Grantee, at any time before the exercise of an option (whether or not an incentive stock option), take any action necessary to prevent such option from being treated as an incentive stock option. 
 6.5 	 Exercise of Options . Options shall be exercised by the delivery of a written notice of exercise to the Company or its designee, setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for the Shares as instructed by the Board or, subject to the approval of the Board pursuant to procedures approved by the Board, 
 (a) 	through the sale of the Shares acquired on exercise of the Option through a broker-dealer to whom the Grantee has submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise and irrevocable instructions to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds sufficient to pay for such Shares, together with, if requested by the Company, the amount of federal, state, local or foreign withholding taxes payable by Grantee by reason of such exercise, 
 (b) 	through simultaneous sale through a broker of Shares acquired on exercise, as permitted under Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, 
 (c) 	by transfer to the Company of the number of Shares then owned by the Grantee, the Fair Market Value of which equals the purchase price of the Shares purchased in connection with the Option exercise, properly endorsed for transfer to the Company; provided however, that Shares used for this purpose must have been held by the Grantee for such minimum period of time as may be established from time to time by the Board; and provided further that the Fair Market Value of any Shares delivered in payment of the purchase price upon exercise of the Options shall be the Fair Market Value as of the exercise date, which shall be the date of delivery of the certificates for the Stock used as payment of the exercise price. For purposes of this Section 6.5(c), in lieu of actually transferring to the Company the number of Shares then owned by the Grantee, the Board may, in its discretion permit the Grantee to submit to the Company a statement affirming ownership by the Grantee of such number of Shares and request that such Shares, although not actually transferred, be deemed to have been transferred by the Grantee as payment of the exercise price, or 
 (d) 	by a net exercise arrangement pursuant to which the Company will not require a payment of the Option Price but will reduce the number of Shares upon the exercise by the largest number of whole shares that has a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise that does not exceed the aggregate Option Price. With respect to any remaining balance of the aggregate option price, the Company will accept a cash payment from the Grantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a net exercise arrangement will not be an eligible exercise method for incentive stock options unless and until the Company and its advisors conclude that such method of exercise may be utilized without resulting in a disqualification of the incentive stock option.

The value of the payment with respect to the Tandem SAR may be no more than 100 of the difference between the Option Price of the underlying Option and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the underlying Option at the time the Tandem SAR is exercised. 
 7.4 	 Expiration of SARs . A SAR granted under the Plan shall expire on the date set forth in the SAR Award Agreement, which date shall be determined by the Board in its sole discretion. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in the SAR Award agreement, a Tandem SAR granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time or times and only to the extent that the related Option is exercisable. The Tandem SAR shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the termination or exercise of the related Options, except that Tandem SARs granted with respect to less than the full number of Shares covered by a related Option shall not be reduced until the exercise or termination of the related Option exceeds the number of Shares not covered by the SARs. 
 7.5 	 Payment of SAR Amount . Upon exercise of a SAR, a Grantee shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the positive difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price per Share by (ii) the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.

 8.4 	 Consideration . The Board shall determine the amount, if any, that a Grantee shall pay for Restricted Shares or Bonus Shares.

 8.5 	 Effect of Forfeiture . If Restricted Shares are forfeited, and if the Grantee was required to pay for such shares or acquired such Restricted Shares upon the exercise of an Option, the Grantee shall resell such Restricted Shares to the Company at a price equal to the lesser of (x) the amount paid by the Grantee for such Restricted Shares, or (y) the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of such forfeiture. The Company shall pay to the Grantee the required amount as soon as is administratively practical. 
 8.6 	 Escrow . The Board may provide that any Restricted Shares or Bonus Shares shall be represented by, at the option of the Board, either book entry registration or by a stock certificate or certificates.

RSU Accounts shall be maintained for recordkeeping purposes only and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate or set aside assets representing securities or other amounts credited to RSU Accounts. The obligation to make distributions of securities or other amounts credited to RSU Accounts shall be an unfunded, unsecured obligation of the Company. 
 9.4 	 Settlement of RSU Accounts . The Company shall settle an RSU Account by delivering to the holder thereof (which may be the Grantee or his or her Beneficiary, as applicable) a number of Shares equal to the whole number of Shares underlying the Restricted Stock Units then credited to the Grantee s RSU Account (or a specified portion in the event of any partial settlement); provided that any fractional Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units remaining in the RSU Account on the Settlement Date shall be distributed in cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the Settlement Date multiplied by the remaining fractional Restricted Share Unit.
