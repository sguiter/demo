The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on trade receivables, which is recorded as an offset to trade receivables. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are included as a component of operating expenses in the Statements of Comprehensive Income. The Company assesses credit losses on its entire balance of trade receivables. 
 
 The allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the receivable (contractual term). The Company considers historical loss rates and current economic conditions when determining the expected credit losses. Receivables deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses was at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

All existing options expire years from the date of grant, subject to early termination months after termination of employment or service due to death, disability, or termination other than for cause. The grants include a provision providing for acceleration of vesting upon a change of control in the Company. 

As of September 30, 2024 , the total unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding stock options was , which the Company expects to recognize through April 2028.

Restricted stock units 

The 2013 Plan authorizes the issuance of restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation expense is determined on the grant date based on the closing market value of the Company's common stock. The amount of expense is calculated based on an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest at the end of each vesting period and is expensed evenly over the vesting period. In connection with the time of vesting and issuance of shares, an eligible recipient of common stock may elect to have some shares withheld by the Company to satisfy any requirement for withholding taxes. The grants include a provision providing for acceleration of vesting upon a change of control in the Company. 

In the third quarter of 2023, the Company granted restricted stock units to its Chief Executive Officer and restricted stock units to each of its non-employee board members. The restricted stock units all vest on the first anniversary of the grant and annually thereafter.

Item 2 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 The Pri vate Securitie s Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. We have made, and may continue to make, forward-looking statements with respect to our business and financial matters, including statements contained in this document, other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and reports to shareholders. Forward-looking statements generally include discussion of current expectations or forecasts of future events and can be identified by the use of terminology such as believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, could, will, and similar words or expressions. Any statement that does not relate solely to historical fact should be considered forward-looking. 
 Our forward-looking statements generally relate to our growth strategy, future financial results, product development, and sales efforts. We make forward-looking statements throughout this Form 10-Q, but primarily in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section. These include statements relating to our beliefs and expectations and intentions with respect to (i) our growth and profitability, (ii) our marketing and product development, (iii) our ability to continue to obtain parts and materials for our products from various manufacturers and distributors in a timely manner and at reasonable prices, (iv) the value of our intellectual property, (v) our competitive position in the marketplace, (vi) the effect of governmental regulations on our business, (vii) our employee relations, (viii) the adequacy of our facilities, (ix) our intention to develop new products, (x) the possibility of us acquiring compatible businesses or product lines as part of our growth strategy, and (xi) our future cash requirements and use of cash. 
 Forward-looking statements cannot be guaranteed and our actual results may vary materially due to the uncertainties and risks, known and unknown, associated with these statements, including our ability to successfully develop new products and manage our cash requirements. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We cannot foresee or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results. As such, investors should not consider any list of these factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks, uncertainties, or potentially inaccurate assumptions. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ materially from our recent results listed under the heading Forward-Looking Statements under Item 1 Business, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make decisions based upon estimates, assumptions, and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances. These decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application and affect reported amounts and disclosures. Changes in economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of management s estimates and assumptions. An in-depth description of our accounting estimates can be found in the interim financial statements included in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 . There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.

The following paragraphs discuss the Company s performance for t he three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (in thousands) 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 were 2,512 , an increase of 455 , or 22.1 , from 2,057 during the comparable period in 2023 . Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6,973 , an increase of 734 , or 11.8 , from 6,239 during the comparable period in 2023 . The increases during the three and nine-month periods were driven by increased sales of our wired sensor products utilized in industrial and OEM applications, and increased sales of HazardPRO wireless hazard monitoring systems utilized in agricultural applications. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was 1,265 , an increase of 272 , or 27.4 , over the same period in 2023 . Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,392 , an increase of 309 , or 10.0 , from the same period in 2023 . Gross margin increased in the third quarter of 2024 to 50.4 from 48.3 during the same period in 2023 . Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 48.6 from 49.4 over the same period in 2023 . The increase in gross margin for the quarter was primarily due to an increase in average selling prices for specific items as a result of an increase in material and labor costs. The decrease in gross margin for the nine-month period was primarily due to increased material and labor costs across all product lines, partially offset by the increase in average selling prices noted. 

17 

Operating Expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses increased 73 , or 7.2 , to 1,092 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 , but decreased as a percentage of net sales to 43.5 from 49.5 . Total operating expenses increased 223 , or 7.0 , to 3,426 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 , but decreased as a percentage of net sales to 49.1 from 51.3 . The increase in operating expenses for both periods was primarily due to costs associated with additional employee and contract headcount and variable sales compensation. In addition, the increase for the nine-month period was also due to stock-based compensation related to the granting of stock options and restricted stock units in 2023 and 2024. 

Selling and marketing expenses in the third quarter of 2024 increased 33 to 340 , or 10.7 , from the same period in 2023 , but decreased as a percentage of net sales to 13.5 from 14.9 . Selling and marketing expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 23 to 1,044 , or 2.3 , from the same period in 2023 , but decreased as a percentage of net sales to 15.0 from 16.3 . The increase for both periods was primarily due to higher variable compensation due to increased net sales. 

General and administrative expenses increased 23 to 517 , or 4.7 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 , but decreased as a percentage of net sales to 20.6 from 24.0 . General and administrative expenses increased 163 to 1,621 , or 11.2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 , but decreased as a percentage of net sales to 23.2 from 23.4 . The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to higher contract labor costs. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation and contract labor costs, partially offset by a decrease in legal and professional fees. 

Research and development expenses increased 17 to 235 , or 7.8 , i n the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 , but decreased as a percentage of net sales to 9.4 from 10.6 . Research and development expenses increased 37 to 761 , or 5.1 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 , but decreased as a percentage of net sales to 10.9 from 11.6 . The increase for the three-month period was due to additional headcount. The increase for the six-month period was due to additional headcount, partially offset by lower contract engineering costs related to product development and enhancements. 

Non-Operating Income 
 
 Net non-operating income increased by 8 , or 7.3 , for the three - month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 . Net non-operating income increased by 46 , or 15.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 . The increase for both periods is the result of additional interest income earned as a result of higher interest rates on Treasury Bills. 
 
 Income Before Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income before income tax expense was 290 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 , representing an increase of 207 compared to 83 for the same period in 2023 . Income before income tax expense was 308 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , representing an increase of 132 compared to 176 for the same period in 2023 . The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher sales, gross profit and an increase in interest income, partially offset by higher operating expenses, as discussed above.

 Income tax expense was 52 , or 2.1 of net sales, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 75 , or 3.6 of net sales, in the third quarter of 2023 . Income tax expense was 63 , or 0.9 of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 96 , or 1.5 of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 20.5 compared to 54.5 in the same period of 2023 . The 2023 effective income tax rate was higher than normal due to the write-off of deferred tax assets in conjunction with the expiration of stock options in the period. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 10,246 at September 30, 2024 and 9,870 at December 31, 2023 . The increase was primarily the result of an increase in cash from operating activities. 
 
 Cash from operating activities was 406 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 255 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The 151 increase in cash from operating activities was due primarily to an increase in net income and accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in inventories. The increase in net income is due to increased net sales and gross profit. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to increased variable compensation due to increased sales and increased accrued wages due to timing of payments and additional headcount. The increase in inventories is primarily due to the timing of receipt of inventory and increased labor and material costs. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 30 and 1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash used in both periods was for the purchase of office equipment. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 5 . There was no cash flow from financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Subject to the following section, entitled "Supply Chain and Labor Dynamics," the Company believes its ongoing cash requirements will be primarily for capital expenditures, research, and development, working capital, corporate and business development, and other strategic alternatives and that existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments and any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet these cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. 
 
 Supply Chain and Labor Dynamics 
 
 We strive to have multiple sources of production components and materials. While we believe our supply chain has begun to stabilize, we still occasionally see unexpected price and delivery situations requiring us to intervene and remediate. To meet these challenges, we are seeking additional sources for components and modifying product designs to accommodate new components that are more readily available at competitive prices. There is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in modifying these designs and sourcing alternative components. As a result, we could experience significant delays in receiving certain components needed to make timely customer deliveries, as well as increased costs that erode gross margins. Supply chain dynamics may have an effect on the efficiency of our business operations, our customer base, and the domestic or worldwide economy. Furthermore, the labor market for qualified employees able to fill our various open positions is challenging and may result in delays in filling these positions and increased labor costs. In addition, we may experience changes in transportation and freight availability that may make it difficult to have materials and components shipped to us, or our products shipped to customers, in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we continue to closely manage each of these activities, our actions may not be successful and may result in a negative effect on our sales and profit margins.

Future Corporate and Business Development Activities 
 
 We continue to seek growth opportunities, both internally through our existing portfolio of products, technologies, and markets, as well as externally through technology partnerships or related-product or business acquisitions. In addition, we continue to explore other strategic alternatives that we believe present good opportunities for the Company and its shareholders. The Company's Board of Directors has a special committee to explore and pursue business development and other strategic alternatives.
