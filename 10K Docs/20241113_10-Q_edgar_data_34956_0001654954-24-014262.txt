Overview The Company was originally formed as a New Jersey corporation in 1967 under the name Rudmer, David Associates, Inc., and subsequently changed its name to Synthetic Blood International, Inc. Effective June 30, 2008, we changed the domiciliary state of the corporation to Delaware and changed the Company name to Oxygen Biotherapeutics, Inc. On September 19, 2014, the Company changed its name to Tenax Therapeutics, Inc. In November 2013, we acquired a license with Orion Corporation Orion granting our wholly-owned subsidiary an exclusive, sublicensable right to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products containing levosimendan, 2.5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion / 5ml vial in the United States and Canada. In October 2020 and January 2022, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement between the Company and Orion to include in the scope of the license two new oral product formulations containing levosimendan, in capsule and solid dosage form (TNX-103) and a subcutaneously administered dosage form (TNX-102), subject to specified limitations. In February 2024, we entered into an additional amendment to the license, providing global rights to oral and subcutaneous formulations of levosimendan used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction PH-HFpEF ), revising the royalty structure, lowering the royalty rates, modifying milestones associated with certain regulatory and commercial achievements, and excluding from our right of first refusal the right to commercialize new applications of levosimendan for neurological diseases and disorders developed by Orion. In January 2021, we acquired 100 of the equity of PHPrecisionMed Inc., a Delaware corporation PHPM ), with PHPM surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result of the merger, we have rights to commercialize pharmaceutical products containing imatinib for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH ). In August 2024, we closed a private placement financing (the August 2024 Offering in which we sold to multiple accredited investors, including certain members of the Company s Board of Directors, an aggregate of 1,450,661 shares of the Company s common stock, and pre-funded warrants Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 31,882,671 shares of the Company s common stock, along with accompanying warrants Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 16,666,666 shares of the Company s common stock (or, in lieu thereof, additional Pre-Funded Warrants) for gross process of approximately 99.7 million, before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. We intend to use the net proceeds from the August 2024 Offering to complete our ongoing Phase 3 LEVEL trial, to initiate all sites and advance enrollment in a second planned Phase 3 trial of oral levosimendan, and for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. The approximately 99.7 million in gross proceeds from the August 2024 Offering, combined with the Company s current cash and cash equivalents, are expected to fund the Company s operations through the end of 2027. Business Strategy Having raised capital expected to fund the Company through the end of 2027, the Company plans to accelerate its Phase 3 program. Site selection and initiation processes, and enrollment of participants, are ongoing in the Phase 3 LEVEL study, the Company having received U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA input into this oral levosimendan protocol and clinical development program in the third quarter of 2023. The Company began initiating LEVEL sites in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continues to enroll patients. The Company also plans an open label extension phase following the completion of the randomized phase. The Company will complete efficacy and safety analyses of levosimendan versus placebo at the end of the randomized treatment phase, but many patients will continue, beyond the completion of these statistical analyses, to be treated under the protocol on open label levosimendan, allowing for additional weeks of safety observation that will contribute to the overall body of safety data on oral levosimendan. With the net proceeds of the August 2024 Offering, the Company also expects to fund the initiation of a second Phase 3 study planned for 2025. The Company has two U.S. Patents, issued in March and July 2023, covering the use of IV and oral levosimendan in patients with PH-HFpEF. An additional new patent was issued in early 2024 which provides protection covering all therapeutic doses of all three formulations of the product in patients with PH-HFpEF. Given our prioritization of the Phase 3 testing of levosimendan, we have suspended plans to launch an imatinib Phase 3 trial. 18 Table of Contents The key elements of our business strategy are outlined below. Efficiently conduct clinical development to establish clinical proof of principle in new indications, refine dosage levels and dosing strategies, conduct other required clinical and nonclinical testing as FDA and other regulators may require, and continue Phase 3 testing of oral levosimendan, as our prioritized product candidate. Levosimendan and imatinib have been approved and prescribed in countries around the world for more than 20 years, but we believe their mechanisms of action have not been fully exploited, despite promising evidence they may significantly improve the lives of patients with pulmonary hypertension. We are conducting clinical development with the intent to establish proof of beneficial activity in cardiopulmonary diseases in which these therapeutics would be expected to have benefit for patients with diseases for which either no pharmaceutical therapies are approved at all, or in the case of pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH ), where numerous, expensive therapies generally offer a modest reduction of symptoms. Our focus is primarily on designing and executing formulation improvements, protecting these innovations with patents and other forms of exclusivity, and employing innovative clinical trial science to establish a robust foundation for subsequent development, product approval, and commercialization. We intend to submit marketing authorization applications following two Phase 3 trials of levosimendan and, when appropriate, a single Phase 3 trial of imatinib. Our trials are designed to incorporate and reflect advanced clinical trial design science and the regulatory and advisory experience of our team. We intend to continue partnering with innovative companies, renowned biostatisticians and trialists, medical leaders, formulation and regulatory experts, and premier clinical testing organizations to help expedite development, and continue expanding into complementary areas when opportunities arise through our development, research, and discoveries. We also intend to continue outsourcing to CROs, and seeking and acting upon the advice of preeminent scientists focused on cardiovascular and pulmonary drug development, when designing and executing our research. Efficiently explore new high-potential therapeutic applications, in particular where expedited regulatory pathways are available, leveraging third-party research collaborations and our results from related areas . Levosimendan has shown promise in multiple disease areas in the more than two decades following its approval. Our own Phase 2 study and open-label extension has demonstrated that levosimendan s property of relaxing the venous circulation, a formerly under-appreciated mechanism of action of levosimendan, brings durable improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life, as well as other clinical assessments, in patients with PH-HFpEF. The FDA has not approved a therapy for this disease. We are committed to exploring potential clinical indications where our therapies may achieve best-in-class profile, and where we can address significant unmet medical needs. We believe these factors will support approval by the FDA of this product candidate based on positive Phase 3 data. Through our agreement with our licensor, Orion, the originator of levosimendan for acute decompensated heart failure, we have access to a library of ongoing and completed trials and research projects, including certain documentation, which we believe, in combination with positive Phase 3 data we hope to generate in at least one indication, will support FDA approval of levosimendan. Likewise, the regulatory pathway for approval of imatinib for the treatment of PAH, as formulated by us at the dose shown to be effective in a prior Phase 3 trial conducted by Novartis, allows us to build on the dossier of research results already reviewed by the FDA. In order to achieve our objective of developing these medicines for new groups of patients, we have established collaborative research relationships with investigators from leading research and clinical institutions, and our strategic partners. These collaborative relationships have enabled us to explore where our product candidates may have therapeutic relevance, gain the advice and support of key opinion leaders in medicine and clinical trial science, and invest in development efforts to exploit opportunities to advance beyond current clinical care. Continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. Our intellectual property and the confidentiality of all our Company information is important to our business and we are taking significant steps to help protect its value. Our research and development efforts, both through internal activities and through collaborative research activities with others, aim to develop new intellectual property and enable us to file patent applications that cover new uses of our existing technologies, alone or in combination with existing therapies, as well as other product candidates. 19 Table of Contents Notice of Allowance and Patents On February 1, 2023, the Company announced it was granted a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO for its patent application with claims covering the use of IV levosimendan (TNX-101) in the treatment of PH-HFpEF. This patent (U.S. Patent No. 11,607,412) was issued on March 21, 2023. On July 19, 2023, the Company announced USPTO issuance of another patent, this one including claims covering the use of oral levosimendan (TNX-103) in patients with PH-HFpEF. This issued patent (U.S. Patent No. 11,701,355) provides exclusivity through December 2040. On February 6, 2024, the Company announced it was granted a Notice of Allowance from the USPTO for its patent application broadening IP protection for oral, I.V., and subcutaneous use of levosimendan and its active metabolites in PH-HFpEF, at all therapeutic doses and in combination with various cardiovascular drugs. At present, the Company has other patent applications pending, with additional decisions expected in the future. Patents pending in Europe may lead to intellectual property protections on the use of levosimendan in patients with PH-HFpEF in 2024. Enter into licensing or product co-development arrangements. In addition to our internal development efforts, an important part of our product development strategy is to work with collaborators and partners to accelerate product development, maintain our low development and business operations costs, and broaden our commercialization capabilities globally. We believe this strategy will help us develop a portfolio of high-quality product development opportunities, enhance our clinical development and commercialization capabilities, and increase our ability to generate value from our proprietary technologies. We also continue to position ourselves to execute upon licensing and other partnering opportunities. To do so, we need to continue to maintain our strategic direction, manage and deploy our available cash efficiently, and strengthen our collaborative research development and partner relationships. Historically, we have financed our operations principally through equity and debt offerings, including private placements such as the August 2024 Offering and loans from our stockholders. Based on its current operating plan, the Company has determined that there is no longer substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Given its resources on September 30, 2024, the Company believes it can continue its operations over at least the next 12 months.

Other income increased approximately 458,000 primarily related to higher interest income on cash deposits as a result of the February 2024 Offering (as defined below) and August 2024 Offering. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Plan of Operation We have incurred losses since our inception and, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 308.6 million. We will continue to incur losses until we generate sufficient revenue to offset our expenses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for at least the next several years. We expect to incur additional expenses related to our development and potential commercialization of levosimendan and, over the long term, imatinib for PAH, and other potential indications, as well as identifying and developing other potential product candidates, and as a result, we will need to generate significant net product sales, royalty and other revenues to achieve profitability. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain approval from the FDA is costly and time consuming. The probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among other things, the quality of the product candidate s early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollment and risks inherent in the development process, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We are currently focused on developing our two product candidates, levosimendan and imatinib, and have prioritized levosimendan; however, we will need substantial additional capital in the future in order to finalize the development of levosimendan, commence its commercialization, potentially develop imatinib, and to continue with the development of other potential product candidates. 24 Table of Contents Liquidity We have financed our operations since September 1990 through the issuance of debt and equity securities and loans from stockholders. We had total current assets of approximately 99.8 million and 11.7 million and working capital of approximately 97.2 million and 8.1 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our practice is to invest excess cash, where available, in short-term money market investment instruments and high-quality government bonds. Clinical and Preclinical Product Development We are currently conducting the LEVEL trial and intend to recruit patients through 2024 and into at least the first half of 2025. Our ability to continue to pursue development of our products, including completion of a second Phase 3 oral levosimendan trial, beyond 2027, will depend on obtaining license income or outside financial resources. There is no assurance that we will obtain any license agreement or outside financing or that we will otherwise succeed in obtaining any necessary resources. Financings On August 8, 2024, we sold in the August 2024 Offering an aggregate of 1,450,661 shares of our common stock, and Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 31,882,671 shares of our common stock, along with accompanying Warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 16,666,666 shares of our common stock (or, in lieu thereof, additional Pre-Funded Warrants). The purchase price for each share and accompanying Warrant was 3.00, with the accompanying Warrant having an exercise price of 4.50 (provided, the purchase price for each Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying Warrant was 2.99, with the Pre-Funded Warrants having an exercise price of 0.01). Gross proceeds from the August 2024 Offering were approximately 99.7 million, before deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately 92.3 million, after deducting the placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the Company. On February 8, 2024, we sold in a registered public offering (the February 2024 Offering (i) an aggregate of 421,260 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,178,740 shares of our common stock and (ii) accompanying warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,200,000 shares of our common stock at a combined offering price of 5.65 per share of common stock and accompanying warrant, or 5.649 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrant, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately 9.0 million. Net proceeds of the offering were approximately 8.0 million, after deducting the placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the Company. As retrospectively adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split effected in January 2024, on February 3, 2023, we sold in a registered public offering (i) an aggregate of 86,994 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 21,341 shares of our common stock and (ii) accompanying warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 216,667 shares of our common stock at a combined offering price of 144.00 per share of common stock and accompanying warrant, or 143.92 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrant, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately 15.6 million. Net proceeds of the offering were approximately 14.1 million, after deducting the placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the Company. As retrospectively adjusted for the Reverse Stock Splits, on May 17, 2022, we sold 6,623 units in a private placement at a purchase price of 1,240.00 per unit for net proceeds of approximately 7.9 million. Each unit consisted of one unregistered pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of our common stock and one unregistered warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Cash Flows The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) operating activities (11,283,967 (4,728,992 Net cash provided by investing activities - 2,843 Net cash provided by financing activities 99,802,755 13,743,603 Net cash used in operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used for operating activities was primarily due to higher study expense activity in the current period as compared to the prior year. 25 Table of Contents Net cash provided by investing activities . There was no net cash provided or consumed by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of approximately 2,800 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the sale of all remaining office furniture related to the Company s headquarters in the prior year. Net cash provided by financing activities . Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 99.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 14.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was due to higher net proceeds received from the August 8, 2024 and February 8, 2024 sales of common stock, pre-funded warrants, and warrants, compared to the February 3, 2023 sale of common stock and warrants and the exercise of warrants. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors that include, but are not limited to the following: the initiation, progress, timing and completion of clinical trials for our product candidates and potential product candidates; the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals and the regulatory approval process; delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements; the number of product candidates we pursue; the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims; the timing and terms of future collaboration, licensing, consulting or other arrangements that we may enter into; the cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities; the cost of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates; the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies; delays that may be caused by another outbreak of an infectious disease or other global societal disruptions; and the possible costs of litigation. Based on our working capital on September 30, 2024, including the approximately 92.3 million in net proceeds from the August 2024 Offering, we believe we have sufficient capital on hand to continue to fund operations through the end of 2027. 26 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Critical Accounting Policies contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Since our inception, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 27 Table of Contents Based on their evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in that they provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required by the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We routinely review our internal controls over financial reporting and from time to time make changes intended to enhance the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and will take action as appropriate. During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, management reviewed all work generated in support of the financial statements and corresponding footnotes in order to determine areas which may be susceptible to human error. The review focused on limiting manual inputs into work papers wherever possible and tying inputs to external source documents. In addition, management also enhanced its work paper review to compare figures to prior year amounts or source documents and increased the number of calculations in the work papers that are reviewed and re-performed. 28 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS There are no material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our property is subject. ITEM 1A.
