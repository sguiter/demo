 separate borrowing groups. The Manufacturing group consists of Textron consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the Textron Aviation, Bell, Textron Systems, Industrial and Textron eAviation segments. The Finance group, which also is the Finance segment, consists of Textron Financial Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. We designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our Finance group provides financial services. Due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group s activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group s performance. To support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the Consolidated Financial Statements. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated from the Consolidated Financial Statements, including retail financing activities for inventory sold by our Manufacturing group and financed by our Finance group. 
 Contract Estimates 
 For contracts where revenue is recognized over time, we recognize changes in estimated contract revenues, costs and profits using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. This method recognizes the cumulative effect of changes on current and prior periods with the impact of the change from inception-to-date recorded in the current period. Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable.

 Finance Receivable Portfolio Quality 
 We internally assess the quality of our finance receivables based on a number of key credit quality indicators and statistics such as delinquency, loan balance to estimated collateral value and the financial strength of individual borrowers and guarantors. Because many of these indicators are difficult to apply across an entire class of receivables, we evaluate individual loans on a quarterly basis and classify these loans into three categories based on the key credit quality indicators for the individual loan. These three categories are performing, watchlist and nonaccrual. 
 We classify finance receivables as nonaccrual if credit quality indicators suggest full collection of principal and interest is doubtful. In addition, we automatically classify accounts as nonaccrual once they are contractually delinquent by more than unless collection of principal and interest is not doubtful. Accounts are classified as watchlist when credit quality indicators have deteriorated as compared with typical underwriting criteria, and we believe collection of full principal and interest is probable but not certain. All other finance receivables that do not meet the watchlist or nonaccrual categories are classified as performing. 
 We measure delinquency based on the contractual payment terms of our finance receivables. In determining the delinquency aging category of an account, any/all principal and interest received is applied to the most past-due principal and/or interest amounts due. If a significant portion of the contractually due payment is delinquent, the entire finance receivable balance is reported in accordance with the most past-due delinquency aging category. 
 Watchlist Nonaccrual Nonaccrual as a percentage of finance receivables Current and less than 31 days past due 31-60 days past due 61-90 days past due Over 90 days past due 60+ days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables 
 At September 28, 2024, of our performing finance receivables were originated since the beginning of 2022 and were originated from 2019 to 2021 with the remainder prior to 2019. For finance receivables categorized as nonaccrual, were originated prior to 2021. 
 On a quarterly basis, we evaluate individual larger balance accounts for impairment. A finance receivable is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based on our review of the credit quality indicators described above. Impaired finance receivables include both nonaccrual accounts and accounts for which full collection of principal and interest remains probable, but the account s original terms have been, or are expected to be, significantly modified. If the modification specifies an interest rate equal to or greater than a market rate for a finance receivable with comparable risk, the account is not considered impaired in years subsequent to the modification.

 Operating lease expense totaled million and million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash paid for operating leases approximated the lease expense and is classified in cash flows from operating activities. Noncash transactions related to operating leases totaled million and million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, reflecting new or extended leases. In the first nine months of 2024, non-cash transactions included the recognition of a million asset and liability related to a new finance lease that matures in 2028.

million and million, respectively. At September 28, 2024, the fair value amounts of our foreign currency exchange contracts were a million asset and a million liability. At December 30, 2023, the fair value amount of our foreign currency exchange contracts were a million asset and a million liability. 
 Our Finance group enters into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate certain exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. By using these contracts, we are able to convert floating-rate cash flows to fixed-rate cash flows. These agreements are designated as cash flow hedges. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements is determined using values published by third-party leading financial news and data providers. These values are observable data that represent the value that financial institutions use for contracts entered into at that date, but are not based on actual transactions, so they are classified as Level 2. The fair value of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements was a million asset at September 28, 2024 and a million asset at December 30, 2023. 
 At September 28, 2024, we had interest rate swap agreements related to our Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes for an aggregate notional amount of million that effectively converts the variable-rate interest for these Notes to a weighted-average fixed rate of . These agreements have maturities ranging from August 2025 to August 2029. In the third quarter of 2024, we also entered into a new swap agreement related to these Notes with a notional amount of million and a weighted-average fixed rate of ; this agreement has a forward start date of August 15, 2025 and matures on August 15, 2030. At December 30, 2023, interest rate swap agreements related to these Notes had an aggregate notional amount of million with a weighted-average fixed rate of . At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that matures in June 2025 and effectively converts variable-rate interest on a term loan to a fixed rate of .

 Fair value for the Manufacturing group debt is determined using market observable data for similar transactions (Level 2). The fair value for the Finance group debt was determined primarily based on discounted cash flow analyses using observable market inputs from debt with similar duration, subordination and credit default expectations (Level 2). Fair value estimates for finance receivables were determined based on internally developed discounted cash flow models primarily utilizing significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which include estimates of the rate of return, financing cost, capital structure and/or discount rate expectations of current market participants combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses, payment rates and expectations of borrowers ability to make payments on a timely basis.

 million and charges of million, respectively, primarily related to headcount reductions at the Industrial, Textron Systems and Bell segments. In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a million reversal of accrued severance and related benefit costs due to a change in estimate as a result of retaining and re-assigning certain employees at Bell and due to customer contract termination cost reimbursements at Textron Systems. In the first nine months of 2024, special charges included million in severance costs and million in asset impairment charges; we recorded million of these charges at the Industrial segment, million at the Textron Systems segment and million at the Bell segment. We expect to incur additional special charges in the fourth quarter of 2024 in the range of approximately million to million, largely related to headcount reductions at the Industrial segment. 
 Since inception of the 2023 restructuring plan, we have incurred million in special charges, including severance costs of million, which included million at the Industrial segment, million at the Bell segment and million at the Textron Systems segment; and asset impairment charges of million at the Industrial segment. 
 Headcount reductions since inception of the plan are expected to total approximately positions, representing of our global workforce. We estimate that remaining future cash outlays under this plan will be in the range of million to million, most of which we expect to pay by the first quarter of 2025. We expect charges under this plan to be substantially completed by the end of 2024.

 Higher Bell revenues of 175 million, largely due to higher military volume of 81 million, primarily related to the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program that was partially offset by lower volume on the V-22 program, and higher commercial volume and mix of 67 million. 
 Textron Aviation revenues were essentially unchanged as higher pricing of 36 million was mostly offset by lower volume and mix of 35 million. 
 Lower Industrial revenues of 82 million, largely due to lower volume and mix of 86 million, principally in the Specialized Vehicles product line. 
 Lower Textron Systems revenues of 8 million, primarily due to lower volume. 
 
 Revenues increased 298 million, 3 , in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023. The revenue increase primarily included the following factors: 
 Higher Bell revenues of 374 million, largely due to higher military volume of 280 million, primarily related to the FLRAA program, partially offset by lower volume on the V-22 program. 
 Higher Textron Aviation revenues of 153 million, reflecting higher pricing of 141 million and higher volume and mix of 12 million. 
 Higher Textron Systems revenues of 9 million, primarily due to pricing. 
 Lower Industrial revenues of 234 million, largely due to lower volume and mix of 256 million, principally in the Specialized Vehicles product line. 
 Cost of Sales and Selling and Administrative Expense 
 Cost of sales includes cost of products and services sold for the Manufacturing group. Cost of sales increased 156 million, 6 , and 332 million, 4 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared with the corresponding periods of 2023. The increase in both periods included the impact from higher net volume and mix of 91 million and 195 million, respectively, and inflation of 57 million and 173 million, respectively. Gross margin as a percentage of Manufacturing revenues decreased 240 basis points in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower margins at the Textron Aviation segment, at the Industrial segment, largely in the Specialized Vehicles product line, and at the Bell segment. Gross margin as a percentage of Manufacturing revenues decreased 80 basis points in the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to lower margins at the Industrial segment, largely in the Specialized Vehicles product line, and at the Bell segment. 
 Selling and administrative expense decreased 21 million, 7 , and 6 million, 1 , in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding periods of 2023, respectively. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 includes lower share-based compensation expense, partially offset by a 17 million recovery of credit losses in the third quarter of 2023 at the Finance segment.

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense, net includes interest expense for both the Finance and Manufacturing borrowing groups, with interest on intercompany borrowings eliminated, and interest income earned on cash and equivalents for the Manufacturing borrowing group. 
 In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, interest expense, net increased 7 million, 37 , and 13 million, 22 , respectively, compared with the corresponding periods of 2023, primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average interest rate of our debt. Gross interest expense totaled 36 million and 110 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and 32 million and 95 million, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. 
 Special Charges 
 Special charges include restructuring activities and asset impairment charges as described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 11.5 and 10.6 , respectively. In the third quarter of 2024, the effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , largely due to the favorable impact of research and development credits and foreign tax credits. In the third quarter of 2023, the effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 , largely due to the favorable impact of research and development credits and tax deductions for foreign-derived intangible income. 
 Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 15.8 and 15.6 , respectively, and was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate largely due to the favorable impact of research and development credits and tax deductions for foreign-derived intangible income. 
 Backlog 
 Our backlog is summarized below: 
 (In millions) September 28, 2024 December 30, 2023 Textron Aviation 7,626 7,169 Bell 6,500 4,780 Textron Systems 1,867 1,950 Total backlog 15,993 13,899 
 Bell's backlog increased 1.7 billion, 36 , due to orders in excess of revenues recognized and deliveries. In August 2024, the U.S. Army announced the approval of Milestone B for the FLRAA program, establishing it as a program of record and transitioning it to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase. As a result, in the third quarter, Bell was awarded a 2.5 billion contract for this phase of the program. 
 
 Segment Analysis 
 We operate in, and report financial information for, the following six operating segments: Textron Aviation, Bell, Textron Systems, Industrial, Textron eAviation and Finance. Segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. Segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes the non-service components of pension and postretirement income, net; LIFO inventory provision; intangible asset amortization; interest expense, net for Manufacturing group; certain corporate expenses; gains/losses on major business dispositions; and special charges. The measurement for the Finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense. Operating expenses for the manufacturing segments include cost of sales and selling and administrative expense, while excluding certain corporate expenses, LIFO inventory provision, intangible asset amortization and special charges. 
 In our discussion of comparative results for the Manufacturing group, changes in revenues and segment profit for our commercial businesses typically are expressed in terms of volume and mix, pricing, foreign exchange, acquisitions and dispositions, inflation and performance. For revenues, volume and mix represents changes in revenues from increases or decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided and the composition of products and/or services sold. For segment profit, volume and mix represents a change due to the number of units delivered or services provided and the composition of products and/or services sold at different profit margins. Pricing represents changes in unit pricing. Foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign-denominated amounts into U.S. dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period. Revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in Acquisitions for a twelve-month period, while reductions in revenues and segment profit from the sale of businesses are reflected as Dispositions. Inflation represents higher material, wages, benefits, pension service cost or other costs. Performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development, depreciation, selling and administrative costs, warranty, product liability, quality/scrap, labor efficiency, overhead, product line profitability, start-up, ramp up and cost-reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs.

Table of Contents 

Approximately 21 of our 2023 revenues were derived from contracts with the U.S. Government, including those under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program. For our segments that contract with the U.S. Government, changes in revenues related to these contracts are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in segment profit for these contracts are typically expressed in terms of volume and mix and performance; these include cumulative catch-up adjustments associated with a) revisions to the transaction price that may reflect contract modifications or changes in assumptions related to award fees and other variable consideration or b) changes in the total estimated costs at completion due to improved or deteriorated operating performance.

 On September 21, 2024, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District 70, Local Lodge 774 called a strike against Textron Aviation and rejected a new proposed four-year contract. The strike impacted approximately 5,000 of Textron Aviation s employees at the manufacturing, parts and distribution and service center facilities in Wichita. On October 20, 2024, Textron Aviation and the IAM reached an agreement and a new five-year labor contract was ratified. 
 While Textron Aviation had implemented its continuity of operations plans to help mitigate the impact of the labor disruption, the strike has had, and continues to have, an adverse impact on Textron Aviation s ability to meet its production and delivery schedules. In the third quarter of 2024, delayed aircraft deliveries along with unfavorable performance from manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the labor disruption resulting from the strike lowered revenues by approximately 50 million and segment profit by approximately 30 million. We expect revenue and segment profit to be unfavorably impacted in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to the labor disruption and the recovery of production and delivery activities as our employees return to work. 
 Textron Aviation Revenues and Operating Expenses 
 The following factors contributed to the change in Textron Aviation s revenues for the periods: 
 (In millions) Q3 2024 versus Q3 2023 YTD 2024 versus YTD 2023 Pricing 36 141 Volume and mix (35) 12 Total change 1 153 
 Textron Aviation s revenues were essentially unchanged in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, as higher pricing of 36 million was mostly offset by lower volume and mix of 35 million. The lower volume and mix was primarily due to lower commercial turboprop volume, partially offset by higher aftermarket, defense and Citation jet volume. We delivered 41 Citation jets and 25 commercial turboprops in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 39 Citation jets and 38 commercial turboprops in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Textron Aviation s revenues increased 153 million, 4 , in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, reflecting higher pricing of 141 million and higher volume and mix of 12 million. The increase in volume and mix includes higher aftermarket volume and a favorable mix of Citation jets, partially offset by lower defense and commercial turboprop volume. We delivered 119 Citation jets and 89 commercial turboprops in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 118 Citation jets and 109 commercial turboprops in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Textron Aviation s operating expenses increased 33 million, 3 , and 143 million, 4 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, compared with the corresponding periods of 2023, largely due to inflation of 36 million and 105 million, respectively. The increase in the third quarter of 2024 was partially offset by the lower volume and mix described above.

The following table reflects information about the Finance segment s credit performance related to finance receivables. 
 (Dollars in millions) September 28, 2024 December 30, 2023 Finance receivables 614 609 Allowance for credit losses 19 24 Ratio of allowance for credit losses to finance receivables 3.09 3.94 Nonaccrual finance receivables 11 15 Ratio of nonaccrual finance receivables to finance receivables 1.79 2.46 60+ days contractual delinquency 4 60+ days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables 0.00 0.66 
 We believe our allowance for credit losses adequately covers our exposure on these loans as our estimated collateral values largely exceed the outstanding loan amounts. Key portfolio quality indicators are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups. The Manufacturing group consists of Textron consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the Textron Aviation, Bell, Textron Systems, Industrial and Textron eAviation segments. The Finance group, which also is the Finance segment, consists of Textron Financial Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. We designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our Finance group provides financial services. Due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group s activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group s performance. To support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below: 
 (Dollars in millions) September 28, 2024 December 30, 2023 Manufacturing group Cash and equivalents 1,289 2,121 Debt 3,241 3,526 Shareholders equity 6,951 6,987 Capital (debt plus shareholders equity) 10,192 10,513 Net debt (net of cash and equivalents) to capital 22 17 Debt to capital 32 34 Finance group Cash and equivalents 58 60 Debt 341 348 
 We believe that our calculations of debt to capital and net debt to capital are useful measures as they provide a summary indication of the level of debt financing (i.e., leverage) that is in place to support our capital structure, as well as to provide an indication of the capacity to add further leverage. We expect to have sufficient cash to meet our needs based on our existing cash balances, the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and the availability of our existing credit facility. 
 Credit Facilities and Other Sources of Capital 
 Textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of 1.0 billion, of which 100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. We may elect to increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility to up to 1.3 billion by designating an additional lender or by an existing lender agreeing to increase its commitment. The facility expires in October 2027 and provides for two one-year extensions at our option with the consent of lenders representing a majority of the commitments under the facility. At September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were 9 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility. 
 We also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities. On March 1, 2024, we repaid our 350 million 4.30 Notes due March 2024.

Manufacturing Group Cash Flows 
 Cash flows for the Manufacturing group as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized below: 
 Nine Months Ended (In millions) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Operating activities 561 737 Investing activities (194) (182) Financing activities (1,199) (841) 
 In the first nine months of 2024, cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations decreased by 176 million to 561 million, compared with 737 million in the first nine months of 2023, largely due to changes in working capital, partially offset by 69 million in lower net tax payments. 
 Due to the employee strike at the Textron Aviation segment, as discussed on page 22 in the Segment Analysis section, our cash flows from operating activities were adversely impacted by lower deliveries in the third quarter. We expect that operating cash flow will continue to be unfavorably impacted related to the labor disruption and the recovery of production and delivery activities as our employees return to work. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities included 211 million and 224 million of capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, partially offset by 27 million and 39 million of net proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance policies, respectively. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 included 890 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 10.1 million shares of our common stock and 360 million of payments on long-term debt. In the first nine months of 2023, cash flows used in financing activities included 885 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 12.5 million shares of our common stock.

 The Finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned Textron Aviation aircraft and Bell helicopters manufactured by our Manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties. However, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group. For example, when product is sold by our Manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the Finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the Finance group s statement of cash flows. Meanwhile, in the Manufacturing group s statement of cash flows, the cash received from the Finance group on the customer s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow. Although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing. These captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Reclassification adjustments included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized below: 
 Nine Months Ended (In millions) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Reclassification adjustments from investing activities to operating activities: Cash received from customers 76 90 Finance receivable originations for Manufacturing group inventory sales (72) (122) Total reclassification adjustments from investing activities to operating activities 4 (32) 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates Update 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. The accounting estimates that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are reported in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. The following section provides an update of the year-end disclosure. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 A substantial portion of our revenues is related to long-term contracts with the U.S. Government, including those under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program, for the design, development, manufacture or modification of aerospace and defense products as well as related services. We generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for these contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. 
 Changes in our estimate of the total expected cost or in the transaction price for a contract typically impact our profit booking rate. We utilize the cumulative catch-up method of accounting to recognize the impact of these changes on our profit booking rate for a contract. Under this method, the inception-to-date impact of a profit adjustment on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. The impact of our cumulative catch-up adjustments on segment profit recognized in prior periods is presented below: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (In millions) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Gross favorable 23 29 95 78 Gross unfavorable (13) (11) (54) (42) Net adjustments 10 18 41 36
