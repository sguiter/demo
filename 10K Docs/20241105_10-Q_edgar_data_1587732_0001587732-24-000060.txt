former MGP sites in Kansas. These sites contain contaminants generally associated with MGP sites and are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the KDHE governs all environmental investigation and remediation work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement require us to investigate these sites and set remediation activities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. Remediation typically involves the management of contaminated soils and may involve removal of structures and monitoring and/or remediation of groundwater. We have completed or are addressing removal of the source of soil contamination at all sites and continue to monitor groundwater at of the sites according to plans approved by the KDHE. Regulatory closure has been achieved at of the sites, but these sites remain subject to potential future requirements that may result in additional costs. 
 
 We have an AAO that allows Kansas Gas Service to defer and seek recovery of costs necessary for investigation and remediation at, and nearby, these former MGP sites that are incurred after January 1, 2017, up to a cap of million, net of any related insurance recoveries. Costs approved for recovery in a future rate proceeding would then be amortized over a 15-

 million, net of any related insurance recoveries, Kansas Gas Service will be required to file an application with the KCC for approval to increase the million cap. In January 2024, we received million in insurance proceeds for remediation costs related to these sites. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have deferred million and million, respectively, for accrued investigation and remediation costs pursuant to our AAO. Kansas Gas Service expects to file an application in the first quarter of 2025 for amounts deferred in excess of the cap. 
 
 We also own or retain legal responsibility for certain environmental conditions at a former MGP site in Texas. At the request of the TCEQ, we began investigating the level and extent of contamination associated with the site under their Texas Risk Reduction Program. A preliminary site investigation revealed that this site contains contaminants generally associated with MGP sites and is subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. At September 30, 2024, estimated costs associated with expected remediation activities for this site are not material. 
 
 Our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effects on earnings or cash flows during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The reserve for remediation of our MGP sites was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report, as well as our Annual Report. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a 12-month period. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 Credit Facility - In October 2024, we entered into an agreement that increased the capacity of the ONE Gas Credit Agreement to 1.35 billion from 1.275 billion with commitments from existing lenders and the addition of a new lender. The maturity date March 16, 2028, remains unchanged. 
 
 Commercial Paper - In October 2024, we increased the capacity of our commercial paper program to 1.35 billion from 1.275 billion. 
 
 Senior Notes - In August 2024, we reopened our outstanding 5.10 percent senior notes due 2029 and issued an additional 250 million. After the completion of this offering, the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5.10 percent senior notes due 2029 is 550 million. 
 
 We repaid our 300 million of 3.61 percent senior notes due February 2024 and our 473 million of 1.10 percent senior notes due March 2024 upon maturity with commercial paper. 

Dividend - In November 2024, we declared a dividend of 0.66 per share 2.64 per share on an annualized basis) for shareholders of record as of November 19, 2024, payable on December 4, 2024. 

REGULATORY ACTIVITIES 

Oklahoma - As required by our tariff, PBRC filings are made annually on or before March 15 until the next general rate case, which is required to be filed on or before June 30, 2027. On February 29, 2024, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed its required PBRC application for the year ended December 2023. The filed request included a 31.8 million base rate revenue increase, 2.4 million energy efficiency incentive, and 12.8 million of estimated EDIT to be credited to customers in 2025. On May 31, 2024, a settlement in the case was filed with a proposed revenue increase of 31.4 million. On June 4, 2024, a hearing was held at the conclusion of which the administrative law judge took the case under advisement. On July 15, 2024, the administrative law judge issued a report to the OCC recommending approval of the settlement agreement. Pursuant to its tariff, Oklahoma Natural Gas placed new rates into effect on June 28, 2024. The OCC issued an order approving the settlement on August 27, 2024. 

Kansas - On March 1, 2024, Kansas Gas Service submitted an application to the KCC requesting an increase to its base rates reflecting investments in its natural gas distribution system, implementation of a performance-based ratemaking mechanism and residential rate design options that align with customer usage. On August 2, 2024, a unanimous settlement agreement was signed by all parties to the rate case and filed with the KCC. A hearing on the unanimous settlement agreement was held on August 13, 2024. On October 3, 2024, the KCC issued an order approving the settlement agreement and new rates became effective on November 1, 2024. Kansas Gas Service s net base rates will increase by 35 million. Kansas Gas Service was already recovering 35 million from customers through the GSRS; therefore, this settlement represents a total base rate increase of 70 million. The unanimous settlement agreement stipulates a GSRS pre-tax carrying charge of 8.97 percent for subsequent GSRS filings. 

Texas - West-North Service Area - In March 2024, Texas Gas Service made a GRIP filing for all customers in the West-North service area, requesting an 8.6 million increase to be effective in July 2024. In June of 2024, El Paso and Socorro denied the requested increase. Texas Gas Service filed an appeal of these denials to the RRC on July 8, 2024, which was upheld by the RRC. All other municipalities, and the RRC, approved an increase of 8.5 million or allowed it to take effect with no action. Texas Gas Service implemented new rates in July 2024. 

Central-Gulf Service Area - In February 2024, Texas Gas Service made a GRIP filing for all customers in the Central-Gulf service area, requesting a 12.3 million increase to be effective in June 2024. In May 2024, the RRC and municipalities approved an increase of 12.2 million, and new rates became effective in June 2024.

 In June 2024, Texas Gas Service filed a rate case for all customers in the Central-Gulf service area, requesting a 25.8 million increase. Texas Gas Service has invested approximately 355 million in its Central-Gulf service area natural gas distribution system since its last Central-Gulf service area rate case was finalized in August 2020. A portion of this investment, approximately 342 million, is currently recovered through GRIP. On September 27, 2024, the parties filed an uncontested settlement agreement for an increase of 19.3 million based on a 9.7 percent return on equity and 59.6 percent common equity ratio. In October 2024, the administrative law judge issued a proposal for decision recommending the settlement be approved. If the settlement is approved by the RRC, new rates will take effect in December 2024. 

Rio Grande Valley Service Area - In May 2024, Texas Gas Service made a GRIP filing for all customers in the Rio Grande Valley service area, requesting a 3.7 million increase to be effective in August 2024. In August 2024, the RRC and municipalities approved an increase of 3.6 million, and new rates became effective in September 2024.

 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATING INFORMATION 

We operate in one reportable business segment: regulated public utilities that deliver natural gas to residential, commercial and transportation customers. Our accounting policies are the same as described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report. We evaluate our financial performance principally on net income. 

Selected Financial Results - For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 19.2 million, or 0.34 per diluted share, compared with 25.2 million, or 0.45 per diluted share, in the same period last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 145.8 million, or 2.56 per diluted share, compared with 160.5 million, or 2.87 per diluted share, in the same period last year. 

The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for our operations for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Three Months Nine Months September 30, September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 2024 vs. 2023

Natural gas sales to customers represent revenue from contracts with customers through implied contracts established by our tariffs and rates approved by regulatory authorities, as well as revenues from regulatory mechanisms related to natural gas sales. Additionally, natural gas sales include recovery of the cost of natural gas. 
 
 Our natural gas sales include fixed and variable charges related to the delivery of natural gas and gas costs that are passed through to our customers in accordance with our cost of natural gas regulatory mechanisms. Fixed charges reflect the portion of our natural gas sales attributable to the monthly fixed customer charge component of our rates, which does not fluctuate based on customer usage in each period. Variable charges reflect the portion of our natural gas sales that fluctuate with the volumes delivered and billed and the effects of weather normalization. 
 
 Transportation revenues represent revenue from contracts with customers through implied contracts established by our tariffs and rates approved by regulatory authorities, as well as tariff-based negotiated contracts. 
 
 Securitization customer charges represent revenue from contracts with customers through implied contracts established by the financing order approved by the KCC, related to the securitization of extraordinary costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri in the state of Kansas. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for additional discussion of the securitization transaction in Kansas. 

Other revenues include primarily miscellaneous service charges, which represent implied contracts with customers established by our tariffs and rates approved by regulatory authorities and other revenues from regulatory mechanisms. 
 
 Cost of natural gas includes commodity purchases, fuel, storage, transportation, hedging costs and settlement proceeds for natural gas price volatility mitigation programs approved by our regulators and other gas purchase costs recovered through our cost of natural gas regulatory mechanisms and does not include an allocation of general operating costs or depreciation and amortization. These regulatory mechanisms provide a method of recovering natural gas costs on an ongoing basis without a profit. Therefore, although our revenues will fluctuate with the cost of natural gas that we pass-through to our customers, operating income is not affected by fluctuations in the cost of natural gas.

 Operating income increased 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period last year, due primarily to an increase of 17.5 million from new rates. 
 
 The increase was offset partially by: 
 
 an increase of 3.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense from additional capital investment; 
 an increase of 6.1 million in employee-related costs; and 
 an increase of 2.0 million in outside services. 
 
 Operating income increased 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period last year, due primarily to the following: 
 
 an increase of 43.3 million from new rates; and 
 an increase of 5.1 million in residential sales due primarily to net customer growth in Oklahoma and Texas. 
 
 These increases were offset by: 
 
 an increase of 16.5 million of employee-related costs; 
 an increase of 14.0 million in depreciation and amortization expense from additional capital investment; 
 an increase of 2.1 million due to ad valorem taxes; 
 an increase of 1.0 million due to insurance expense; 
 an increase of 1.9 million in fleet costs; and 
 a decrease of 5.9 million due to lower sales volumes, largely offset by the impact of weather normalization mechanisms. 

Other Factors Affecting Net Income - Other factors that affected net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, include an increase of 2.9 million in other income/(expense), net due primarily to a 3.4 million increase in the market value of investments associated with our nonqualified employee benefit plans. 
 
 Other factors that affected net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period last year, include an increase of 2.5 million in other income/(expense), net, due primarily to a 3.2 million increase in the market value of investments associated with our nonqualified employee benefit plans. 
 
 Additionally, net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes an increase in interest expense of 11.2 million and 21.9 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense is due primarily to the issuance of 300 million of 5.10 percent senior notes in December 2023 and the repayment of 300 million of 3.61 percent senior notes due February 2024 and 473 million of 1.10 percent senior notes due March 2024 upon maturity with commercial paper. 

EDIT - Income tax expense reflects credits for the amortization of the regulatory liability associated with EDIT that was returned to customers of 1.5 million and 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 13.4 million and 15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Capital Expenditures and Asset Removal Costs - Our capital expenditures program includes expenditures for pipeline integrity, extending service to new areas, reinforcing and increasing system capabilities, pipeline replacements, automated meter reading, government-mandated pipeline relocations, fleet, facilities, IT assets, and cybersecurity. It is our practice to maintain and upgrade our infrastructure, facilities and systems to ensure safe, reliable, and efficient operations. Asset removal costs include expenditures associated with the replacement or retirement of long-lived assets that result from the construction, development and/or normal use of our assets, primarily our pipeline assets. 

Capital expenditures and asset removal costs were 13.4 million and 32.6 million higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the same period last year, due primarily to expenditures for system integrity and extension of service to new areas. Our full-year capital expenditures and asset removal costs are expected to be approximately 750 million for 2024.

The increase in the average number of customers for the periods presented is due primarily to the connection of new customers resulting from the extension and expansion of our system in our service areas. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our average customer count includes approximately 5,500 new customer connections during the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our average customer count includes approximately 16,000 new customer connections during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our average customer count included approximately 23,400 new customer connections. 

The following table reflects total volumes delivered, excluding the effects of WNA mechanisms on sales volumes:

 Normal HDDs are established through rate proceedings in each of our jurisdictions for use primarily in weather normalization billing calculations. See further discussion on weather normalization in our Regulatory Overview section in Part 1, Item 1, Business, of our Annual Report. Normal HDDs disclosed above are based on: 
 
 Oklahoma - A 10-year weighted average as of June 30, 2021, as calculated using 11 weather stations across Oklahoma and weighted on average customer count. 
 Kansas - A 30-year rolling average for years 1988-2017 calculated using three weather stations across Kansas and weighted on HDDs by weather station and customers. 
 Texas - An average of HDDs authorized in our most recent rate proceeding in each jurisdiction and weighted using a rolling 10-year average of actual natural gas distribution sales volumes by service area. 
 
 Actual HDDs are based on the quarter-to-date weighted average of: 
 
 11 weather stations and customers by month for Oklahoma; 
 3 weather stations and customers by month for Kansas; and 
 9 weather stations and natural gas distribution sales volumes by service area for Texas. 

CONTINGENCIES 

We are a party to various litigation matters and claims that have arisen in the normal course of our operations. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the reasonably possible losses from such matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not material. Additionally, we believe the probable outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 General - We have relied primarily on operating cash flow and commercial paper for our liquidity and capital resource requirements. We fund operating expenses, working capital requirements, including purchases of natural gas, and capital expenditures primarily with cash from operations and commercial paper. 
 
 Our stable cash flow and earnings profile is due to the significant residential component of our customer base, the fixed-charge component of our natural gas sales revenues and the rate mechanisms that we have in place. Additionally, we have rate mechanisms in place in our jurisdictions that reduce the lag in earning a return on our capital expenditures and provide for recovery of certain changes in our cost of service by allowing for adjustments to rates between rate cases. We anticipate that our cash flow generated from operations and our expected short- and long-term financing arrangements will enable us to maintain our current and planned level of operations and provide us flexibility to finance our infrastructure investments. Our ability to 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 access capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on market conditions, our financial condition and credit ratings. 
 
 Short-term Debt - In October 2024, we entered into an agreement that increased the capacity of the ONE Gas Credit Agreement to 1.35 billion from 1.275 billion with commitments from existing lenders and the addition of a new lender. The ONE Gas Credit Agreement provides for a 1.35 billion revolving unsecured credit facility and includes a 20 million letter of credit subfacility and a 60 million swingline subfacility. We can request an increase in commitments of up to an additional 150 million upon satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of commitments from either new lenders or increased commitments from existing lenders. The ONE Gas Credit Agreement is available to provide liquidity for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and mergers, the issuance of letters of credit, and for other general corporate purposes. 
 
 The ONE Gas Credit Agreement contains certain financial, operational and legal covenants. Among other things, these covenants include maintaining ONE Gas total debt-to-capital ratio of no more than 70 percent at the end of any calendar quarter. At September 30, 2024, our total debt-to-capital ratio was 54.5 percent and we were in compliance with all covenants under the ONE Gas Credit Agreement. Excluding the debt of KGSS-I, which is non-recourse to us, our total debt-to-capital ratio was 52.3 percent. We may reduce the unutilized portion of the ONE Gas Credit Agreement in whole or in part without premium or penalty. The ONE Gas Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the obligations under the ONE Gas Credit Agreement may be accelerated and the commitments may be terminated. 
 
 In October 2024, we increased the capacity of our commercial paper program to 1.35 billion from 1.275 billion. Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper to fund short-term borrowing needs. The maturities of the commercial paper vary but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. Commercial paper is generally sold at par less a discount representing an interest factor. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 951.4 million and 88.5 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.24 percent and 5.60 percent, respectively. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 1.4 million in letters of credit issued and no borrowings under the ONE Gas Credit Agreement, with approximately 1.275 billion of remaining credit, which is available to repay our commercial paper borrowings. 
 
 Senior Notes - We repaid our 300 million of 3.61 percent senior notes due February 2024 and our 473 million of 1.10 percent senior notes due March 2024 upon maturity with commercial paper. 
 
 In August, 2024, we reopened our outstanding 5.10 percent senior notes due 2029 and issued an additional 250 million. After the completion of this offering, the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5.10 percent senior notes due 2029 is 550 million. The additional 250 million senior notes were issued at a premium of 4 million, creating an effective interest rate of 4.87 percent. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 2.2 billion of Senior Notes with none due within the next year. The indenture governing our Senior Notes includes an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of 100 million or more. Such events of default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes to declare those Senior Notes immediately due and payable in full. 
 
 Depending on the series, we may redeem our Senior Notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, starting one month, three months or six months before their maturity dates. Prior to these dates, we may redeem these Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium. The redemption price will never be less than 100 percent of the principal amount of the respective Senior Note plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Our Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our long-term debt-to-capital ratio was 46 percent. Excluding the debt of KGSS-I, which is non-recourse to us, our long-term debt-to-capital ratio was 43 percent. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for information with respect to KGSS-I.

We intend to maintain credit metrics at a level that supports our balanced approach to capital investment and a return of capital to shareholders via a dividend that we believe will be competitive with our peer group. 
 
 Securitized Utility Tariff Bonds - At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 287.3 million of 5.486 percent KGSS-I Securitized Utility Tariff Bonds with 29.0 million due within the next year. The bonds are governed by an indenture between KGSS-I and the indenture trustee. The indenture contains certain covenants that restrict KGSS-I s ability to sell, transfer, convey, exchange, or otherwise dispose of its assets.

Pension and Other Postemployment Benefit Plans - In 2024, our contributions are expected to be approximately 1.4 million to our defined benefit pension plans, and no contributions are expected to be made to our other postemployment benefit plans. We use a December 31 measurement date for our plans. 
 
 Information about our pension and other postemployment benefit plans, including anticipated contributions, is included under Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for additional information. 

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS 
 
 We use the indirect method to prepare our consolidated statements of cash flows. Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments and changes in our assets and liabilities not classified as investing or financing activities during the period. Items that impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments include, but are not limited to, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, share-based compensation expense and provision for doubtful accounts.

Table of Contents 

 The following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Variance 2024 2023 2024 vs. 2023 
 Millions of dollars 
 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 305.8 842.5 (536.7) Investing activities (522.2) (489.4) (32.8) Financing activities 205.8 (353.2) 559.0 Change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents (10.6) (0.1) (10.5) Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents at beginning of period 39.4 18.1 21.3 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents at end of period 28.8 18.0 10.8 
 
 Operating Cash Flows - Changes in cash flows from operating activities are due primarily to changes in sales revenues, natural gas costs and operating expenses discussed in Financial Results and Operating Information, the effects of Winter Storm Uri discussed in Regulatory Activities and changes in working capital. Changes in natural gas prices and demand for our services or natural gas, whether because of general economic conditions, variations in weather not mitigated by WNA mechanisms, changes in supply or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows. Typically, our cash flows from operations are greater in the first half of the year compared with the second half of the year. 
 
 Operating cash flows were lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior period, due primarily to proceeds from government securitization of winter weather costs for Texas Gas Service in March 2023 and working capital changes related to lower cost of gas rates embedded in accounts receivable and natural gas in storage. 
 
 Investing Cash Flows - Cash used in investing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior period, due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures for system integrity and extension of service to new areas. 
 
 Financing Cash Flows - Cash used in financing activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior period, due primarily to commercial paper borrowing in excess of repayments of long-term debt and the additional issuance of long-term debt. 

ENVIRONMENTAL, SAFETY AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

Environmental Matters - We are subject to multiple laws and regulations regarding protection of the environment and natural and cultural resources, which affect many aspects of our present and future operations. Regulated activities include, but are not limited to, those involving air emissions, storm water and wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, wetland preservation, plant and wildlife protection, hazardous materials use, storage and transportation, and pipeline and facility construction. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and/or comply with a wide variety of environmental clearances, registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, licenses and permits or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may expose us to fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could be material to our results of operations. In addition, emission controls and/or other regulatory or permitting mandates under the CAA and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures. We cannot assure that existing environmental statutes and regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional statutes or regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our expenditures for environmental investigation and remediation compliance to-date have not been significant in relation to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effects on earnings or cash flows during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 We own or retain legal responsibility for certain environmental conditions at 12 former MGP sites in Kansas. These sites contain contaminants generally associated with MGP sites and are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the KDHE governs all environmental investigation and remediation work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement require us to investigate these sites and set remediation 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 activities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. Remediation typically involves the management of contaminated soils and may involve removal of structures and monitoring and/or remediation of groundwater. We have completed or are addressing removal of the source of soil contamination at all 12 sites and continue to monitor groundwater at seven of the 12 sites according to plans approved by the KDHE. Regulatory closure has been achieved at five of the 12 sites, but these sites remain subject to potential future requirements that may result in additional costs. 
 
 We have an AAO that allows Kansas Gas Service to defer and seek recovery of costs necessary for investigation and remediation at, and nearby, these 12 former MGP sites that are incurred after January 1, 2017, up to a cap of 15.0 million, net of any related insurance recoveries. Costs approved for recovery in a future rate proceeding would then be amortized over a 15-year period. The unamortized amounts will not be included in rate base or accumulate carrying charges. Following a determination that future investigation and remediation work approved by the KDHE exceeds 15.0 million, net of any related insurance recoveries, Kansas Gas Service will be required to file an application with the KCC for approval to increase the 15.0 million cap. In January 2024, we received 1.5 million in insurance proceeds for remediation costs related to these sites. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have deferred 30.4 million and 32.0 million, respectively, for accrued investigation and remediation costs pursuant to our AAO. Kansas Gas Service expects to file an application in the first quarter of 2025 for amounts deferred in excess of the cap. 
 
 We also own or retain legal responsibility for certain environmental conditions at a former MGP site in Texas. At the request of the TCEQ, we began investigating the level and extent of contamination associated with the site under their Texas Risk Reduction Program. A preliminary site investigation revealed that this site contains contaminants generally associated with MGP sites and is subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. At September 30, 2024, estimated costs associated with expected remediation activities for this site are not material. 
 
 Our expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effects on earnings or cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The reserve for remediation of our MGP sites was 13.6 million and 14.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Environmental Footprint - We cannot assure that existing environmental statutes and regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our expenditures for environmental investigation, and remediation compliance to-date have not been significant in relation to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effects on earnings or cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Pipeline Safety - We are subject to regulation under federal pipeline safety statutes and any analogous state regulations. These include safety requirements for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of pipelines, including transmission and distribution pipelines. At the federal level, we are regulated by PHMSA. PHMSA regulations require the following for certain pipelines: inspection and maintenance plans; integrity management programs, including the determination of pipeline integrity risks and periodic assessments on certain pipeline segments; an operator qualification program, which includes certain trainings; a public awareness program that provides certain information; and a control room management plan. 
 
 As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, the PIPES Act reauthorized PHMSA through 2023 and directed the agency to move forward with several regulatory actions, including the Pipeline Safety: Class Location Change Requirements and the Pipeline Safety: Safety of Gas Transmission and Gathering Pipelines proposed rulemakings. Congress has also instructed PHMSA to issue final regulations that will require operators of non-rural gas gathering lines and new and existing transmission and distribution pipeline facilities to conduct certain leak detection and repair programs and to require facility inspection and maintenance plans to align with those regulations. To the extent such rulemakings impose more stringent requirements on our facilities, we may be required to incur expenditures that may be material. 

Regulatory - Several regulatory initiatives impacted the earnings and future earnings potential of our business. See additional information regarding our regulatory initiatives in the Regulatory Activities section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 
 Information about the impact of new accounting standards, if any, is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report.

Table of Contents 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates. 

Information about our estimates and critical accounting policies is included under Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Estimates and Accounting Policies, in our Annual Report. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Some of the statements contained and incorporated in this Quarterly Report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The forward-looking statements relate to our anticipated financial performance, liquidity, management s plans and objectives for our future operations, our business prospects, the outcome of regulatory and legal proceedings, market conditions and other matters. We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following discussion is intended to identify important factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 Forward-looking and other statements in this Quarterly Report regarding our environmental, social and other sustainability plans and goals are not an indication that these statements are necessarily material to investors or required to be disclosed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental, social and sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. 
 
 Forward-looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, the information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations and other statements contained or incorporated in this Quarterly Report identified by words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe, should, goal, forecast, guidance, could, may, continue, might, potential, scheduled, likely, and other words and terms of similar meaning. 
 
 One should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which are applicable only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Those factors may affect our operations, costs, liquidity, markets, products, services and prices. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with the forward-looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statement include, among others, the following: 
 
 our ability to recover costs, income taxes and amounts equivalent to the cost of property, plant and equipment, regulatory assets and our allowed rate of return in our regulated rates or other recovery mechanisms; 
 cyber-attacks, which, according to experts, continue to increase in volume and sophistication, or breaches of technology systems that could disrupt our operations or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee, vendor, counterparty or Company information; further, increased remote working arrangements have required enhancements and modifications to our IT infrastructure (e.g. Internet, Virtual Private Network, remote collaboration systems, etc.), and any failures of the technologies, including third-party service providers, that facilitate working remotely could limit our ability to conduct ordinary operations or expose us to increased risk or effect of an attack; 
 our ability to manage our operations and maintenance costs; 
 changes in regulation of natural gas distribution services, particularly those in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas; 
 the economic climate and, particularly, its effect on the natural gas requirements of our residential and commercial customers; 
 the length and severity of a pandemic or other health crisis which could significantly disrupt or prevent us from operating our business in the ordinary course for an extended period; 
 competition from alternative forms of energy, including, but not limited to, electricity, solar power, wind power, geothermal energy and biofuels;

 adverse weather conditions and variations in weather, including seasonal effects on demand and/or supply, the occurrence of severe storms in the territories in which we operate, and climate change, and the related effects on supply, demand, and costs; 
 indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limit our ability to borrow additional funds and/or place us at competitive disadvantage compared with competitors; 
 our ability to secure reliable, competitively priced and flexible natural gas transportation and supply, including decisions by natural gas producers to reduce production or shut-in producing natural gas wells and expiration of existing supply and transportation and storage arrangements that are not replaced with contracts with similar terms and pricing; 
 our ability to complete necessary or desirable expansion or infrastructure development projects, which may delay or prevent us from serving our customers or expanding our business; 
 operational and mechanical hazards or interruptions; 
 adverse labor relations; 
 the effectiveness of our strategies to reduce earnings lag, revenue protection strategies and risk mitigation strategies, which may be affected by risks beyond our control such as commodity price volatility, counterparty performance or creditworthiness and interest rate risk; 
 the capital-intensive nature of our business, and the availability of and access to, in general, funds to meet our debt obligations prior to or when they become due and to fund our operations and capital expenditures, either through (i) cash on hand, (ii) operating cash flow, or (iii) access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity; 
 our ability to obtain capital on commercially reasonable terms, or on terms acceptable to us, or at all; 
 limitations on our operating flexibility, earnings and cash flows due to restrictions in our financing arrangements; 
 cross-default provisions in our borrowing arrangements, which may lead to our inability to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations in the event of a default on our part; 
 changes in the financial markets during the periods covered by the forward-looking statements, particularly those affecting the availability of capital and our ability to refinance existing debt and fund investments and acquisitions to execute our business strategy; 
 actions of rating agencies, including the ratings of debt, general corporate ratings and changes in the rating agencies ratings criteria; 
 changes in inflation and interest rates; 
 our ability to recover the costs of natural gas purchased for our customers and any related financing required to support our purchase of natural gas supply; 
 impact of potential impairment charges;

 possible loss of LDC franchises or other adverse effects caused by the actions of municipalities; 
 payment and performance by counterparties and customers as contracted and when due, including our counterparties maintaining ordinary course terms of supply and payments; 
 changes in existing or the addition of new environmental, safety, tax, cybersecurity and other laws or regulations to which we and our subsidiaries are subject, including those that may require significant expenditures, significant increases in operating costs or, in the case of noncompliance, substantial fines or penalties; 
 the effectiveness of our risk-management policies and procedures, and employees violating our risk-management policies; 
 the uncertainty of estimates, including accruals and costs of environmental remediation; 
 advances in technology, including technologies that increase efficiency or that improve electricity s competitive position relative to natural gas; 
 population growth rates and changes in the demographic patterns of the markets we serve in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, and economic conditions in these areas; 
 acts of nature and naturally occurring disasters; 
 political unrest and the potential effects of threatened or actual terrorism and war; 
 the sufficiency of insurance coverage to cover losses; 
 the effects of our strategies to reduce tax payments; 
 changes in accounting standards; 
 changes in corporate governance standards; 
 existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls; 
 our ability to comply with all covenants in our indentures and the ONE Gas Credit Agreement, a violation of which, if not cured in a timely manner, could trigger a default of our obligations; 
 our ability to attract and retain talented employees, management and directors, and shortage of skilled-labor;

 unexpected increases in the costs of providing health care benefits, along with pension and postemployment health care benefits, as well as declines in the discount rates on, declines in the market value of the debt and equity securities of, and increases in funding requirements for, our defined benefit plans; and 
 our ability to successfully complete merger, acquisition or divestiture plans, regulatory or other limitations imposed as a result of a merger, acquisition or divestiture, and the success of the business following a merger, acquisition or divestiture. 
 
 These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results. These and other risks are described in greater detail in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these factors. Other than as required under securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or change in circumstances, expectations or otherwise. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are consistent with those discussed in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Our commodity price risk, driven primarily by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, is mitigated by our purchased-gas cost adjustment mechanisms through which we pass-through natural gas costs to our customers without profit. We may use fixed-price natural gas contracts or derivative instruments to hedge the cost of a portion of our anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to reduce the impact on our customers of upward market price volatility of natural gas. Additionally, we inject natural gas into storage during the warmer months, when natural gas prices are typically lower, and withdraw the natural gas during the colder months of the year. Gains or losses associated with these derivative instruments and the costs of our fixed-price natural gas contracts and storage activities are included in, and recoverable through our purchased-gas cost adjustment mechanisms, which are subject to review by regulatory authorities. 
 
 Interest-Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to interest-rate risk primarily associated with commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under our credit agreement, and new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including future contractual obligations and maturities of long-term and short-term debt. We may manage interest-rate risk on future borrowings through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt and, at times, interest-rate swaps. Fixed-rate swaps may be used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating-rate swaps may be used to convert the fixed rates of long-term borrowings into short-term variable rates. 
 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 
 We assess the creditworthiness of our customers. Those customers who do not meet minimum standards are required to provide security, including deposits or other forms of collateral, when appropriate and allowed by tariff. With approximately 2.3 million customers across three states, we are not exposed materially to a concentration of credit risk. We maintain a provision for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends, consideration of the current credit environment and other information. We are able to recover the fuel-related portion of bad debts through our purchased-gas cost adjustment mechanisms. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Quarterly Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures - Our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report based on the evaluation of the controls and procedures required by Rules 13(a)-15(b) of the Exchange Act. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 38

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We are a party to various litigation matters and claims that have arisen in the normal course of our operations. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the reasonably possible losses from such matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not material. Additionally, we believe the probable final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Our investors should consider the risks set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report that could affect us and our business. Although we have tried to discuss key factors, our investors need to be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. Investors should carefully consider the discussion of risks and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report, including Forward-Looking Statements, which are included in Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 Not applicable. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES
