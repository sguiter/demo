Reverse
Stock Split 

On
March 25, 2024, at a special meeting of the Company s stockholders (the Special Meeting ), the stockholders
of the Company approved an amendment to our Certificate of Formation, as amended and restated, to effect a reverse stock split of our
issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, by a ratio of between one-for-two to one-for-fifty inclusive,
with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number to be determined by our Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof in
its discretion, at any time after approval of the amendment and prior to March 25, 2025 (the Stockholder Authority ). 

On
October 7, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ), with the Stockholder Authority, approved an
amendment to our Certificate of Formation, as amended and restated, to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of
1-for-15 (the Reverse Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock Split is more fully described in the Company s definitive
proxy statement, which was filed with the Commission on March 1, 2024. 

On
October 8, 2024, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Formation, as amended and restated (the Certificate
of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas to affect the Reverse Stock Split. 

Pursuant
to the Certificate of Amendment, the Reverse Stock Split became effective on October 16, 2024, at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time (the Effective
Time ). The shares of the Company s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq on a post-split basis on October 16, 2024, with new CUSIP number: 56270V205. No change was made to the trading symbol for the Company s
shares of common stock, MGRX , in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. 

At
the Effective Time, every fifteen (15) shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into one (1) share of issued and
outstanding common stock, and the total outstanding shares of common stock were reduced from approximately 35.5 million to approximately
2.4 million, without giving effect to any rounding up of fractional shares. 

No
fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders of record who otherwise would be entitled to receive
fractional shares, were entitled to have their fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share. No stockholders received cash
in lieu of fractional shares. 

In
addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our stock options and other equity awards (including shares
reserved for issuance under the Company s equity compensation plan) were proportionately adjusted by the applicable administrator,
using the 1-for-15 ratio, to be effective at the Effective Time, pursuant to the terms of the Company s equity plans. In addition,
the exercise price for each outstanding stock option and warrant will be increased in inverse proportion to the 1-for-15 split ratio
such that upon an exercise, the aggregate exercise price payable by the optionee or warrant holder to the Company for the shares subject
to the option or warrant will remain approximately the same as the aggregate exercise price prior to the Reverse Stock Split, subject
to the terms of such securities. Similar changes were made to other outstanding convertible securities. 

The
effects of the Reverse Stock Split have been retroactively reflected throughout this Report unless otherwise stated.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the condensed interim
consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited
consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023,
which were included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024 (the 2023
Annual Report ). The following discussion contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future results
of the Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company
operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the management of the Company. See also Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Information , above. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, 
 goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, 
 seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify
such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions
that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report and in other reports we file with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any
forward-looking statements for any reason, except as otherwise provided by law. 

The
following discussion is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. In the course of operating our business, we routinely
make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the shipment of products, and the
fulfillment of orders, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period.
In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition,
internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to sales returns, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially
goodwill and intangible assets, assumptions used in the valuation of stock-based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Certain
capitalized terms used below but not otherwise defined, are defined in, and shall be read along with the meanings given to such
terms in, the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, above.

 used in an FDA approved drug. However, the fact that Semaglutide is used in an FDA approved drug, and that Vitamin B6 is available

We

Recent
Events 

In
addition to the recent funding events and agreements described in greater detail below under Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent
Events , the following material transactions took place during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 

Patent
Purchase Agreement 

Effective
on April 24, 2024, the Company entered into a Patent Purchase Agreement (the IP Purchase Agreement ), with Intramont
Technologies, Inc. Intramont ). Pursuant to the IP Purchase Agreement, we purchased certain patents and patent applications
owned by Intramont, related to prevention of infections, including the common cold, respiratory diseases, and orally transmitted diseases
such as human papillomavirus (HPV) (the Patents ), in consideration for 20,000,000, which is payable to Intramont
by (a) the issuance of 980,000 shares of the Company s then newly designated 6 Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series
C Preferred Stock ), with a face value of 20.00 per share, for a total value of 19,600,000 (the Series C Shares 
and (b) 400,000 in cash, (i) with 200,000 payable on or before June 30, 2024, (ii) 100,000 payable on or before August 31, 2024, and
(iii) 100,000 payable on or before November 30, 2024 (collectively, the Cash Payments ). 

In
the event any of the Cash Payments have not been made on or before the due date thereof as provided above, we have 30 days to cure such
non-payment, and if not paid by the end of such 30 day period, we have the option of paying Intramont 15,000 for a thirty day extension
period for each Cash Payment. The Company and Intramont have agreed to payment in full of amounts owed, by December 31, 2024, of which
 25,000 has been paid as of September 30, 2024. 

The
IP Purchase Agreement, and the purchase of the Patents, closed on April 24, 2024, upon the parties entry into the IP Purchase Agreement,
and the Series C Shares were also issued on April 24, 2024. 

The
IP Purchase Agreement included standard representations and warranties and confidentiality and indemnification obligations of the parties,
for a transaction of that type and size. 

The
Company purchased the Patents through its newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, MangoRx IP Holdings, LLC, a Texas limited liability company. 

The
IP Purchase Agreement also included a grant back license, whereby the Company provided Intramont, an irrevocable, co-exclusive, non-transferable
and non-assignable (except in the event of a change of control), non-sublicensable, worldwide, license to use the Patents for the lives
thereof (the Grant Back-License ). The Grant Back-License is subject to Intramont paying the Company a royalty of
ten percent (10 of gross worldwide sales of products sold by Intramont which utilize the Patents, beginning on April 24, 2025, and
continuing until the end of the life of the last Patent (the Royalty Payments ). The Royalty Payments are to be paid
to the Company on an annual basis, within 30 days after the end of the calendar year. 

Finally,
the IP Purchase Agreement granted Intramont a right of first refusal, which provides that, if at any time prior to April 24, 2027, if
we receive an offer to purchase the Patents and determine to accept such offer, or we determine to sell the Patents to a third party,
we are required to provide Intramont the right of first refusal to either match such offer, or negotiate different purchase terms for
the Patents. 

The
Company intends to utilize the Patents by commencing research, development, clinical trial studies and efficacy testing on a variety
of oral applications including, but not limited to, an oral dissolvable tablet (ODT), lozenge, toothpaste and/or mouthwash. 

The
terms of the Company s Series C Preferred Stock are described in greater detail in the Current Report on Form 8-K that the Company

Master
Distribution Agreement 

On
July 9, 2024, we entered into a Master Distribution Agreement with ISFLST, Inc. ISFLST dated July 2, 2024 (the
 Distribution Agreement ). Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we agreed to sell, and ISFLST agreed to purchase,
certain of our products, including our MangoRx Grow and Mango ED products (collectively, the Products ), for distribution
and resale by ISFLST during the term of the agreement. 

Pursuant
to the Distribution Agreement, ISFLST agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell and promote the sale of the Products in Asia
Pacific and Latin America (excluding Mexico), and we provided ISFLST a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to market and sell the
Products, and grant sub-licenses (subject to certain pre-requisites and limitations described in greater detail in the Distribution Agreement)
to sell the Products, in the Market. We also agreed, subject to certain future mutually agreed milestones that ISFLST could earn exclusive
rights to market the Products in the applicable Market . 

The
Distribution Agreement has a term of three years and is automatically renewable thereafter for three additional one year terms, unless
either party provides the other notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to an automatic renewal date. The agreement may also be
terminated by the non-breaching party upon the material breach of the agreement by the counterparty and failure to cure such breach after
90 days written notice, or upon insolvency. 

The
Distribution Agreement includes customary confidentiality requirements of the parties, representations and warranties of the parties,
mutual indemnification rights, disclaimers of warranties and limitation of liabilities, and force majeure provisions. 

The
Distribution Agreement also includes a non-solicitation obligation of ISFLST, which applies during the term of the agreement and for
two years thereafter. 

All
pricing information will be mutually agreed to by the parties and set forth in a separate purchase order, subject to availability and
volume requirements. 

Plan
of Operations 

We
had a working deficit of 1.3 million as of September 30, 2024. With our current cash on hand, expected revenues, and based on our current
average monthly expenses, we currently anticipate the need for additional funding in order to continue our operations at their current
levels and to pay the costs associated with being a public company for the next 12 months. We may also require additional funding in
the future to expand or complete acquisitions. 

Our
plan for the next 12 months is to continue using the same marketing and management strategies and continue providing a quality product
with excellent customer service while also seeking to expand our operations organically or through acquisitions as funding and opportunities
arise. As our business continues to grow, customer feedback will be integral in making small adjustments to improve products and our
overall customer experience. 

We
are headquartered in Dallas, Texas and intend to grow our business both organically and through identifying acquisition targets over
the next 12 months in the technology, health and wellness space, funding permitting. Specifically, we plan to continue to make additional
and ongoing technology enhancements to our platform, further develop, market and advertise additional men s health and wellness
related products on our telemedicine platform, and identify strategic acquisitions that complement our vision. As these opportunities
arise, we will determine the best method for financing such acquisitions and growth which may include the issuance of debt instruments,
common stock, preferred stock, or a combination thereof, all of which may result in significant dilution to existing shareholders. 

41 

 Table of Contents 

We
may seek additional funding in the future through equity financings, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations
with other companies or other strategic transactions, a portion of which we expect to raise pursuant to the SPA and ELOC, which are discussed
in detail above. We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect
the holdings or rights of our shareholders and/or create significant dilution. Although we continue to pursue these plans, there is no
assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continued operations, if at all. 

Results
of Operations 

Comparison
of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenues 

We
began generating revenues in November 2022 and had revenues of 133,368 and 245,160 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. 

Revenue
decreased by 111,792 or 45.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, due
to issues arising while the Company migrated from its previous telehealth platform to its newly developed telehealth platform, resulting
in a delay in marketing activities of the Company s products. 

Cost
of Revenues 

We
had cost of revenues of 21,505 and 52,193 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, attributed to costs
associated with the Company s third party doctor s network and product shipping costs, and related party cost of revenues
of 29,192 and 48,378 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, relating to amounts paid to Epiq Scripts,
LLC Epiq Scripts ), a related party, 51 owned and controlled by Jacob D. Cohen, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, which entity provides us pharmacy and compounding services. The related party cost of revenues was associated with a Master
Services Agreement entered into with Epiq Scripts and a related statement of work and the remaining cost of revenues was attributed to
the amounts paid to our unrelated party doctors network and shipping expenses. 

Cost
of revenues decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, directly
corelated to the decrease in products sold. 

The
Company analyzed the following factors when determining the amounts to be paid to Epiq Scripts under the Master Services Agreement and
related statement of work: a) the fairness of the terms for the Company (including fairness from a financial point of view); b) the materiality
of the transaction; c) bids / terms for a similar transaction from unrelated parties; d) the structure of the transaction; and e) the
interests of each related party in the transaction. 

Gross
Profit 

We
had gross profit of 82,671 and 144,589 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which gross profit decreased
due to the decrease in revenue over the period and an increase in shipping costs and the Company offering various discounts and incentives
to attract first time customers. 

Operating
Expenses 

We
had total general and administrative expenses of 1,840,745 and 1,944,049, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
a decrease of 103,304 from the prior period. 

42 

 Table of Contents 

The
decrease in general administration expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period, was due primarily
to increased accounting and auditing fees of 40,204 and 9,200, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
which was in connection with fees paid to our accountants and auditors in connection with the preparation and reviews of our financial
statements included in our quarterly reports and the audit of our financial report included in our annual report. Software development
fees of 188,782 and 70,599 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the front and backend development
of our website in the current period. Software development expenses are integral to customers accessing our ordering system and successfully
placing an order for our products. These increases are offset by decreases in general consulting related expenses of 86,735 and 156,929,
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to other various consulting fees paid in connection with
our operations in the current period. Insurance related expenses of 38,571 and 104,486 for the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively, related to general and liability insurance and for director and officer insurance in the current period. 

Salary
and benefits were 242,941 and 271,466 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which decreased due to
a decrease in our executive salaries due to a reduction in headcount. 

Advertising
and marketing expenses in the amount of 251,330 and 720,531, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
related to our cost of acquiring new customers through social media influencers, online advertising and special events. 

We
had 255,000 of investor relations expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, related to awareness of our stock to the public
market, compared to 255,500 of investor relations expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Stock-based
compensation totaled 567,619 and 151,592 (including a total of 458,861 and 84,752 attributed to stock issued for services and
 84,752 and 66,842 attributed to stock-based compensation from issuances of options and warrants), for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which increase was due to which increase was mainly due to bonuses issued to certain
officers, directors and employees for services rendered. 

Other
Expense 

We

 Table of Contents 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a working deficit of 1.3 million and a total accumulated deficit of 17,985,966. 

We
have mainly relied on related party loans, as well as funds raised through the sale of securities, mainly through a private placement
offering, our IPO, our Follow On Offering, the sale of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and shares of common stock pursuant to the
ELOC, each discussed below, and revenues generated from sales of our products, to support our operations since inception. We have primarily
used our available cash to pay operating expenses. We do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures, except pursuant
to the terms of the SPA and ELOC, discussed in greater detail below. 

Need
for Future Funding; Review of Strategic Alternatives 

We
have experienced recurring net losses since inception. We believe that we will continue to incur substantial operating expenses in the
foreseeable future as we continue to invest to bring Prime and our Compounded Products to market and to attract customers, expand the
product offerings and enhance technology and infrastructure. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not
succeed in generating commercial revenues or net income to offset these expenses. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve profitability,
and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory
paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our current capital resources,
are not expected to be sufficient for us to fund operations for the next 12 months. We need to raise funding in addition to the funding
raised in our IPO and Follow On Offering, to support our operations in the future, a portion of which we expect to raise pursuant to
the SPA and ELOC. We may also seek to acquire additional businesses or assets in the future, which may require us to raise funding. We
currently anticipate such funding being raised through the offering of debt or equity. Such additional financing, if required, may not
be available on favorable terms, if at all. If debt financing is available and obtained, our interest expense may increase and we may
be subject to the risk of default, depending on the terms of such financing. If equity financing is available and obtained it may result
in our shareholders experiencing significant dilution. If such financing is unavailable, we may be forced to curtail our business plan,
which may cause the value of our securities to decline in value. 

To
support our existing operations or any future expansion of business, including the ability to execute our growth strategy, we must have
sufficient capital to continue to make investments and fund operations. We have plans to pursue an aggressive growth strategy for the
expansion of operations through marketing to attract new customers for Prime and our Compounded Products. 

Additionally,
the Company recently initiated a formal review process to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company. The Board of Directors and
management team are committed to acting in the best interests of the Company, its stockholders and its stakeholders. There is no deadline
or definitive timetable set for completion of the strategic alternatives review process and there can be no assurance that this process
will result in the Company pursuing a transaction or any other strategic outcome. Transactions which may be undertaken by the Company,
may include, but are not limited to, business combinations, liquidations of assets and/or a sale of the Company or its assets. The Company
does not intend to make any further public comment regarding the review of strategic alternatives until it has been completed or the
Company determines that a disclosure is required by law or otherwise deemed appropriate. Risks relating to a potential strategic transaction
are disclosed in greater detail under the risk factor titled We may enter into strategic transactions in the future which may
result in a material change in our operations and/or a change of control , under Part II Other Information 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors .

ten (10) calendar days of the execution and delivery of the Amendment, the Company was required to file a new registration statement
on Form S-1 to provide for the registration of (a) 977,778 shares of common stock issuable in respect of the Series B Preferred Stock
sold in each of the Second Closing, the Third Closing, and the Fourth Closing and (b) 100,000 shares of common stock issuable pursuant
to the Additional Warrants. 

The
Company agreed, among other things, to indemnify the Purchaser and its affiliates with respect to certain liabilities and to pay all
fees and expenses incident to the Company s obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement. 

Description
of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock 

On
March 28, 2024, the Company submitted for filing to the Secretary of State of Texas, a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of Mangoceuticals, Inc. (the Series B Designation ), which was filed with
the Secretary of State of Texas on April 4, 2024, effective as of March 28, 2024. 

The
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock terms are described in greater detail in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with
the SEC on April 11, 2024. On June 27, 2024, with the approval of the Company and the sole shareholder of the Series B Preferred Stock,
the Company amended the Series B Designation, to increase the floor price of the Series B Preferred Stock from 0.525 per share to 2.25
per share. 

Equity
Purchase Agreement 

Also
on the Initial Closing Date, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the ELOC with the Purchaser
pursuant to which the Purchaser committed to purchase up to 25,000,000 (the Maximum Amount of the Company s
common stock (the Financing ). On the Initial Closing Date, the Company issued 66,667 shares of the Company s
common stock to the Purchaser as a commitment fee (the Commitment Shares ). In connection with the Financing, on
the Closing Date, the Company and the Purchaser also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the ELOC RRA ). 

Upon
filing and effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-1 to register the Advance Shares (defined below), which was declared effective
on May 9, 2024, and provided other closing conditions are met, from time to time over the term of the ELOC, the Company has the right,
but not the obligation, to direct the Purchaser to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (the Advance Shares in a maximum amount of one hundred percent (100 of the average daily trading volume over the five trading days preceding the applicable
advance date. At any time and from time to time during the 2-year term of the ELOC (the Commitment Period ), the
Company may deliver a notice to Purchaser (the Advance Notice and shall deliver the Advance Shares to Purchaser
via DWAC (as defined in the ELOC) on the next trading day. The purchase price (the Purchase Price for the Advance
Shares shall equal 90.0 of the gross proceeds received by the Purchaser for the resale of the Advance Shares during the three consecutive
trading days immediately following the date an Advance Notice is delivered (the Valuation Period ). The closing of
an Advance Notice shall occur within two trading days following the end of the respective Valuation Period, whereby the Purchaser shall
deliver the Investment Amount (as defined below) to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Company shall not
deliver another Advance Notice to Purchaser within one trading day of a prior closing of Advance Shares. The Investment Amount 
means the aggregate Purchase Price for the Advance Shares purchased by the Purchaser, minus clearing costs payable to the Purchaser s
broker or to the Company s transfer agent for the issuance of the Advance Shares.

 Table of Contents 

The
right of the Company to issue and sell the Advance Shares to the Purchaser is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions,
including, but not limited to, (i) a Registration Statement on Form S-1 registering for resale by the Purchaser of the Advance Shares
and Commitment Shares being declared effective by the SEC, which has occurred to date, (ii) accuracy of the Company s representations
and warranties, (iii) the Company s performance under the ELOC in all material respects, (iv) no suspension of trading or delisting
of common stock, (v) the limitation of the Purchaser s beneficial ownership of the Company s common stock to no more than
4.99 of the Company s then outstanding common stock, (vi) the Company maintaining its DWAC-eligible status, (vii) the Company
maintaining a sufficient share reserve, and (viii) the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date the Advance Notice
is received must exceed 0.15. To date, the Company has sold a total of 230,000 shares for gross proceeds of 999,667 before fees, discounts
and expenses under the ELOC. 

The
ELOC terminates upon the first to occur of April 4, 2026; the date that 25,000,000 in Advance Shares have been purchased by the Purchaser;
the date that the Company terminates the ELOC, which may be terminated in the Company s option at any time following effectiveness
of the Registration Statement registering the resale of the Advance Shares, except that the ELOC can t be terminated at any time
the Purchaser holds any Advance Shares; and upon the Company entering into bankruptcy protection (such period of time that the ELOC is
in place, the Commitment Period ). 

Pursuant
to the ELOC, the Purchaser agreed, that neither it, nor any of its affiliates, will in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly,
during the period commencing on the date of the ELOC and ending on (x) earlier of the date of the delivery of the first Advance Notice
by the Company, and (y) the date that is six months from the date the ELOC was entered into (the Lock-Up Termination Date ),
(i) offer, pledge, announce the intention to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option
or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, make any short sale, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, any shares
of common stock; (ii) enter into any transaction that is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the transfer to another
person, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any shares of common stock (each, a Disposition 
or (iii) publicly disclose the intention to make any Disposition or engage in any short sale, without the prior written consent of the
Company. 

While
the Company has the obligation to maintain such share reserve while the ELOC is effective, the Company does not have the obligation to
sell any Advance Shares to the Purchaser. Additionally, neither the Purchaser, nor any affiliate of the Purchaser acting on its behalf
or pursuant to any understanding with it, will execute any short sales during the period from the date hereof to the end of the Commitment
Period. 

In
connection with the ELOC, the Company entered into the ELOC RRA with the Purchaser. Pursuant to the ELOC RRA, the Company was required
to file a resale registration statement (the ELOC Registration Statement with the SEC to register all common stock
underlying the Advance Shares, and the Commitment Shares, which was declared effective on May 9, 2024. 

The
Company has agreed, among other things, to indemnify the Purchaser and its affiliates with respect to certain liabilities and to pay
all fees and expenses incident to the Company s obligations under the ELOC RRA.

Need
for Future Funding 

As
discussed above, our current capital resources are not expected to be sufficient for us to fund operations for the next 12 months. We
believe we will need funding to support our operations in the future. We may also seek to acquire additional businesses or assets in
the future, which may require us to raise funding. As noted above, we have entered into a SPA and ELOC agreements, which are detailed
above, for additional funding to help meet our capital requirements over the next 12 months, which will result in shareholder dilution.
Additional funding, if required, may be raised through the offering of debt or equity. Such additional financing, if required, may not
be available on favorable terms, if at all. If debt financing is available and obtained, our interest expense may increase and we may
be subject to the risk of default, depending on the terms of such financing. If equity financing is available and obtained it may result
in our shareholders experiencing significant dilution. If such financing is unavailable, we may be forced to curtail our business plan,
which may cause the value of our securities to decline in value. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of the Company s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities and expenses. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited financial statements
included in Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements , above describes the significant accounting policies used in the
preparation of the financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent
uncertainty and require significant judgments. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. To the extent that there
are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows will be affected. 

A
critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management
to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: (1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that
are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate
that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Estimates
and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new
events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor
and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies
and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that our financial statements
are fairly stated in accordance with GAAP and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations.
We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation
of our condensed consolidated financial statements: 

Share-Based
Compensation - Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 718, which requires
recognition in the condensed consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments over the shorter of period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award
or the vesting period. ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award
based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Pursuant to ASC 505-50, for share-based payments to non-employees, compensation expense
is determined at the measurement date. The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the
measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense
based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. Additionally, we used this same methodology when determining the fair value
of our restricted common stock issuances to managers and other related parties. 

53 

 Table of Contents 

Estimating
the Fair Value of Common Stock - We are required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock-based awards
and warrants when performing the fair value calculations using the Black-Scholes option pricing model 

Our
determination of the fair value of stock options with time-based vesting on the date of grant utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, and is impacted by our common stock price as well as other variables including, but not limited to, expected term that options
will remain outstanding, expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards, risk-free interest rates and expected
dividends. Estimating the fair value of equity-settled awards as of the grant date using valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes
option pricing model, is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex variables. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect
the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require
significant analysis and judgment to develop. 

Warrants
- In accordance with ASC 480, the Company classifies as equity any contracts that (i) require physical settlement or net-share
settlement or (ii) gives the Company a choice of net-cash settlement in its own shares. The Company classifies as liabilities any contracts
that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net-cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is
outside the control of the Company) or (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares. 

The
Company accounts for its currently issued warrants in conjunction with the Company s ordinary shares in permanent equity. These
warrants are indexed to the Company s stock and meet the requirements of equity classification as prescribed under ASC 815-40.
Warrants classified as equity are initially measured at fair value, and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized so long as
the warrants continue to be classified as equity. The value of the warrant is based on accepted valuation procedures and practices that
rely substantially on the third-party professional s use of numerous assumptions and its consideration of various factors that
are relevant to the operation of the Company. 

JOBS
Act and Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The
JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private
companies. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act,
for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the
earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act. 

We
have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and may impact our financial statements and we do not believe that
there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB that are
adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. If not discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards,
which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements upon adoption.

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable
segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the
Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM and included within each reported measure of a segment s profit or loss. This
ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses
the reported measures of a segment s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The
ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption
is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating
the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information
about a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is
effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial
statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will result in the required additional disclosures
being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act,
means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

There
are no pending or threatened legal proceedings involving our company. However, from time to time, we may become involved in various legal
proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Those claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure by us
of significant financial and managerial resources. We may become involved in material legal proceedings in the future. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Reference
is made to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors included in our 2023 Annual Report for information concerning risk factors,
which should be read in conjunction with the factors set forth in Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
of this Report and below. There have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, except
as discussed below. You should carefully consider such factors in the 2023 Annual Report, and below, which could materially affect our
business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in the 2023 Annual Report and below, are not the only risks facing
our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Our
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and 6 Series C Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock include a liquidation preference. 

Our
Series B Preferred Stock includes a liquidation preference of 1,100 per share, which may be increased from time to time pursuant to
the terms of such Series B Preferred Stock (currently totaling an aggregate of 1,342,000 for all 1,220 outstanding shares of Series
B Preferred Stock) which is payable upon liquidation, before any distribution to our common stock shareholders. Our Series C Preferred
Stock includes a liquidation preference of 20 per share, which may be increased from time to time pursuant to the terms of such Series
C Preferred Stock (currently totaling an aggregate of 19,600,000 for all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock) which is payable
upon liquidation, before any distribution to our common stock shareholders, but after distributions to our Series B Preferred Stock holders.
As a result, if we were to dissolve, liquidate or sell our assets, the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock would have the right to
receive up to the first approximately 1,342,000 in proceeds from any such transaction and holders of our Series C Preferred Stock would
have the right to receive up to approximately 19.6 million of the remaining proceeds from any such transaction. The payment of the liquidation
preferences could result in common stock shareholders not receiving any consideration if we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either
voluntarily or involuntarily. Additionally, the existence of the liquidation preferences may reduce the value of our common stock, make
it harder for us to sell shares of common stock in offerings in the future, or prevent or delay a change of control. Because our Board
of Directors is entitled to designate the powers and preferences of the preferred stock without a vote of our shareholders, subject to
Nasdaq rules and regulations, our shareholders will have no control over what designations and preferences our future preferred stock,
if any, will have. 

The
issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock and upon exercise of the Warrants
will cause immediate and substantial dilution to existing shareholders. 

Each
holder of Series B Preferred Stock may, at its option, convert its shares of Series B Preferred Stock into that number of shares of common
stock equal to the Stated Value of such share of Series B Preferred Stock (initially 1,100 per share), divided by the lesser of (x)
 6.00, or (y) 90 of the average of the three lowest volume weighted average prices during the ten trading days preceding and ending
on and including the conversion date subject to adjustment as provided in the designation (the Conversion Price ).
Further, in no event shall the Conversion Price be less than 2.25, subject to adjustment in the designation or the mutual agreement
of the holder and the Company (the Floor Price ). The Conversion Price is subject to anti-dilutive rights in the
event that the Company issues any shares of common stock or common stock equivalents with a value less than the then conversion price,
subject to certain customary exceptions for equity plan issuances, securities already outstanding, and certain strategic acquisitions,
subject to the Floor Price. 

56 

 Table of Contents 

The
designation of the Series B Preferred Stock also provides that if at any time and from time to time when the shares are outstanding there
occurs any share split, share dividend, share combination recapitalization or other similar transaction involving the common stock shares
(each, a Share Combination Event , and such date thereof, the Share Combination Event Date and the Event Market Price is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then on the sixth trading day immediately following such
Share Combination Event Date, the Conversion Price then in effect on such sixth trading day shall be reduced (but in no event increased)
to the greater of the (i) Event Market Price and (ii) Floor Price. For the avoidance of doubt, if the adjustment in the immediately preceding
sentence would otherwise result in an increase in the Conversion Price hereunder, no adjustment shall be made. The Event Market
Price means, with respect to any Share Combination Event Date, the quotient determined by dividing (x) the sum of the VWAP
of the common stock for each of the five trading days ending and including the trading day immediately preceding the sixth trading day
after such Share Combination Event Date, divided by (y) five (5). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Conversion Price was reduced
to 2.53. 

Each
holder of Series C Preferred Stock may, at its option, convert its shares of Series C Preferred Stock into that number of shares of common
stock equal to the Stated Value of such share of Series C Preferred Stock, divided by the conversion price of 150.00 per share (i.e.,
initially a 2-for-1 conversion ratio) (the Conversion Price ), subject to adjustment for stock splits and stock dividends,
with any fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share. 

The
issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock will result in immediate and substantial
dilution to the interests of other stockholders since the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock may ultimately
receive and sell the full amount of shares issuable in connection with the conversion of such Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock. Although the Series B Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock may not be converted by the holders thereof if such conversion
would cause such holder to own more than 4.99 (4.999 in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock) of our outstanding common stock (which
may be increased to 9.999 with at least 61 days prior written notice on a per shareholder basis for holders of our Series C Preferred
Stock), these restrictions do not prevent such holders from converting some of their holdings, selling those shares, and then converting
the rest of their holdings, while still staying below the 4.99 /9.999 limit. In this way, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock
and Series C Preferred Stock could sell more than these limits while never actually holding more shares than the limits allow. If the
holders of the Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock choose to do this, it will cause substantial dilution to the then
holders of our common stock. 

The
availability of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock for public resale,
as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size
of future issuances of our common stock upon the conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock and/or upon
exercise of the Warrants, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market
price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock upon the conversion of our Series B Preferred
Stock and Series C Preferred Stock and upon exercise of the Warrants, or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market
price of our common stock to decline. 

In
addition, the common stock issuable upon the conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock and upon exercise
of the Warrants may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there
is a greater supply of a company s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens the price of our
stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share
price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb shares sold by holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred
Stock and Warrants, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease. 

57 

 Table of Contents 

We
have filed a registration statement to permit the public resale of certain of the shares of common stock that may be issued upon the
conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock and the exercise of the Warrants. The influx of those shares
into the public market could potentially have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. 

Our
outstanding Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock accrue a dividend. 

From
and after the issuance date of the Series B Preferred Stock, of which 1,220 shares are currently outstanding, each share of Series B
Preferred Stock is entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized and declared by the Board of Directors of the Company, out of any
funds legally available therefor, cumulative dividends in an amount equal to (i) the 10 per annum on the stated value (initially 1,100
per share or 110 per year) as of the record date for such dividend (as described in the Series B Designation), and (ii) on an as-converted
basis, any dividend or other distribution, whether paid in cash, in-kind or in other property, authorized and declared by the Board of
Directors on the issued and outstanding shares of common stock in an amount determined by assuming that the number of shares of common
stock into which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock could be converted on the applicable record date for such dividend or distribution. 

From
and after the issuance date of the Series C Preferred Stock, each share of Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to receive, when, as
and if authorized and declared by the Board of Directors of the Company, out of any funds legally available therefor, cumulative dividends
in an amount equal to (i) the 6 per annum on the stated value (initially 20 per share) as of the record date for such dividend (as
described in the Series C Designation), and (ii) on an as-converted basis, any dividend or other distribution, whether paid in cash,
in-kind or in other property, authorized and declared by the Board of Directors on the issued and outstanding shares of common stock
in an amount determined by assuming that the number of shares of common stock into which such shares of Series C Preferred Stock could
be converted on the applicable record date for such dividend or distribution. 

Accrued
dividends may be settled in cash, subject to applicable law, shares of common stock (valued at the closing price on the date the dividend
is due) or in-kind, by increasing the stated value by the amount of the quarterly dividend. 

In
the event dividends are paid in common stock of the Company, the number of shares payable will be calculated by dividing the accrued
dividend by the closing sales price of the Company s common stock. If the Company is prohibited from paying, or chooses not to
pay the dividend in cash or common stock, the Company may pay the dividend by increasing the Stated Value of the preferred stock. 

We
may choose not to pay such dividends in cash, may not have sufficient available cash to pay the dividends as they accrue or may be prohibited
contractually, or pursuant to applicable law, from paying such dividends in cash. The payment of the dividends could reduce our available
cash on hand, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cause the value of our stock to decline in value. Additionally,
the issuance of shares of common stock or an increase in the Stated Value of our Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock
in lieu of cash dividends (and the subsequent conversion of such Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock into common stock
pursuant to the terms of such Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock) could cause substantial dilution to the then holders
of our common stock. 

Certain
of our outstanding warrants include anti-dilution and reset rights. 

At
the Initial Closing, the Company issued the Purchaser warrants to purchase up to 220,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price
of 3.90 per share and at the Third Closing, the Company issued the Purchaser (a) warrants to purchase up to 66,667 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of 0.50 per share; and (b) warrants to purchase up to 33,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of 0.67 per share. The exercise price of the Warrants (the Exercise Price is subject to adjustment in the event
of customary stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events. If at any time following the 120 th day after the
Initial Closing, there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for the
shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, the Warrants can be exercised on a cashless basis and the Company is subject
to certain liquidated damages and damages as described in greater detail in the agreements evidencing the Warrants. The Initial Warrants
are exercisable until April 4, 2029 and the Additional Warrants were exercisable on or after October 4, 2024, and for five years thereafter. 

58 

 Table of Contents 

The
Warrants contain provisions that prohibit exercise if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99 
of the number of the Company s shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. The holder
of the Warrants may increase or decrease this percentage, but not in excess of 9.99 , by providing at least 61 days prior notice
to the Company. In the event of certain corporate transactions, the holder of the Warrants will be entitled to receive, upon exercise
of the warrants, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that the holder would have received had it exercised the Warrants
immediately prior to such transaction. 

If
the Company or any subsidiary at any time while the Warrants are outstanding, shall sell, enter into an agreement to sell or grant any
option to purchase, or sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise dispose of or issue (or announce any offer, sale, grant or any
option to purchase or other disposition) any common stock or common stock equivalents, at an effective price per share less than the
Exercise Price of the Warrants then in effect (such lower price, the Base Share Price and such issuances collectively,
a Dilutive Issuance then simultaneously with the consummation (or, if earlier, the announcement) of each Dilutive
Issuance the Exercise Price shall be reduced and only reduced to equal the Base Share Price. No adjustment however is to be made for
certain customary exempt issuances (as defined in the SPA). 

The
Warrants also include customary buy-in rights in the event the Company fails to timely deliver the shares of common stock issuable upon
exercise thereof. 

If
at any time the Warrants are outstanding there occurs any share split, share dividend, share combination recapitalization or other similar
transaction involving the common stock (each, a Share Combination Event , and such date thereof, the Share
Combination Event Date and the Event Market Price (defined below) is less than the then exercise price then in effect, then
on the sixth trading day immediately following such Share Combination Event Date, the Exercise Price then in effect on such sixth trading
day is automatically reduced (but in no event increased) to the Event Market Price. The Event Market Price means,
with respect to any Share Combination Event Date, the quotient determined by dividing (x) the sum of the volume weighted average price
of the common stock for each of the five trading days ending and including the trading day immediately preceding the sixth trading day
after such Share Combination Event Date, divided by (y) five. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the exercise price of the Warrants
was automatically adjusted to 2.53 per share. 

Anti-dilutive
rights of the Warrants may cause the Exercise Price of the Warrants to decrease significantly, may result to significant dilution to
existing stockholders, and may prevent us from completing otherwise accretive transactions. 

The
sale of shares of common stock under the ELOC may cause significant dilution to existing shareholders. 

The
issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the ELOC (including the Commitment Shares) will not affect the rights of
the Company s existing stockholders, but such issuances will have a dilutive effect on the Company s existing stockholders,
including, over time, the voting power of the existing stockholders. The issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of
the ELOC (pursuant to which we are able to sell up to 25 million shares of common stock, subject to certain requirements, of which 999,667
or 230,000 shares of common stock have been sold to date) will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. The
availability of these shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price
of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the terms of the ELOC, or the effect,
if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions
of substantial amounts of our common stock pursuant to the terms of the ELOC, or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause
the market price of our common stock to decline. 

59 

 Table of Contents 

In
addition, the common stock issuable pursuant to the terms of the ELOC may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the market
price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company s stock in the market than there is demand
for that stock. When this happens the price of our stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell
in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb shares sold by the Purchaser,
then the value of our common stock will likely decrease. 

We
have filed a registration statement to permit the public resale of the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the terms of the ELOC
(including the Commitment Shares). The influx of those shares into the public market could potentially have a negative effect on the
trading price of our common stock. 

The
shares of common stock to be sold pursuant to the terms of the ELOC are to be sold based on a discount to fluctuating market prices and
as a result, we are unable to accurately forecast or predict with certainty the total amount of shares of Company common stock that may
be issued to the Purchaser under the ELOC; however, we expect such sales, if any to cause significant dilution to existing shareholders. 

We
may enter into strategic transactions in the future which may result in a material change in our operations and/or a change of control. 

The
costs and expenses of our public reporting obligations are material, and materially affect our quarterly results of operations and profitability.
The Company has recently initiated a formal review process to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company. The Board of Directors
and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of the Company, its stockholders and its stakeholders. There is no
deadline or definitive timetable set for completion of the strategic alternatives review process and there can be no assurance that this
process will result in the Company pursuing a transaction or any other strategic outcome. Transactions which may be undertaken by the
Company, may include, but are not limited to, business combinations, liquidations of assets and/or a sale of the Company or its assets.
The Company does not intend to make any further public comment regarding the review of strategic alternatives until it has been completed
or the Company determines that a disclosure is required by law or otherwise deemed appropriate. 

As
a result of the above, in the future, we or our majority stockholders, may enter into transactions with parties seeking to merge and/or
acquire us and/or our operations. While we have not entered into any agreements or understandings with any such parties to date, in the
event that we do enter into such a transaction or transactions in the future, our majority stockholder(s) will likely change and new
shares of common stock or preferred stock could be issued resulting in substantial dilution to our then current stockholders. As a result,
our new majority stockholders may change the composition of our Board of Directors and may replace our current management. Any future
transaction may also result in a change in our business focus. We have not entered into any agreements relating to any strategic transaction
involving the Company as of the date of this filing and may not enter into such agreements in the future. Any future strategic transaction
involving the Company or its operations may have a material effect on our operations, cash flows, results of operations, prospects, plan
of operations, the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, our officers, directors and majority stockholder(s), and the value of our securities. 

There
is no guarantee that our common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Our
common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbol MGRX . There is no guarantee that we will be able to
maintain our listing on Nasdaq for any period of time. Among the conditions required for continued listing on Nasdaq, Nasdaq requires
us to maintain at least 2.5 million in stockholders equity, 35 million in market value of listed securities, or 500,000 in
net income over the prior two years or two of the prior three years, to have a majority of independent directors (subject to certain
 controlled company exemptions), to comply with certain audit committee requirements, and to maintain a stock price
over 1.00 per share.

 Table of Contents 

On
October 30, 2023, the Company received written notice (the Notification Letter from the Listing Qualifications Department
of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements
set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires
listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet
the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of thirty (30) consecutive business days. The Notification
Letter did not impact the Company s listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market at that time. The Notification Letter
stated that the Company had 180 calendar days or until April 29, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), provided
that such date was subsequently extended to October 28, 2024, upon request to Nasdaq, and in accordance with Nasdaq s rules. To
regain compliance, the bid price of the Company s common stock must have a closing bid price of at least 1.00 per share for a
minimum of 10 consecutive business days. On October 30, 2024, we were provided notice from Nasdaq that, as a result of the Reverse Stock
Split, we had gained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of Nasdaq. 

Our
stockholders equity has in the past not been above Nasdaq s 2.5 million minimum, we may not generate over 500,000 of yearly
net income moving forward, we may not maintain 35 million in market value of listed securities, we may not be able to maintain independent
directors (to the extent required), and as discussed above, we have in the past not maintained a stock price over 1.00 per share. Nasdaq s
determination that we fail to meet the continued listing standards of Nasdaq may result in our securities being delisted from Nasdaq. 

The
absence of such a listing on Nasdaq may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by other
parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of
our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders
to sell our common stock in the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible to trade
on an over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB Market or the Pink Open Market, where an investor may find it more difficult
to sell our securities or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our securities. In the event our common stock is delisted
from Nasdaq in the future, we may not be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange or obtain quotation on
an over-the counter quotation system. 

A
delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and
our ability to attract new investors, reduce the price at which our common stock trades, decrease, investors ability to make transactions
in our common stock, decrease the liquidity of our outstanding shares, increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares,
and reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital without overall negative effects for our stockholders.
