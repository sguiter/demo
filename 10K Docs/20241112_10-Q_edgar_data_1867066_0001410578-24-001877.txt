 Revenues The following table reflects our net product revenue for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three-Month Periods Ended September 30 Change in thousands) 2024 2023 Qbrexza 7,583 5,865 1,718 29 Accutane 3,996 4,882 (886) -18 Amzeeq 1,542 2,336 (794) -34 Zilxi 558 681 (123) -18 Other / legacy 950 1,515 (565) -37 Total net product revenue 14,629 15,279 (650) -4 Total net product revenues decreased by 0.7 million, or 4 , to 14.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 15.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Qbrexza net product revenue increased by 1.7 million, or 29 , to 7.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 5.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily volume driven, due to our continued marketing efforts and the recent expansion of our access and coverage platforms related to the Qbrexza product. Accutane net product revenue decreased by 0.9 million, or 18 , to 4.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 4.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 due to recent market competition. Amzeeq and Zilxi net product revenue combined, decreased by 0.9 million, or 30 , to 2.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 3.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a slight decrease in unit sales volume and an increase in coupon rebates as a result of the expansion of our patient coverage options under our overall market access program driving average selling prices lower as compared to the prior year quarter. Net Revenue from our legacy products decreased by 0.6 million, or 37 , to 0.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 1.5 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Targadox continues to experience erosion due to generic competition and we discontinued selling Ximino on September 29, 2023. Other Revenue

Under the terms of the Maruho Agreement, Maruho paid us 19.0 million as a non - refundable upfront payment. Maruho is also obligated to make royalty payments to us related to sales of the product in the Territory equal to the corresponding rate payable by us to Dermira under the asset purchase agreement between us and Dermira.

 Gross-to-net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:

Our reserves for gross-to-net sales allowances were 9.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 9.8 million at June 30, 2024, consistent from period-to-period. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold decreased by 1.1 million, or 18 , to 5.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 6.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 driving an increase in our gross product margin of 6.0 , from 57.9 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 63.9 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in cost of goods sold and related increase in our gross product margin from period-to-period is mainly due to 0.6 million in inventory charges recorded in the prior year period and a decrease of 0.2 million in product royalties from the same period in 2023, resulting from lower sales of Accutane and the contractual expiration of our Exelderm product royalty in November 2023. Additionally, Prescription User Drug (PDUFA) fees were lower than the same period in 2023 by 0.3 million, due to the discontinuation of Ximino in September of 2023. Non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets was 0.8 million for each of the three-month periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023. Research and Development Research and Development R D expenses decreased by 1.4 million, to 0.8 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 2.2 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily driven by lower clinical trial expenses to develop Emrosi, offset slightly by R D-related launch costs for the product, as the clinical phase of the project has concluded, and our Emrosi launch efforts have commenced. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses increased by 2.8 million, or 32 , to 11.4 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 8.6 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly due to increases non-cash share-based compensation expense and overall selling and marketing expenses. Non-cash share-based compensation expense increased by 1.0 million as a result of an increase in outstanding equity awards from the same period in 2023. The remaining increase is primarily due to the expansion of our access and coverage platforms and the commencement of our launch efforts for Emrosi related mainly to market research and access and corporate headcount. Additionally, product sample expenses increased from the same period in 2023 due to the timing of delivery of product samples from period-to-period, as the bulk of our product sample expense in 2023 occurred in the first half of the year.

 Interest Income Interest income increased by 0.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. Interest income reflects the income earned on our high yield money market account. The increase is due to a higher invested balance compared to the prior year resulting from entering into the SWK Credit Facility in December 2023, and to a lesser extent, a slight increase in investment yield. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by 0.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. In July 2023, we satisfied all of our outstanding debt obligations with East West Bank EWB by voluntarily repaying the outstanding balance on our term loan under the Loan and Security Agreement with EWB. As such, we had no additional debt or borrowing of funds until entering into the Credit Facility with SWK in December of 2023. Comparison of the Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

The increase is due to an increase in unit sales volume driven by our continued marketing efforts and the expansion of our access and coverage platforms related to Qbrexza. Accutane net product revenue increased by 0.4 million, or 3 , to 15.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 15.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 due to increased unit volume from the expansion of our customer and distribution base as a result of our focused selling and marketing efforts for Accutane. Amzeeq and Zilxi combined net product revenue decreased by 1.8 million, or 27 , to 4.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 6.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is substantially due to decreased unit sales volume. In addition, coupon rebates were higher as a result of the expansion of coverage options under our overall market access program. Additionally, managed care rebates increased from the same period in 2023 due to higher managed care utilization and cost increases, driving Amzeeq and Zilxi s average selling price lower than the prior year. Net revenue from our legacy products decreased by 1.9 million, or 41 , to 2.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 4.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 due to the continued price erosion of Targadox from generic competition, and the discontinuation of Ximino on September 29, 2023.

The decrease in the returns reserve reflects lower units on hand in the wholesaler channel. The decrease in the coupon and managed care reserves is primarily a result of the timing of credits and invoices received at the end of 2023, leading to a higher reserves at December 31, 2023.

 Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold COGS decreased by 2.0 million, or 10 , to 18.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 20.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Product royalties were lower by 1.0 million compared to the same period in 2023 due to the contractual expiration of our Exelderm product royalty in November 2023, the contractual decrease in our Qbrexza royalty in the second quarter of 2023, and the discontinuation of Ximino in September of 2023. In addition, the discontinuation of Ximo has resulted in lower PDUFA fees of 0.8 million and lower non-cash license amortization of 0.5 million. These decreases were offset, in part, by an increase in product COGS of 0.5 million, as a result of product mix, mainly driven by the higher Accutane net product revenue from period-to-period. Research and Development R D expense increased by 3.6 million, to 9.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 6.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase is driven by the 4.1 million filing fee payment to the FDA for Emrosi in January 2024 and a 3.0 million payment for the contractual milestone payment owed to Dr. Reddy s Laboratories, Ltd DRL triggered by the FDA s acceptance of the NDA for Emrosi in March 2024. In addition, Emrosi launch related expenses were an incremental 0.8 million from the same period in 2023 as a result of the commencement of our product launch efforts in 2024. These increases were offset, in part, by 4.3 million of lower clinical trial expenses to develop Emrosi compared to the same period in 2023, as the clinical phase of the project has concluded. Selling, General and Administrative SG A expenses decreased by 3.9 million, or 12 , to 30.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 34.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to our continued expense management efforts, offset by non-cash share-based compensation, the expansion of our access and coverage platforms and the commencement of our launch efforts for Emrosi. SG A related to our continued expense management efforts, primarily in sales and marketing and other SG A areas, decreased by 7.6 million compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is partially offset by a 1.4 million increase in SG A expenses from period-to-period due to the expansion of our access and coverage platforms, and the commencement of our launch efforts for Emrosi related mainly to market research and access and corporate headcount. In addition, non-cash share-based compensation expense increased by 2.3 million compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of an increase in outstanding equity awards from period-to-period. Interest Income Interest income increased by 0.4 million compared to the same period in 2023. Interest income reflects the income earned on our high yield money market account. The increase is due to a higher invested balance compared to the prior year resulting from entering into the SWK Credit Facility in December 2023, and to a lesser extent, a slight increase in investment yield. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by 0.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. In July 2023, we satisfied all of our outstanding debt obligations with EWB by voluntarily repaying the outstanding balance on our term loan under the Loan and Security Agreement with EWB. As such, we had no additional debt or borrowing of funds, and therefore incurred only minimal interest expense until entering into the Credit Facility with SWK in December of 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources At September 30, 2024, we had 22.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to 27.4 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023. On December 27, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with SWK Funding LLC SWK ). The Credit Agreement originally provided for a term loan facility (the Credit Facility in the original principal amount of up to 20.0 million. On the closing date, we drew 15.0 million. On June 26, 2024, we drew the then remaining 5.0 million under the Credit Facility. Loans under the Credit Facility (the Term Loans mature on December 27, 2027, and bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the three-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (subject to a SOFR floor of 5 plus 7.75 .

 outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 7.5 of the principal amount of funded Term Loans. The SWK Credit Facility also includes both revenue and liquidity covenants, restrictions as to payment of dividends, and is secured by substantially all assets of the Company. As of June 30, 2023, and as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the SWK Credit Facility. On July 9, 2024, we entered into an amendment (the Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment increased the original principal amount of the Credit Facility from 20.0 million to 25.0 million. The 5.0 million of additional principal added in the Amendment is contractually required to be drawn upon FDA approval of Emrosi, subject to receiving approval on or before June 30, 2025. The approval of Emrosi by the FDA triggered the requirement to draw on the remaining 5.0 million under the Credit Facility. As of the date of issuance of these financial statements, we have not drawn on this amount. The FDA approval also triggered a 15.0 million milestone payment obligation to DRL that is due 30 days after the FDA approval. (See Note 19, to the consolidated financial statements, Subsequent Events , for further information regarding current contingent regulatory milestone payments to DRL pursuant to the DFD 29 Agreement). On December 30, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-269079), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on January 26, 2023. This shelf registration statement covers the offering, issuance and sale of up to an aggregate of 150.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and units (the 2022 Shelf ). In connection with the 2022 Shelf, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement relating to shares of our common stock. We may offer and sell up to 4,900,000 shares of our common stock, from time to time, under the Sales Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued and sold 325,019 shares of common stock under the 2022 Shelf, generating net proceeds of 1.7 million. At September 30, 2024, 3,826,278 shares remain available for issuance under the 2022 Shelf. On September 19, 2024, the United Stated District Court Southern District of New York through the United States Marshalls notified us that it has recovered and will be returning to the Company a portion of the misappropriated cash in connection with the previously disclosed September 2021 cybersecurity incident. We regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and financing alternatives, including out-licensing arrangements for our products to enhance our capital structure. We may seek to raise capital through debt or equity financings to expand our product portfolio and for other strategic initiatives, which may include sales of securities under either the 2022 Shelf or a new registration statement. Additionally, since we received FDA approval for Emrosi on November 4, 2024, we are required to draw on the remaining 5.0 million under the SWK Credit Facility on or before June 30, 2025. We cannot make any assurances that such additional financing will be available and, if available, the terms may negatively impact the Company s business and operations. Our expectations are based on current assumptions, projected commercial sales of our products, clinical development plans and regulatory submission timelines, which may be uncertain and may not emerge as expected. Additionally, as a result of recurring losses, substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.

Cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 includes cash received pursuant to the Maruho Agreement, where Maruho paid us 19.0 million as a non-refundable upfront payment. Additionally, in 2024 we made cash payments of 4.1 million related to the filing fee paid to the FDA for Emrosi in January 2024 and 3.0 million for the contractual milestone payment owed DRL triggered by the FDA s acceptance of the NDA for Emrosi in March 2024. The remainder was driven primarily by the changes in net working capital.

 Investing Activities The nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 reflects the 5.0 million deferred cash payment paid in January 2023 related to the Vyne Product Acquisition. Financing Activities Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 6.4 million compared to 24.0 million of net cash flows used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a change of 30.4 million from period-to-period. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 reflects the draw of an additional 5.0 million under the SWK Credit Facility in June of 2024, as well as the net proceeds from issuances of common stock under the Sales Agreement of 1.7 million as compared to the paydown of our prior letter of credit and debt facility in the prior year period. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 reflects the voluntarily repayment the outstanding balance on our term loan under the Loan and Security Agreement with EWB. Material Cash Requirements In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that contain cash requirements of which the most significant currently include the following: We are required to make regular payments under the SWK Credit Facility. Based on the amount currently outstanding under the SWK facility and current interest rates, and assuming we do not make further draws under the SWK facility, we expect to make the following payments: 

Payments by Period Remainder of Total 2024 2025 2026 2027 's in thousands) Interest 6,971 664 2,634 2,237 1,436 Principal 20,000 6,000 14,000 Exit fee 1,000 1,000 Total 27,971 664 2,634 8,237 16,436 Excluded from the above table is an additional 5.0 million under the SWB Credit Facility that is contractually required to be drawn upon FDA approval of Emrosi, subject to receiving approval on or before June 30, 2025. The approval of Emrosi by the FDA triggered the requirement to draw on the remaining 5.0 million under the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Vyne Product Acquisition Agreement, upon the achievement of net sales milestones with respect to the products purchased in the Vyne Product Acquisition, we are also required to pay contingent consideration consisting of a one-time payment, per product, of 10.0 million and 20.0 million upon each product reaching annual net sales of 100 million and 200 million, respectively. Each required payment must only be paid one time following the first achievement of the applicable annual net sales milestone amount. On June 29, 2021, we entered into the DFD-29 Agreement to obtain the global rights for the development and commercialization of Emrosi with DRL. Based on the development and commercialization of Emrosi, additional contingent regulatory and commercial milestone payments totaling up to 140.0 million, which excludes the 15.0 million milestone payment triggered by FDA approval on November 4, 2024, may also become payable. (See Note 19, to the consolidated financial statements, Subsequent Events , for further information regarding current contingent regulatory milestone payments to DRL pursuant to the DFD 29 Agreement). Royalties ranging from ten percent to twenty percent are payable on net sales of the product. In January 2024, we paid a 4.0 million filing fee to the FDA upon filing of an NDA for Emrosi. We made a 3.0 million contractual milestone payment to DRL in April 2024 based on the FDA s acceptance of our NDA for Emrosi filed in January 2024. On November 4, 2024, we received FDA approval for Emrosi, which triggered a 15.0 million milestone payment obligation to DRL, that is due 30 days after FDA approval. In August 2024, we executed a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement to settle amounts owed by us to Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. Sun pursuant to the Ximino Asset Purchase Agreement. We owed 3.0 million of license

Table of Contents 
 installment payments to Sun associated with the license of Ximino. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we agreed to settle the total outstanding obligation owed to Sun for a total of 1.9 million, payable in three installments: i) 625.0 thousand upon execution of the Settlement Agreement, ii) 625.0 thousand on December 1, 2024, and iii) 625.0 thousand on January 15, 2025. 
 We are contractually obligated to make sales-based royalty payments to Dermira (for Qbrexza), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (for Exelderm) and PuraCap Caribe (for Targadox). Due to the contingent nature of these obligations, the amounts of these payments cannot be reasonably predicted. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of June 30, 2024, of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the most recent quarter with respect to our operations; which materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

2.5 Loan Accounting . 2.5.1 Recordkeeping . Agent, on behalf of each Lender, shall record in its records the date and amount of the Loan made by each Lender, each prepayment and repayment thereof. The aggregate unpaid principal amount so recorded shall be final, binding and conclusive absent manifest error. The failure to so record any such amount or any error in so recording any such amount shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the Obligations of Borrower hereunder or under any Note to repay the principal amount of the Loans hereunder, together with all interest accruing thereon. 2.5.2 Notes . At the request of any Lender, the Loan of such Lender shall be evidenced by a Note, with appropriate insertions, payable to such Lender in a face principal amount equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Term Loan Share and payable in such amounts and on such dates as are set forth herein. 2.6 Payment of Interest . 2.6.1 Interest Rates . (a) The outstanding principal balance under the Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate of interest equal to the Contract Rate (as may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 2.6.1 ). The Contract Rate applicable to the period beginning on the Closing Date through the date that is one (1) day immediately prior to the initial Payment Date shall be calculated based on the Term SOFR Rate as of the Closing Date. Whenever, on or subsequent to the initial Payment Date, the Term SOFR Rate is increased or decreased (as determined on the date that is ten(10) Business Days prior to each Payment Date), the Contract Rate, as set forth herein, shall be similarly changed effective as of such subsequent Payment Date, without notice or demand of any kind by an amount equal to the amount of such change in the Term SOFR Rate on the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to each such Payment Date. The interest due on the principal balance of the Loan outstanding as of any Payment Date shall be computed for the actual number of days elapsed during the period in question on the basis of a year consisting of three hundred sixty (360) days and shall be calculated by determining the daily principal balance outstanding for each day of such period in question. The daily rate shall be equal to 1/360th times the Contract Rate. If any statement furnished by Agent for the amount of a payment due exceeded the actual amount that should have been paid because the Term SOFR Rate decreased and such decrease was not reflected in such statement, Borrower shall make the payment specified in such statement from Agent and Borrower shall receive a credit for the overpayment, which credit shall be applied towards the next subsequent payment due hereunder. If any statement furnished by Agent for the amount of a payment due was less than the actual amount that should have been paid because the Term SOFR Rate increased and such increase was not reflected in such statement, Borrower shall make the payment specified in such statement from Agent and Borrower shall be required to pay any resulting underpayment with the next subsequent payment due hereunder. (b) Borrower recognizes and acknowledges that any default on any payment, or portion thereof, due hereunder or to be made under any of the other Loan Documents, will result in losses and additional expenses to Agent in servicing the Loan, and in losses due to Lenders loss of the use of funds not timely received.

Therefore, upon the Term Loan Maturity Date and/or upon the occurrence and during the existence of an 

-17- [JOURNEY] CREDIT AGREEMENT 

Event of Default (or upon any acceleration), interest shall automatically accrue hereunder, without notice to Borrower, at the Default Rate. The Default Rate shall be calculated and due from the date that the Event of Default occurred and shall be payable upon demand.

To the extent lawful, the interest and charges that would have been paid in respect of such Loan but were not paid as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest (if any) and charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the amount collectible at the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for each day to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender. Any amount collected by such Lender that exceeds the maximum amount collectible at the Maximum Rate shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of such Loan or refunded to the Borrower so that at no time shall the interest (if any) and charges paid or payable in respect of such Loan exceed the maximum amount collectible at the Maximum Rate. 2.6.2 Payments of Interest and Principal . Borrower shall pay to Lenders all accrued interest on the Loan in arrears on each Payment Date, upon a prepayment of such Loan in accordance with Section 2.8 and at maturity in cash.
