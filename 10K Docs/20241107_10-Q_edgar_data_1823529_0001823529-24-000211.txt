 We are engaged in the business of writing and assuming residential mortgage guaranty insurance. The insurance protects lenders and investors against certain losses resulting from nonpayment of loans secured by mortgages, deeds of trust, or other instruments constituting a lien on residential real estate. We offer private mortgage insurance products predominantly insuring prime-based, individually underwritten residential mortgage loans primary mortgage insurance ). Our primary mortgage insurance enables borrowers to buy homes with a down payment of less than 20 of the home s value. Primary mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these low down payment mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market, most of which are sold to government-sponsored enterprises. We also selectively enter into insurance transactions with lenders and investors, under which we insure a portfolio of loans at or after origination. 
 We also perform fee-based contract underwriting services for mortgage lenders. The provision of underwriting services by mortgage insurers eliminates the duplicative lender and mortgage insurer underwriting activities and expedites the approval process. 
 We operate our business through our primary insurance subsidiary, Enact Mortgage Insurance Corporation, EMICO ), formerly known as Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation, with operations in all states and the District of Columbia. EMICO is an approved insurer by the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises, and we refer to them collectively as the GSEs. 
 We also offer mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance through our wholly owned Bermuda-based subsidiary, Enact Re Ltd. ("Enact Re"). We contributed million into Enact Re during 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Enact Re reinsured EMICO s new and existing insurance in-force under quota share reinsurance agreements and invests in new business opportunities for Enact, including assumption of excess of loss reinsurance relating to GSE risk share. 
 We operate our business in a single segment, which is how our chief operating decision maker (who is our Chief Executive Officer) reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. Our segment includes a run-off insurance block with reference properties in Mexico run-off business ), which is immaterial to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ). Preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary by management to present a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results reported in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should not be regarded as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year.

 We did not recognize an allowance for credit losses on securities in an unrealized loss position included in the table above. Based on a qualitative and quantitative review of the issuers of the securities, we believe the unrealized losses are largely due to changes in interest rates and recent market volatility and are not indicative of credit losses. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments. 
 For all securities in an unrealized loss position without an allowance for credit losses, we expect to recover the amortized cost based on our estimate of the amount and timing of cash flows to be collected. We do not intend to sell, nor do we expect that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovering our amortized cost.

A summary of the inputs used for our fixed maturity securities and short-term investments based on the level in which instruments are classified is included below. We have combined certain classes of instruments together as the nature of the inputs is similar. 
 Level 1 measurements 
 There were fixed maturity securities classified as Level 1 as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 Level 2 measurements 
 Fixed maturity securities: 
 Third-party pricing services 
 In estimating the fair value of fixed maturity securities, approximately of our portfolio was priced using third-party pricing services as of September 30, 2024. These pricing services utilize industry-standard valuation techniques that include market-based approaches, income-based approaches, a combination of market-based and income-based approaches or other proprietary, internally generated models as part of the valuation processes. These third-party pricing vendors maximize the use of publicly available data inputs to generate valuations for each asset class. Priority and type of inputs used may change frequently as certain inputs may be more direct drivers of valuation at the time of pricing. Examples of significant inputs incorporated by pricing services may include sector and issuer spreads, seasoning, capital structure, security optionality, collateral data, prepayment assumptions, default assumptions, delinquencies, debt covenants, benchmark yields, trade data, dealer quotes, credit ratings, maturity and weighted-average life. We conduct regular meetings with our pricing services for the purpose of understanding the methodologies, techniques and inputs used by the third-party pricing providers.

 million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. Internally modeled securities are primarily private fixed maturity securities where we use market observable inputs such as an interest rate yield curve, published credit spreads for similar securities based on the external ratings of the instrument and related industry sector of the issuer. Additionally, we may apply certain price caps and liquidity premiums in the valuation of private fixed maturity securities. Price caps and liquidity premiums are established using inputs from market participants. 
 Short-term investments: 
 The fair value of short-term investments classified as Level 2 is determined after considering prices obtained by pricing services. 
 Level 3 measurements 
 Broker quotes 
 A portion of our non-U.S. corporate and other asset-backed securities are valued using broker quotes. Broker quotes are obtained from third-party providers that have current market knowledge to provide a reasonable price for securities not routinely priced by pricing services. Brokers utilized for valuation of assets are reviewed annually. The fair value of our Level 3 fixed maturity securities priced by broker quotes was million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Internal models 
 A portion of our U.S. corporate and non-U.S. corporate securities are valued using internal models. The primary inputs to the valuation of the bond population include quoted prices for identical assets, or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, duration, call provisions, issuer rating, benchmark yields and credit spreads. Certain private fixed maturity securities are valued using an internal model using market observable inputs such as the interest rate yield curve, as well as published credit spreads for similar securities, which includes significant unobservable inputs. Additionally, we may apply certain price caps and liquidity premiums in the valuation of private fixed maturity securities. Price caps are established using inputs from market participants. For structured securities, the primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical assets, or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, weighted-average coupon, weighted-average maturity, issuer rating, structure of the security, expected prepayment speeds and volumes, collateral type, current and forecasted loss severity, average delinquency rates, vintage of the loans, geographic region, debt service coverage ratios, payment priority with the tranche, benchmark yields and credit spreads.

 The liability for loss reserves represents our current best estimate; however, there may be future adjustments to this estimate and related assumptions. Such adjustments, reflecting any variety of new and adverse trends, could possibly be significant, and result in future increases to reserves by amounts that could be material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 Losses incurred related to insured events of the current accident year relate to defaults that occurred in that year and represent the estimated ultimate amount of losses to be paid on such defaults. Losses incurred related to insured events of prior accident years represent the (favorable) or unfavorable development of reserves as a result of the actual rates at which delinquencies go to claim claim rates and claim amounts being different than those we estimated when originally establishing the reserves. These estimates are based on our historical experience, which we believe is representative of expected future losses at the time of estimation. As a result of the extended period of time that may exist between the reporting of a delinquency and the claim payment, as well as changes in economic conditions and the real estate market, significant uncertainty and variability exist on amounts ultimately paid. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, losses and LAE incurred of million related to insured events of the current accident year was primarily attributable to new delinquencies compared to million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also recorded favorable reserve adjustments of million primarily on prior accident year reserves, driven by cure performance of delinquencies from 2023 and prior. As part of the reserve adjustments in 2024, we decreased our claim rate assumptions for new and existing delinquencies as a result of sustained favorable cure performance and lessening uncertainty in the economic environment, which impacted reserves from current and prior accident years.

 The difference between written premiums of million and earned premiums of million represents the decrease in unearned premiums for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The difference between written premiums of million and earned premiums of million represents the decrease in unearned premiums for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In both periods, the decrease in unearned premiums was primarily the result of premiums earned over time coupled with low originations of our single premium mortgage insurance product. 
 Excess-of-loss reinsurance 
 We engage in excess-of-loss XOL insurance transactions either through a panel of traditional reinsurance providers or through collateralized reinsurance with unaffiliated special purpose insurers Triangle Re Entities ). During the respective coverage periods of these agreements, EMICO retains the first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies while the reinsurer provides the second layer of coverage, up to the defined reinsurance coverage amount. EMICO retains losses in excess of the respective reinsurance coverage amount. 
 The Triangle Re Entities fully collateralize their coverage by issuing insurance-linked notes ILNs to eligible capital market investors in unregistered private offerings. Traditional reinsurance providers collateralize a portion of their coverage by holding funds in trust. We believe that the risk transfer requirements for reinsurance accounting were met as these XOL insurance transactions assume significant insurance risk and a reasonable possibility of significant loss.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report ). 
 In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements above and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report. Future results could differ significantly from the historical results presented in this section. References to EHI, Enact, Enact Holdings, the Company, we or our herein are, unless the context otherwise requires, to EHI on a consolidated basis. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Results 
 There have been no material changes to the factors affecting our results, as compared to those disclosed in the Annual Report, other than the impact of items as discussed below in Trends and Conditions. 
 
 Trends and Conditions 
 Macroeconomic environment. During the third quarter of 2024, the United States economy has continued to show positive signs, but faces lingering uncertainty due to inflationary pressure, the geopolitical environment and macroeconomic concerns. 
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in September 2024 that the Consumer Price Index CPI was 2.4 year-over-year compared to 3.0 year-over-year in June 2024. Despite CPI improvement, inflationary pressures have remained a challenge. The Federal Reserve took an aggressive approach towards addressing inflation throughout 2022 and into 2023. After a period of no interest rate changes in late 2023 and early 2024, the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024. Mortgage rates remain elevated but have declined compared to highs in late 2023. 
 Mortgage origination activity has increased modestly in 2024 but remains relatively slow in response to elevated mortgage rates and sustained low housing supply. Over the past few years, housing affordability has deteriorated as elevated mortgage rates and home price appreciation outpaced median family income according to the National Association of Realtors Housing Affordability Index. National house prices continued to rise into 2024 according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA Monthly Purchase-Only House Price Index. 
 The unemployment rate as of September 30, 2024, was 4.1 , flat from June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the number of unemployed Americans stood at approximately 6.8 million and the number of long-term unemployed Americans (over 26 weeks out of the workforce) was approximately 1.6 million. 
 Forbearance and loss mitigation programs. Borrowers ability to utilize extended forbearance timelines permitted through the CARES Act and GSE COVID-19 servicing-related policies ended in 2023. Borrowers that meet general hardship and program guidelines continue to have access to standard forbearance policies as a loss mitigation option. Additionally, in March 2023, the GSEs announced new loss mitigation programs that allow six-month payment deferrals for borrowers facing financial hardship. 
 Although it is difficult to predict the future level of reported forbearance and how many of the policies in a forbearance plan that remain current on their monthly mortgage payment will go delinquent, servicer-reported forbearances have generally declined. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1.0 , or 9,987, 
 33 

of our active primary policies were reported in a forbearance plan, of which approximately 28 were reported as delinquent. Approximately 9 of our primary new delinquencies in the third quarter of 2024 were subject to a forbearance plan as compared to 12 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Regulatory developments. Private mortgage insurance market penetration and eventual market size are affected in part by actions that impact housing or housing finance policy taken by the GSEs and the U.S. government, including but not limited to, the Federal Housing Administration FHA and the FHFA. In the past, these actions have included announced changes, or potential changes, to underwriting standards, including changes to the GSEs automated underwriting systems, FHA pricing, GSE guaranty fees, loan limits and alternative products. 
 On October 24, 2022, the FHFA announced the validation and approval of both the FICO 10T credit score model and the VantageScore 4.0 credit score model for anticipated use by the GSEs as well as proposing to change the requirement that lenders provide credit reports from all three nationwide consumer reporting agencies and instead only requiring credit reports from two of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies. The validation of the new credit scores is currently expected to require lenders to deliver both credit scores for each loan sold to the GSEs. In February 2024, the FHFA announced preliminary implementation in the fourth quarter of 2025. Implementation will require system and process updates along with coordination across stakeholders of the industry. 
 On August 21, 2024, the GSEs and the FHFA released updated PMIERs requirements that will be phased in between March 31, 2025 and September 30, 2026. The updated standards differentiate between bonds based on credit quality and liquidity. The updates also establish limits for assets backed by residential mortgages or commercial real estate to mitigate the impact if such assets lose value during periods of housing stress. We expect to hold capital sufficiency well in excess of these requirements and do not expect the impact of these updates to be material to our sufficiency. The ultimate impact of the PMIERs changes will be influenced by investment portfolio maturities, dispositions, reinvestments, and overall business and economic performance between today and the phase-in dates. 
 Competitive environment. The U.S. private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our market share is influenced by the execution of our go to market strategy, including but not limited to, pricing competitiveness relative to our peers and our selective participation in forward commitment transactions. We continue to manage the quality of new business through pricing and our underwriting guidelines, which are modified from time to time when circumstances warrant. We see the market and underwriting conditions, including the pricing environment, as being within our risk-adjusted return appetite enabling us to write new business at attractive returns. Ultimately, we expect our new insurance written with its strong credit profile and attractive pricing to positively contribute to our future profitability and return on equity. 
 Our portfolio. New insurance written NIW of 13.6 billion in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 6 compared to the third quarter of 2023 driven by lower estimated market share. Our primary persistency rate was 83 during the third quarter of 2024 and 84 for the third quarter of 2023. The persistency rate remains higher than historical levels driven by a large percentage of our in-force policies with mortgage rates below current mortgage rates. Elevated persistency has continued to offset lower new insurance written, leading to an increase in primary insurance in-force IIF of approximately 5.1 billion since December 31, 2023. 
 Net earned premiums increased approximately 2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily as a result of insurance in-force growth and higher assumed premiums, consisting primarily of Enact Re s GSE credit risk transfer participation, partially offset by higher ceded premiums. 
 Loss experience. Our loss ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 5 as compared to 7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Both periods were impacted by favorable reserve development. In the third quarter of 2024, we released 65 million of reserves, driven 
 34 

by cure performance of delinquencies from 2023 and prior. This compares to the third quarter of 2023, where we recorded a 55 million reserve release primarily related to favorable cure performance on delinquencies from 2022 and earlier, including those as a result of COVID-19. 
 The severity of loss on loans that go to claim may be negatively impacted by the extended forbearance and foreclosure timelines, the associated elevated expenses and the higher loan amount of the recent new delinquencies. These negative influences on loss severity could be mitigated, in part, by embedded home price appreciation. For loans insured on or after October 1, 2014, our mortgage insurance policies limit the number of months of unpaid interest and associated expenses that are included in the mortgage insurance claim amount to a maximum of 36 months. 
 New delinquencies in the third quarter of 2024 increased compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to aging of our large, newer books. Current period primary delinquencies of 12,964 contributed 75 million of loss expense in the third quarter of 2024. We incurred 72 million of losses from 11,107 delinquencies that were reported in the third quarter of 2023. In determining the loss expense estimate, considerations were given to recent cure and claim experience and the prevailing and prospective economic conditions. 
 Capital requirements and ratings. As of September 30, 2024, EMICO s risk-to-capital ratio under North Carolina law and enforced by the North Carolina Department of Insurance NCDOI ), EMICO s domestic insurance regulator, was approximately 10.4:1, compared with a risk-to-capital ratio of 11.6:1 as of both December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively. EMICO s risk-to-capital ratio remains below the NCDOI s maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25:1. North Carolina s calculation of risk-to-capital excludes the risk in-force for delinquent loans given the established loss reserves against all delinquencies. EMICO s ongoing risk-to-capital ratio will depend principally on the magnitude of future losses incurred by EMICO, the effectiveness of ongoing loss mitigation activities, new business volume and profitability, the impact of quota share reinsurance, the amount of policy lapses and the amount of additional capital that is generated or distributed by the business. 
 Under PMIERs, we are subject to operational and financial requirements that private mortgage insurers must meet in order to remain eligible to insure loans that are purchased by the GSEs. As of September 30, 2024, we had estimated available assets of 5,194 million against 3,004 million net required assets under PMIERs compared to available assets of 5,024 million against 2,967 million net required assets as of June 30, 2024. The sufficiency ratio as of September 30, 2024, was 173 , or 2,190 million, above the PMIERs requirements, compared to 169 , or 2,057 million, above the PMIERs requirements as of June 30, 2024. Our PMIERs required assets benefited from a reinsurance credit of 1,807 million and 1,756 million related to third-party reinsurance as of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, respectively. Our PMIERs required assets as of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, also benefited from the application of a 0.30 multiplier applied to the risk-based required asset amount factor for certain non-performing loans as defined under PMIERs. The application of the 0.30 multiplier to all eligible delinquencies provided 28 million of benefit to our September 30, 2024 PMIERs required assets compared to 31 million of benefit as of June 30, 2024. These amounts are gross of any incremental reinsurance benefit from the elimination of the 0.30 multiplier. Per guidance released by the GSEs in the third quarter of 2024, use of the multiplier will be discontinued effective March 31, 2025. 
 On January 8, 2024, S P Global Ratings upgraded the long-term financial strength and issuer credit ratings of EMICO from BBB+ to A-. 
 35 

Recent transactions. In November 2023, we contributed 250 million into Enact Re, our wholly owned Bermuda-based subsidiary. This contribution supported the increase to the ceding percentage of our previously announced affiliate quota share agreements from 7.5 to 12.5 during the first quarter of 2024, and a new quota share reinsurance agreement that cedes 12.5 of EMICO s 2024 new insurance written. The contribution also supports new business opportunities, which primarily includes the continued execution of GSE credit risk transfer. 
 On January 3, 2024, we entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement with a panel of third-party reinsurers. Under the agreement, EMICO will cede approximately 21 of a portion of its new insurance written from January 1, 2024, though December 31, 2024. 
 On January 30, 2024, we executed an excess-of-loss reinsurance transaction with a panel of reinsurers, which provides up to 255 million of reinsurance coverage on a portion of current and expected new insurance written for the 2024 book year, effective January 1, 2024. 
 On May 28, 2024, we issued our 2029 Notes for an aggregate principal amount of 750 million. We used the proceeds from the issuance to redeem our 2025 Notes. 
 On June 25, 2024, we executed an excess-of-loss reinsurance transaction with a panel of reinsurers, which provides approximately 90 million of reinsurance coverage on a portion of existing mortgage insurance written from July 1, 2023, through December 31, 2023, effective June 1, 2024. 
 Capital returns. In March 2024, our primary mortgage insurance operating company, EMICO, completed a distribution to EHI that supports our ability to pay a quarterly dividend. We paid a dividend of 0.16 per common share during the first quarter of 2024. On May 1, 2024, we also announced an increase to our quarterly dividend to 0.185 per common share which was paid in June and September 2024. Future dividend payments are subject to quarterly review and approval by our Board of Directors and Genworth and will be targeted to be paid in the third month of each quarter. 
 On May 1, 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to 250 million of EHI s common stock. Under the program, share repurchases may be made at our discretion from time to time in open market transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. In conjunction with this authorization, we have entered into an agreement with Genworth Holdings, Inc. to repurchase its EHI shares on a pro rata basis as part of the program. The share repurchase program is not expected to materially change Genworth s ownership interest in Enact post-completion. We expect the timing and amount of any future share repurchases will be opportunistic and will depend on a variety of factors, including EHI s share price, capital availability, business and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and debt covenant restrictions. The program does not obligate EHI to acquire any amount of common stock, it may be suspended or terminated at any time at the Company s discretion without prior notice, and it does not have a specified expiration date. 
 Returning capital to shareholders, balanced with our growth and risk management priorities, remains a priority as we look to drive shareholder value through time. Future return of capital will be shaped by our capital prioritization framework, which sets the following priorities: supporting our existing policyholders, growing our mortgage insurance business, funding attractive new business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Our total return of capital will also be based on our view of the prevailing and prospective macroeconomic conditions, regulatory landscape and business performance.

 Revenues 
 Premiums increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of insurance in-force growth and increased assumed premiums, consisting primarily of Enact Re s GSE credit risk transfer participation, partially offset by higher ceded premiums. The net earned premium rate was 0.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down slightly from 0.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net investment income increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher yields as a result of elevated interest rates coupled with higher average invested assets. 
 37 

Net investment losses in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were driven by realized losses on the sale of fixed maturity securities. 
 Losses and expenses 
 Losses incurred during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were both impacted by prior year development. In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a reserve release of 65 million, driven by cure performance of delinquencies from 2023 and prior. In the third quarter of 2023, we recorded a reserve release of 55 million primarily related to better than expected cure performance on delinquencies from 2022 and earlier, including a portion of those as a result of COVID-19. A component of the reserve release also related to delinquencies from 2022, as uncertainty in the economic environment had not negatively impacted cure performance to the extent initially expected. Current period primary delinquencies of 12,964 contributed 75 million of loss expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024. This compares to 72 million of loss expense from 11,107 primary delinquencies in the third quarter of 2023.

 Provision for income taxes 
 The effective tax rate was 21.3 and 23.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The tax rate in the third quarter of 2023 was impacted by the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets associated with realized losses on fixed maturity securities during 2023.

 Revenues 
 Premiums increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to insurance in-force growth and higher assumed premiums, consisting primarily of Enact Re s GSE credit risk transfer participation, partially offset by higher ceded premiums. The net earned premium rate was 0.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down slightly from 0.37 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net investment income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in investment yields in the current year and higher average invested assets. 
 Net investment losses in both periods were driven by the sale of fixed income securities as part of an investment strategy designed to optimize yield on our portfolio over time. Our yield optimization strategy enables opportunistic security sales based on current and changing market conditions. 
 39 

Losses and expenses 
 Losses incurred during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were both impacted by favorable reserve adjustments. During the first nine months of 2024, we released reserves of 196 million primarily on prior accident year reserves driven by cure performance of delinquencies from 2023 and prior. As part of the 2024 reserve adjustments, we decreased our claim rate assumptions for new and existing delinquencies as a result of sustained favorable cure performance and lessening uncertainty in the economic environment, which impacted reserves from current and prior accident years. During the first nine months of 2023, we released reserves of 188 million primarily due to better than expected cure experience on delinquencies from 2022 and earlier, including a portion of those related to the emergence of COVID-19. New primary delinquencies of 34,820 contributed 209 million of loss expense in the first nine months of 2024. This compares to 188 million of loss expense from 29,911 new primary delinquencies in the first nine months of 2023.

 Provision for income taxes 
 The effective tax rate was 21.6 and 22.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consistent with the United States corporate federal income tax rate. 
 
 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use a non-U.S. GAAP non-GAAP financial measure entitled adjusted operating income. This non-GAAP financial measure aligns with the way our business performance is evaluated by both management and our Board of Directors. This measure has been established in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our core operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with our peers. Although adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the reasons discussed above we believe this measure aids in understanding the underlying performance of our operations. Our senior management, including our chief operating decision maker (who is our Chief Executive Officer), use adjusted operating income as the primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of our business and to allocate resources. 
 40 

Adjusted operating income is defined as U.S. GAAP net income excluding the effects of (i) net investment gains (losses), (ii) restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items, and (iii) gains (losses) on the extinguishment of debt. 
 (i) Net investment gains (losses) The recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the activity is highly discretionary based on the timing of individual securities sales due to such factors as market opportunities or exposure management. Trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these realized gains and losses. We do not view them to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities. Therefore, these items are excluded from our calculation of adjusted operating income. 
 (ii) Restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items are also excluded from adjusted operating income if, in our opinion, they are not indicative of overall operating trends. 
 (iii) Gains (losses) on the extinguishment of debt are also excluded from adjusted operating income, as we do not view them to be indicative of overall operating trends. 
 In reporting non-GAAP measures in the future, we may make other adjustments for expenses and gains we do not consider reflective of core operating performance in a particular period. We may disclose other non-GAAP operating measures if we believe that such a presentation would be helpful for investors to evaluate our operating condition by including additional information. 
 Adjusted operating income is not a measure of total profitability, and therefore should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income. Our definition of adjusted operating income may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies, including our peers. 
 Adjustments to reconcile net income to adjusted operating income assume a 21 tax rate (unless otherwise indicated). 
 The following table includes a reconciliation of net income to adjusted operating income for the periods indicated: 
 Three months ended September 30, (Amounts in thousands) 
 2024 2023 Net income 180,669 164,195 Adjustments to net income: Net investment (gains) losses 1,243 23 Costs associated with reorganization 848 3 Taxes on adjustments (439) (5) Adjusted operating income 182,321 164,216 
 Adjusted operating income increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in premiums and net investment income, coupled with a larger reserve release in the third quarter of 2024.

 Adjusted operating income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to September 30, 2023, primarily due to premium and net investment income growth, partially offset by higher losses.

 Insurance in-force IIF and Risk in-force RIF 
 IIF increased as a result of NIW. Elevated interest rates and the low refinance market leading to lower lapse and cancellations during the third quarter of 2024 drove continued elevated persistency. The primary persistency rate was 83 and 84 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. RIF increased primarily as a result of higher IIF.

Delinquent loans and claims 
 Our delinquency management process begins with notification by the loan servicer of a delinquency on an insured loan. Delinquency is defined in our master policies as the borrower s failure to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled monthly mortgage payment under the terms of the mortgage. Generally, our master policies require an insured to notify us of a delinquency if the borrower fails to make two consecutive monthly mortgage payments prior to the due date of the next mortgage payment. We generally consider a loan to be delinquent and establish required reserves after the insured notifies us that the borrower has failed to make two scheduled mortgage payments. Borrowers default for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to a reduction of income, unemployment, divorce, illness/death, inability to manage credit, falling home prices and interest rate levels. Borrowers may cure delinquencies by making all of the delinquent loan payments, agreeing to a loan modification, or by selling the property in full satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage. In most cases, delinquencies that are not cured result in a claim under our policy. 
 The following table shows a roll forward of the number of primary loans in default for the periods indicated:

 The number of delinquencies often does not correlate directly with the number of claims received because delinquencies may cure. The rate at which delinquencies cure is influenced by borrowers financial resources and circumstances and regional economic differences. Whether a delinquency leads to a claim correlates highly with the borrower s equity at the time of delinquency, as it influences the borrower s willingness to continue to make payments, the borrower s or the insured s ability to sell the home for an amount sufficient to satisfy all amounts due under the mortgage loan and the borrower s financial ability to continue making payments. When we receive notice of a delinquency, we use our proprietary model to determine whether a delinquent loan is a candidate for a modification. When our model identifies such a candidate, our loan workout specialists prioritize cases for loss mitigation based upon the likelihood that the loan will result in a claim. Loss mitigation actions include loan modification, 
 53 

extension of credit to bring a loan current, foreclosure forbearance, pre-foreclosure sale and deed-in-lieu. These loss mitigation efforts often are an effective way to reduce our claim exposure and ultimate payouts.

Loss reserves in policy years 2008 and prior are outsized compared to their representation of RIF. The size of these policy years at origination, particularly 2005 through 2008, combined with the significant decline in home prices led to significant losses in policy years prior to 2009. Although uncertainty remains with respect to the ultimate losses we will experience on these policy years, they have become a smaller percentage of our total mortgage insurance portfolio. The concentration of loss reserves has shifted to newer book years in line with changes in RIF. As of September 30, 2024, our 2017 and newer policy years represented approximately 96 of our primary RIF and 81 of our total direct primary case reserves. 
 
 Investment Portfolio 
 Our investment portfolio is affected by factors described below, each of which in turn may be affected by current macroeconomic conditions as noted above in Trends and Conditions. The investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries are directed by the Enact Investment Committee, a management-level committee, with Genworth serving as the primary investment manager. The investment portfolio of EHI is directed by a separate management-level EHI Investment Committee with a third-party investment manager. These parties, with oversight from our Board of Directors and our senior management team, are responsible for the execution of our investment strategy. Our investment portfolio is an important component of our consolidated financial results and represents our primary source of claims paying resources. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of a diverse mix of highly rated fixed maturity securities and is designed to achieve the following objectives: 
 Meet policyholder obligations through maintenance of sufficient liquidity; 
 Preserve capital; 
 Generate investment income; 
 Maximize statutory capital; and 
 Increase shareholder value, among other objectives. 
 To achieve our portfolio objectives, our investment strategy focuses primarily on: 
 Our business outlook, including current and expected future investment conditions; 
 Investments selection based on fundamental, research-driven strategies; 
 Diversification across a mix of fixed income, low-volatility investments while actively pursuing strategies to enhance yield; 
 Regular evaluation and optimization of our asset class mix; 
 Continuous monitoring of investment quality, duration, and liquidity; 
 Regulatory capital requirements; and 
 Restriction of investments correlated to the residential mortgage market.

 We manage credit risk by analyzing issuers, transaction structures and any associated collateral. We also manage credit risk through country, industry, sector and issuer diversification and prudent asset allocation practices. 
 We primarily mitigate interest rate risk by employing a buy and hold investment philosophy that seeks to match fixed income maturities with expected liability cash flows in modestly adverse economic scenarios.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Nine months ended September 30, (Amounts in thousands) 
 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 520,132 441,982 Investing activities (183,613) (133,983) Financing activities (278,839) (143,784) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 57,680 164,215 
 Our most significant source of operating cash flows is from premiums received from our insurance policies, while our most significant uses of operating cash flows are generally for claims paid on our insured policies and our operating expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities increased largely due to higher net investment income and premiums. Cash flows from operations were also impacted by changes in reserves and unearned premiums and the timing of tax payments. 
 Investing activities are primarily related to purchases, sales and maturities of our investment portfolio. Net cash used in investing activities increased as a result of purchases of fixed maturity securities outpacing maturities and sales in the current year due to the deployment of operating cash flows. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash flows from financing activities included the issuance of our 2029 Notes and the redemption of our 2025 Notes. Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also included dividends paid of 83 million and share repurchases of 169 million. The amount and timing of future dividends is discussed within Trends and Conditions as well as below. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our cash flows from financing activities included dividends paid of 74 million and share repurchases of 70 million. 
 Capital Resources and Financing Activities 
 We issued our 2029 Notes in the second quarter of 2024 with interest payable semi-annually in arrears in May and November of each year. The 2029 Notes mature on May 28, 2029. We may redeem the 2029 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to April 28, 2029, at our option, by paying an additional premium. At any time on or after April 28, 2029, we may redeem the 2029 Notes, in whole or in part, at our option, at 100 of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2029 Notes contain customary events of default which, subject to certain notice and cure conditions, can result in the acceleration of the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding notes if we breach the terms of the indenture. 
 The proceeds from our 2029 Notes, along with other available cash, were used to redeem our 2025 Notes during the second quarter of 2024. 
 On June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders that provides for a five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility in the initial aggregate principal amount of 200 million. The Facility matures in June 2027, but under certain conditions EHI may need to repay any outstanding amounts and terminate the Facility earlier than the maturity date. We may use borrowings under the Facility for working capital needs and general corporate purposes, including the execution of dividends to our shareholders and capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries. The Facility contains several covenants, including financial covenants relating to minimum net worth, capital and liquidity levels, maximum debt to capitalization level and PMIERs compliance. We are in compliance with all covenants of the Facility and the Facility has remained undrawn through September 30, 2024. 
 57 

We continually evaluate opportunities based upon market conditions to further increase our financial flexibility including through raising additional capital, restructuring or refinancing some or all of our outstanding debt or pursuing other options such as reinsurance or credit risk transfer transactions. There can be no guarantee that any such opportunities will be available on favorable terms or at all. 
 Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends 
 The ability of our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and distributions to us is restricted by certain provisions of North Carolina insurance laws. Our insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends only from unassigned surplus; payments made from sources other than unassigned surplus, such as paid-in and contributed surplus, are categorized as distributions. Notice of all dividends must be submitted to the Commissioner of the NCDOI (the Commissioner within 5 business days after declaration of the dividend, and at least 30 days before payment thereof. No dividend may be paid until 30 days after the Commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and (i) has not within that period disapproved the payment or (ii) has approved the payment within the 30-day period. Any distribution, regardless of amount, requires that same 30-day notice to the Commissioner, but also requires the Commissioner s affirmative approval before being paid. Based on our estimated statutory results and in accordance with applicable dividend restrictions, our insurance subsidiaries have the capacity to pay dividends from unassigned surplus of 223 million as of September 30, 2024, with 30-day advance notice to the Commissioner of the intent to pay. In addition to dividends and distributions, alternative mechanisms, such as share repurchases, subject to any requisite regulatory approvals, may be utilized from time to time to upstream surplus. 
 In addition, we review multiple other considerations in parallel to determine a prospective dividend strategy for our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries. Given the regulatory focus on the reasonableness of an insurer s surplus in relation to its outstanding liabilities and the adequacy of its surplus relative to its financial needs for any dividend, our insurance subsidiaries consider the minimum amount of policyholder surplus after giving effect to any contemplated future dividends. Regulatory minimum policyholder surplus is not codified in North Carolina law and limitations may vary based on prevailing business conditions including, but not limited to, the prevailing and future macroeconomic conditions. We estimate regulators would require a minimum policyholder surplus of approximately 300 million to meet their threshold standard. We are subject to statutory accounting requirements that establish a contingency reserve of at least 50 of net earned premiums annually for ten years, after which time it is released into policyholder surplus. While we began 10-year contingency reserve releases during 2024, minimum policyholder surplus could be a limitation on the future dividends of our regulated operating subsidiaries. 
 Another consideration in the development of the dividend strategies for our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries is our expected level of compliance with PMIERs. Under PMIERs, EMICO is subject to operational and financial requirements that approved insurers must meet in order to remain eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. 
 Our regulated insurance operating subsidiaries are also subject to statutory risk-to-capital RTC requirements that affect the dividend strategies of our regulated operating subsidiaries. EMICO s domiciliary regulator, the NCDOI, requires the maintenance of a statutory RTC ratio not to exceed 25:1. See Risk-to-Capital Ratio for additional RTC trend analysis. 
 We consider potential future dividends compared to the prior year statutory net income in the evaluation of dividend strategies for our regulated operating subsidiaries. We also consider the dividend payout ratio, or the ratio of potential future dividends compared to the estimated U.S. GAAP net income, in the evaluation of our dividend strategies. In either case, we do not have prescribed target or maximum thresholds, but we do evaluate the reasonableness of a potential dividend relative to the actual or estimated income generated in the proceeding or preceding calendar year after giving consideration to prevailing business conditions including, but not limited to the prevailing and future macroeconomic 
 58 

conditions. In addition, the dividend strategies of our regulated operating subsidiaries are made in consultation with Genworth. 
 In March 2024, EMICO completed a distribution of approximately 270 million that will primarily be used to support our ability to return capital to shareholders and bolster financial flexibility. We intend to continue to use future EMICO distributions for these purposes. 
 The credit agreement entered into in connection with the Facility contains customary restrictions on EHI s ability to pay cash dividends. Under the credit agreement, EHI is permitted to make cash distributions (1) so long as no Default or Event of Default (as each are defined in the credit agreement) has occurred and is continuing and EHI is in pro forma compliance with its financial covenants as described below, at the time of and after giving effect to such payment, (2) within 60 days of declaration of any cash dividend so long as the payment was permitted under the credit agreement at the time of such declaration and (3) other customary exceptions as more fully set forth in the credit agreement. 
 The credit agreement requires EHI to maintain the following financial covenants: a minimum consolidated net worth equal to the sum of (i) 72.5 of EHI s consolidated net worth as of June 30, 2022 the Closing Date ), (ii) 50 of EHI s positive consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter after the Closing Date and (iii) 50 of any increase in EHI s consolidated net worth after the Closing Date resulting from equity issuances or capital contributions; in respect of EMICO, a minimum total adjusted capital amount equal to 72.5 of EMICO s total adjusted capital as of the Closing Date; a maximum debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 0.35 to 1.00; a minimum liquidity level of 25,000,000; and compliance with all applicable financial requirements under the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements published by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association. For purposes of determining EHI s compliance with the foregoing financial covenants, the consolidated net worth metric, total adjusted capital metric, debt-to-capitalization ratio and liquidity metric (including, in each case, any component thereof) are each calculated as set forth in the credit agreement. 
 In addition to the restrictions described above, all dividends from EHI are subject to Genworth consent and EHI Board of Directors approval. 
 Risk-to-Capital Ratio 
 We compute our RTC ratio on a separate company statutory basis, as well as for our combined insurance operations. The RTC ratio is net RIF divided by policyholders surplus plus statutory contingency reserve. Our net RIF represents RIF, net of reinsurance ceded, and excludes risk on policies that are currently delinquent and for which loss reserves have been established. Statutory capital consists primarily of statutory policyholders surplus (which increases as a result of statutory net income and decreases as a result of statutory net loss and dividends paid), plus the statutory contingency reserve. The statutory contingency reserve is reported as a liability on the statutory balance sheet. 
 Certain states have insurance laws or regulations that require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital (including the statutory contingency reserve) relative to its level of RIF in order for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. While formulations of minimum capital vary in certain states, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1.

 As of September 30, 2024, we maintained liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents of 673 million compared to 616 million as of December 31, 2023, and we also held significant levels of investment-grade fixed maturity securities and short-term investments that can be monetized should our cash and cash equivalents be insufficient to meet our obligations. 
 On June 30, 2022, we entered into a five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders in the initial aggregate principal amount of 200 million. The Facility matures in June 2027, but under certain conditions EHI may need to repay any outstanding amounts and terminate the Facility earlier than the maturity date. The Facility may be used for working capital needs and general corporate purposes, including the execution of dividends to our shareholders and capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries. The Facility has remained undrawn through September 30, 2024. 
 The principal sources of liquidity in our business currently include insurance premiums, net investment income and cash flows from investment sales and maturities. We believe that the operating cash flows generated by our mortgage insurance subsidiary will provide the funds necessary to satisfy our claim payments, operating expenses and taxes in both the short term and long term. However, our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory and other capital restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends. We currently have no material financing commitments, such as lines of credit or guarantees, that are expected to affect our liquidity, other than the 2029 Notes and the Facility.

 In August 2023, Enact Re was independently assigned a rating of A- by third-party rating organization A.M. Best. In August 2024, Enact Re was independently assigned a rating of A- by S P Global Ratings. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our loss reserves have a high degree of estimation due to macroeconomic uncertainty. Therefore, it is possible we could have higher contractual obligations related to these loss reserves if they do not cure or progress to claim as we expect. Other than changes in our aforementioned loss reserves, there have been no material additions or changes to our contractual obligations or other off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 As of the filing date of this report, there were no material changes in our critical accounting estimates from those discussed in our Annual Report. 
 New Accounting Standards 
 Refer to Note 2 in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and in our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, for a discussion of recently adopted and not yet adopted accounting standards.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We own and manage a large investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. Investment income is one of our material sources of revenue and the investment portfolio represents the primary resource supporting operational and claim payments. The assets within the investment portfolio are exposed to the same factors that affect overall financial market performance. While our investment portfolio is exposed to factors affecting markets worldwide, it is most sensitive to fluctuations in the drivers of United States markets. 
 We manage market risk via our defined investment policy guidelines implemented by our investment managers with oversight from our Board of Directors and our senior management. Important drivers of our market risk exposure that we monitor and manage include but are not limited to: 
 Changes to the level of interest rates . Increasing interest rates may reduce the value of certain fixed-rate bonds held in the investment portfolio. Higher rates may cause variable-rate assets to generate additional income. Decreasing rates will have the reverse impact. Significant changes in interest rates can also affect persistency and claim rates that may require that the investment portfolio be restructured to better align it with future liabilities and claim payments. Such restructuring may cause investments to be liquidated when market conditions are adverse. 
 Changes to the term structure of interest rates . Rising or falling rates typically change by different amounts along the yield curve. These changes may have unforeseen impacts on the value of certain assets. 
 Market volatility/changes in the real or perceived credit quality of investments . Deterioration in the quality of investments, identified through changes to our own or third-party (e.g., rating agency) assessments, will reduce the value and potentially the liquidity of investments. 
 Concentration risk . If the investment portfolio is highly concentrated in one asset, or in multiple assets whose values are highly correlated, the value of the total portfolio may be greatly affected by the change in value of just one asset or a group of highly correlated assets. 
 Prepayment risk . Bonds may have call provisions that permit debtors to repay prior to maturity when it is to their advantage. This typically occurs when rates fall below the interest rate of the debt. 
 Market risk is measured for all investment assets at the individual security level. Market risks that are not fully captured by the quantitative analysis and material market risk changes that occur from the last reporting period to the current are discussed within Trends and conditions and Investment Portfolio in Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 
 As of September 30, 2024, the effective duration of our investments available-for-sale was 3.9 years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift (movement up or down) in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of 3.9 in fair value of our investments available-for-sale. 
 62 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 63 

Part II. Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not subject to any pending material legal proceedings. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We have disclosed within Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report the risk factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report and the other information set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. These risk factors and other information may not describe every risk that we face. The occurrence of any additional risks and uncertainties that are currently immaterial or unknown could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On May 1, 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to 250 million of EHI s common stock. Under the program, share repurchases may be made at the Company s discretion from time to time in open market transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. In conjunction with this authorization, we have entered into an agreement with Genworth Holdings, Inc. to repurchase its EHI shares on a pro rata basis as part of the program. We expect the timing and amount of any future share repurchases will be opportunistic and will depend on a variety of factors, including EHI s share price, capital availability, business and market conditions, regulatory requirements, and debt covenant restrictions. The program does not obligate EHI to acquire any amount of common stock, it may be suspended or terminated at any time at the Company s discretion without prior notice, and it does not have a specified expiration date. 
 The table below sets forth information regarding repurchases of our common shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024:
