Those statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward-looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions. Important factors that could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those projected include, for example:

 our ability to compete with our competitors and increase market share; 
 failure to comply with the financial covenants in our debt facilities; 
 our ability to maintain compliance with rules and regulations applicable to our business operations and industry; 
 disruptions in other card payment processors, software and manufacturing partners upon whom we rely;

 our ability to acquire and develop relevant technology offerings for current, new and potential customers and partners; 
 risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in Europe, Mexico and other foreign markets, including general economic conditions, policy changes affecting international trade, political instability, inflation rates, recessions, sanctions, foreign currency exchange rates and controls, foreign investment and repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints, civil unrest, armed conflict, war, and other economic and political factors; 
 our ability to satisfy our trade obligations included in accounts payable and accrued expenses; 
 our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel, or our loss of the services of our key executives; 
 the incurrence by us of any unanticipated or unusual non-operating expenses, which may require us to divert our cash resources from achieving our business plan;

 our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies into our current products and services structure; 
 our ability to add new customers and retain key existing customers from whom a significant portion of our revenue is derived; 
 the ability of a key customer to reduce or delay purchasing products from us; 
 our ability to obtain widespread commercial acceptance of our products and service offerings; 
 whether any patents issued to us will provide any competitive advantages or adequate protection for our products, or would be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others; 
 the ability of our products and services to avoid disruptions to our systems or unauthorized hacking or credit card fraud; 
 risks associated with cyber-attacks and data breaches; and 
 our ability to maintain effective internal controls and to timely file periodic and current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
 21 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Actual results or business conditions may differ materially from those projected or suggested in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, those described above, or those discussed under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. We cannot assure you that we have identified all the factors that create uncertainties. Moreover, new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all risks on our business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. 
 Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Quarterly Report speaks only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statement to reflect circumstances or events after the date of this Quarterly Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report . 
 
 Key Metrics 
 
 We use certain operating metrics (Active Devices, Active Customers, Total Number of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume, and Average Revenue Per Unit, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin) and certain non-GAAP financial measures (Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA) which are defined below to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. Additionally, refer to the non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for additional information and their reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures. 
 
 Active Devices 
 Active Devices are devices that have communicated with us or have had a transaction in the last twelve months. Included in the number of Active Devices are devices that communicate through other devices that communicate or transact with us. For example, a self-service retail location that utilizes an ePort cashless payment device as well as Seed management services constitutes only one device. 
 
 Active Customers 
 
 The Company defines Active Customers as all customers with at least one active device. 
 
 Total Number of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume of Transactions 
 
 Transactions are defined as electronic payment transactions that are processed by our technology-enabled solutions. Management uses Total Number and Dollar Volume of transactions to evaluate the effectiveness of our new customer strategy and our ability to leverage existing customers and partners. 
 
 Average Revenue Per Unit 
 
 The Company defines average revenue per unit ("ARPU") as our total subscription and transaction fees for the trailing 12 months divided by average total active devices for the trailing 12 months.

24 

Highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 include: 
 Revenues of 70.8 million , an increase of 13.0 quarter over same quarter prior year. The increase was led by higher transaction fees and subsc ription fees revenue; 
 1.23 million Active Devices compared to the same quarter last year of 1.19 million, an increase of approximately 38 thousand Active Devices, or 3.2 ; 
 32,338 Active Customers on our service compared to the same quarter last year of 29,670, an increase of 2,668 Active Customers, or 9.0 ; and 
 826.7 million in Total Dollar Volume of Transactions for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 724.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 101.9 million, or 14.1 . See " Revenues and Gross Margin " in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below for additional information. 
 Revenues. Total revenues increased by 8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in revenues is attributed to a 8.7 million increase in subscription and transaction fees, offset by a 0.5 million decrease in equipment sales. 
 
 The increase in subscription and transaction fees was primarily driven by increased processing volumes and increased average ticket size, resulting in a 14.1 increase in total dollar volumes of transactions for the current fiscal year quarter relative to the same quarter in the prior year. There was also an increase in the total number of active devices relative to the same quarter in the prior year. Our subscription fees have increased 11.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 which is attributed to a continued focus of management to grow our recurring subscription services to our customer base and an increase in our active devices compared to last year. 
 
 Equipment revenue decreased slightly from 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.5 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Costs of sales. Costs of sales increased 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase in costs of sales was primarily due to a 4.0 million increase in subscription and transaction costs as a direct result of increased transaction processing fees corresponding with an increase in processing volumes. 
 
 Gross margin. Total gross margin increased to 38.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 35.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in subscription and transaction fees which yield higher margins compared to equipment fees. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Three months ended September 30, Change 
 Category in thousands) 2024 2023 Amount 
 Percentage 
 Sales and marketing 5,448 4,142 1,306 31.5 Technology and product development 4,499 4,168 331 7.9 General and administrative expenses 11,928 10,438 1,490 14.3 Integration and acquisition expenses 197 78 119 152.6 Depreciation and amortization 2,672 2,747 (75) (2.7) Total operating expenses 24,744 21,573 3,171 14.7 

Total operatin g expenses. Operating expenses increased 14.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This is largely driven by increased sales and market and general and administrative expenses. See further details on individual categories below. 
 
 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to increases in marketing expense of approximately 0.7 million related to international expansion and the acquisition of Cheq, compensation costs of approximately 0.4 million due to increased employee headcount, and travel and entertainment costs of approximately 0.3 million to support our expanding business and service offerings in the United States and internationally. This is offset by a decrease in professional services and contractors of 0.1 million as we continue to hire employees to replace contractors. 
 
 25 

Technology and product development. Technology and product development expenses increased by 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the current year was driven by increased headcount partially offset by lower expensed personnel costs as we continued to invest in internal-use software which resulted in higher capitalized costs compared to the prior year. 
 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a 0.4 million increase as a result of auditor transitions, a 0.3 million increase in legal expenses, a 0.2 million increase compensation costs, a 0.2 million increase in consulting fees, a 0.1 million increase in bad debt expense, and a 0.3 million increase in software subscriptions and other miscellaneous expenses compared to the same period in the 2023 . 
 
 Integration and acquisition expenses. On September 5, 2024, the Company acquired all of the equity interests of SB Software. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred integration and acquisition expenses of 0.2 million primarily due to professional services from accounting and legal advisors and UK taxes. Integration and acquisition expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the acquisition of 32M. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses were consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

 Other expense, net . Other expense decreased 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Our interest expense from debt and tax liabilities decreased 0.1 million primarily due to the reduction of the interest expense related to our outstanding debt balances. Decrease in interest income from cash and leases is primarily due to lower outstanding balances for our finance receivables. Other income (expense), net increased primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not a substitute for or a measure of our profitability or net earnings. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit and Margin (non-GAAP) 
 We define Adjusted Gross Profit (non-GAAP) as revenue less cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation of internally-developed software and amortization of intangible assets related to technologies obtained through acquisitions. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to view the resulting figures excluding the aforementioned non-cash charges because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and such amounts vary substantially from company to company depending on their financing and capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by revenue.

We have provided below a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP gross profit to Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 11.4 12.2 (0.8) Total Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP) 
 40.7 38.8 1.9 (1) Amortization of internal-use software assets and developed technology assets. 
 
 Total Adjusted Gross Margin (non-GAAP) was 40.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , from 38.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in Adjusted Gross Margin was primarily driven by an increase in our subscription fees revenue and transaction which was a higher percentage of our total revenue in the current quarter and is inherently a higher mar gin revenue stream. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) 
 
 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) as U.S. GAAP net income before (i) interest income from cash and leases, (ii) interest (income) expense from debt and tax liabilities, (iii) income tax provision, (iv) depreciation, (v) amortization, (vi) stock-based compensation expense, and (vii) certain other significant infrequent or unusual losses and gains that are not indicative of our core operations such as integration and acquisition expenses and costs as a result of auditor transitions. 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors in comparing our financial performance to other companies and from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and interest income, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on their financing and capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the impact of certain items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. Additionally, we utilize Adjusted EBITDA as a metric in our executive officer and management incentive compensation plans. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, although depreciation expense is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new asset acquisitions. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. Adjusted EBITDA also does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces the cash available to us; or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. The expenses and other items which are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their financial results.

 (c) Costs incurred as a result of former auditor consent procedures. See Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure of the Company's Annual Report . 
 (d) Consists of one-time project expenses incurred in connection with remediation of previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which were remediated during fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. See Item 9A Section e - Remediation of Prior Material Weaknesses of the Company's Annual Report . 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operating activities, debt financings, and equity issuances. The Company's primary sources of capital available are cash and cash equivalents on hand of 33.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and the cash that we expect to be provided by operating activities by the Company. 
 
 The Company also has estimated and recorded for potential sales tax and related interest and penalty liabilities of 9.9 million in the aggregate as of September 30, 2024. The Company continues to evaluate these liabilities and the amount and timing of any such payments. 
 
 The Company believes that its current financial resources will be sufficient to fund its current twelve-month operating budget from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. Our primary focus as part of our core operations to increase cash flow from operating activities is to prioritize collection efforts to reduce outstanding accounts receivable, utilize existing inventory to support equipment sales over the next year, focusing on various operational efficiencies to improve overall profitability of the business and continued to grow our business both domestically and internationally. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 12.0 million which is the result of 20.9 million of cash utilized by working capital accounts, offset by our net income of 3.6 million and non-cash operating charges of 5.3 million. The change in working capital was primarily driven by an increase in cash utilized by accounts payable and accrued expenses of 28.9 million, offset by a 11.0 million decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to cash collections. Increases in cash utilized by accounts payable and accrued expenses and as well as the collection of accounts receivable were the result of the timing of payments made to our customers for transaction processing as September 30, 2024. 
 
 28 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 6.7 million which reflects our net income of 2.0 million and non-cash operating charges of 6.5 million, partially offset by 1.8 million of cash utilized by working capital accounts. The change in working capital accounts was primarily driven by a 7.8 million increase of accounts receivable, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 5.2 million in the period. Increase in cash utilized by accounts receivable was a result of increased sales during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Non-cash operating charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of our intangible assets, and provisions for expected losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We invested 3.8 million in property and equipment as the Company continued to focus on investing in innovative technologies and products, and increasing rental devices enrolled in the Company's Cantaloupe One program. Additionally, the Company invested 9.8 million through its SB Software acquisition. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Increase in cash used was 2.9 million for increased property and equipment balances driven primarily by the Company's continued focus on investing in technologies and products and increasing rental devices enrolled in the Company's Cantaloupe one program. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 0.5 million and 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, both of which are primarily driven by debt repayments on the JPMorgan Credit Facility. 
 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our contractual obligations from those disclosed in the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our outstanding borrowings. Our Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility has a four-year maturity. Interest on the Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility will be based, at the Company s option, on a base rate or SOFR plus an applicable margin tied to the Company s total leverage ratio and having ranges of between 2.50 and 3.00 for base rate loans and between 3.50 and 4.00 for SOFR loans . As of September 30, 2024, we have 37.3 million total outstanding borrowings, an increase of 100 basis points in SOFR Rate would result in a change in interest expen se of 0.4 million p er year. 
 
 We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our cash investments. We invest our excess cash in money market funds that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term. These investments earn a floating rate of interest and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes. Consequently, our exposure to market risks for interest rate changes related to our money market funds is not material. Market risks related to fluctuations of foreign currencies are not material and we have no freestanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 29
