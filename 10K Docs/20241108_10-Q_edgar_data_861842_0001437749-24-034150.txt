The Company recognized a net loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , due to a decrease in fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values compared to a net gain of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Equity securities were million and million as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The following tables set forth the gross unrealized losses and related fair value of the Company s investment portfolio, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual security has been in a continuous unrealized loss position, as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 :

As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had a total of AFS securities in a gross unrealized loss position with no credit impairment, consisting primarily of mortgage-backed securities, and Corporate debt securities, five collateralized mortgage obligations and five U.S. government agency securities. In comparison, as of December 31, 2023 , the Company has a total of AFS securities in a gross unrealized loss position with no credit impairment, consisting primarily of mortgage-backed securities, Corporate debt securities, one U.S. treasury security, collateralized mortgage obligations and eight U.S. government agency securities. 
 
 In March 2023, the Company recorded a million write-off of its holdings of securities AFS from the failed Signature Bank. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company sold that security for million. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The AFS securities that were in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 , were evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis resulted from a credit loss or other factors. For a discussion of the factors and criteria the Company uses in analyzing securities for impairment related to credit losses, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses on Available for Sale Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company s 2023 Form 10 -K. 
 
 The Company concluded the unrealized losses were primarily attributed to yield curve movement, together with widened liquidity spreads and credit spreads. The issuers have not, to the Company s knowledge, established any cause for default on these securities. The Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis of its securities and has no present intent to sell and will not be required to sell securities AFS that have declined below their cost before their anticipated recovery. Accordingly, allowance for credit losses was recorded as of September 30, 2024 , against these securities, and there was provision for credit losses recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 AFS securities having a carrying value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and other borrowings.

The Company has adopted ASU 2022 - 02, "Financial Instruments Troubled Debt Restructurings ("TDR") and Vintage Disclosures" effective January 1, 2023. As part of the adoption, the Company has elected to apply the pending content prospectively and the practical expedient to exclude the accrued interest receivable balance from the disclosed amortized cost basis of loan modifications to debtors experiencing financial difficulty, consistent with our Allowance for Credit Losses ("ACL") approach discussed further below in this footnote. 
 
 Under this guidance on loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, when a loan held for investment is modified and is considered to be a continuation of the original loan, the Company uses the post-modification contractual rate to derive the effective interest rate when using a discounted cash flow method to determine the allowance for credit loss. 
 
 The amendments in this guidance require that an entity evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. 
 
 The Company establishes a specific reserve for individually evaluated loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in the quantitative baseline. These individually evaluated loans are removed from the pooling approach for the quantitative baseline, and include non-accrual loans, loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, and other loans as deemed appropriate by management. The Company applies the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance provided in ASU 2022 - 02 to determine whether a modification made to a borrower result in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. 
 
 If economic conditions or other factors worsen relative to the assumptions the Company utilized, the expected loan losses will increase accordingly in future periods. 
 
 The following table presents the amortized cost of loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty disaggregated by class of financing receivable and type of concession granted and the financial effects of the modifications for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and September 30, 2023 , by loan class and modification type.

The Company considers a loan to be in payment default once it is to days contractually past due under the modified terms. The Company tracks the performance of modified loans. There were loans that received a modification during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , that subsequently defaulted. 
 
 A modified loan may become delinquent and may result in a payment default (generally days past due) subsequent to modification. There were loans that received modifications which subsequently defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The Company closely monitors the performance of modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts.

Under the Company s internal underwriting policy, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification in order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , there were commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and whose loans were modified. 
 
 As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of our loan portfolio, the Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each loan. Loans are risk rated based on analysis of the current state of the borrower s credit quality. The analysis of credit quality includes a review of sources of repayment, the borrower s current financial and liquidity status and other relevant information. The risk rating categories can be generally described by the following grouping for non-homogeneous loans: 
 
 Pass/Watch These loans range from minimal credit risk to higher than average, but still acceptable, credit risk. The loans have sufficient sources of repayment to repay the loans in full, in accordance with all the terms and conditions and remain currently well protected by collateral values. 

Special Mention Borrower is fundamentally sound, and loan is currently protected but adverse trends are apparent that, if not corrected, may affect ability to repay. Primary source of loan repayment remains viable but there is increasing reliance on collateral or guarantor support. 

Substandard These loans are inadequately protected by current sound net worth, paying capacity, or collateral. Well-defined weaknesses exist that could jeopardize repayment of debt. Loss may not be imminent, but if weaknesses are not corrected, there is a good possibility of some loss. 

Doubtful The possibility of loss is extremely high, but due to identifiable and important pending events (which may strengthen the loan), a loss classification is deferred until the situation is better defined. 

Loss These loans are considered uncollectible and of such little value that to continue to carry the loan as an active asset is no longer warranted. 

The following table summarizes the Company s loans held for investment and current year-to-date gross write-offs as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , presented by loan portfolio segments, internal risk ratings and vintage year.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The Company has an allowance framework under ASC Topic 326 for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. The measurement of the allowance for credit losses is based on management s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company s relevant financial assets. The forward-looking concept of current expected credit loss CECL approach requires loss estimates to consider historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts of future events and circumstances. 
 
 The ACL is the combination of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for loan losses is reported as a reduction of the amortized cost basis of loans, while the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is included within "other liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited). The amortized cost basis of loans does not include accrued interest receivable, which is included in "accrued interest receivable" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The "Provision for credit losses" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Unaudited) is a combination of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded loan commitments. 
 
 Under the Company s CECL approach, management estimates the ACL using relevant available information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that vary by loan portfolio. We use economic forecasts from Moody s Analytics in this process. The economic forecast is updated monthly; therefore, the one used for each quarter-end calculation is generally based on a one -month lag based on the timing of when the forecast is released. The Company does not consider a one -month lag to create a material difference but considers any subsequent material changes to our estimated loss forecasts as deemed appropriate. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in gross domestic product (or GDP ), unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors. 
 
 Under the CECL methodology, quantitative and qualitative loss factors are applied to our population of loans on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company evaluates loans for expected credit losses on an individual basis if, based on current information and events, the loan does not share similar credit risk characteristics with other loans. The Company may choose to measure expected credit losses on an individual loan basis by using one of the following methods: 1 the present value of the expected future cash flows of the loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate, or 2 if the loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. For loans that are not collateral-dependent, the Company uses the present value of future cash flows. 
 
 Quantitative Factors 
 
 Under the Company s CECL methodology, nine portfolio segments with similar risk characteristics are evaluated for expected loss. Six portfolios are modeled using econometric models and three smaller portfolios are evaluated using a simplified loss-rate method that calculates lifetime expected credit losses for the respective pools (simplified approach). The six portfolios subject to econometric modeling include residential mortgages; commercial and industrial loans C I construction loans; commercial real estate CRE for multifamily loans; CRE for owner-occupied loans; and other CRE loans. We estimate the probability of default during the reasonable and supportable forecast period using separate econometric regression models developed to correlate macroeconomic variables, (GDP, unemployment, CRE prices and residential mortgage prices) to historical credit performance for each of the six loan portfolios from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2022. Loss given default rates are computed based on the charge-offs recognized divided by the exposure at default of defaulted loans starting with the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2022. The probability of default and the loss given default rates are applied to the expected amount at default at the loan level based on contractual scheduled payments and estimated prepayments. The amounts so calculated comprise the quantitative portion of the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 The Company s CECL methodology utilizes an eight -quarter reasonable and supportable R S forecast period, and a four -quarter reversion period. Management relies on multiple forecasts, blending them into a single loss estimate. Generally speaking, the blended scenario approach would include the Baseline, the Alternative Scenario 1 Upside 10th Percentile and the Alternative Scenario 3 Downside 90th Percentile forecasts. After the R S period, the Company reverts linearly for the four -quarter reversion period to the long-term loss rates for each of the six portfolios of loans. 
 
 The Company s CECL methodology estimates expected credit losses over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. 
 
 The simplified approach portfolios include Small Business Administration SBA loans, Home Equity Lines of Credit HELOCs and cash-secured loans, which are not modelled econometrically due to the low loss history for these three pools of loans. The forecasted loss rate is based on the forecasted GDP and unemployment rates during the first eight quarters of the portfolio s contractual life, reversion loss rates for the next four quarters of the portfolio s contractual life on a linear declining rate, and the long-term loss rate projected over the remainder of the portfolio s contractual life. 
 
 Qualitative Factors 
 
 Under the Company s CECL methodology, the qualitative portion of the reserve on pooled loans represents management s judgment of additional considerations to account for internal and external risk factors that are not adequately measured in the quantitative reserve. The qualitative loss factors consider idiosyncratic risk factors, conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results, or other relevant factors to seek to ensure the allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses. The qualitative reserves include reserves for policy exceptions, experience of management and staff, level of competition in the lending environment, weak risk identification, lack of historical loss experience with residential mortgage loans made to non-U.S. residents, oil gas, the higher risk characteristics of purchased syndicated loans, model uncertainty, and loans with potential risk of loss given the current environment, including CRE and Office loans, but have not degraded to the point of qualifying for a specific reserve. Current and forecasted economic trends and underlying market values for collateral dependent loans also are considered within the econometric models described above. 

The Company s CECL methodology requires a significant amount of management judgment in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses. Several of the steps in the methodology involve judgment and are subjective in nature including, among other things: 
 
 Segmenting the loan portfolio 
 
 Determining the amount of loss history to consider 
 
 Selecting predictive econometric regression models that use appropriate macroeconomic variables 
 
 Determining the methodology to forecast prepayments 
 
 Selecting the most appropriate economic forecast scenario 
 
 Determining the length of the R S forecast and reversion periods 
 
 Estimating expected utilization rates on unfunded loan commitments 
 
 Assessing relevant and appropriate qualitative factors. 

In addition, the CECL methodology is dependent on economic forecasts that are inherently imprecise and will change from period to period. Although the allowance for credit losses is considered by management to be appropriate, there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to absorb future losses. 
 
 Management believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate for the CECL in our loan portfolio and associated unfunded commitments, and the credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are reasonable and appropriate as of the reporting date. The criteria for default may include any one of the following: on nonaccrual status, modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, or payment delinquency of 90 days or more. 
 
 Individually Evaluated Loans 
 
 When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans, such as in the case of certain nonaccrual loans, the Company estimates the allowance for loan losses on an individual loan basis. Generally, the allowance for loan losses for individually evaluated loans is measured as the difference between the recorded value of the loans and the fair value of the collateral. For loans evaluated individually, the Company uses one of two different asset valuation measurement methods: 1 the fair value of collateral less costs to sell; or 2 the present value of expected future cash flows. If an individually evaluated loan is determined to be collateral dependent, the Company applies the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell method. If an individually evaluated loan is determined not to be collateral dependent, the Company uses the present value of future cash flows. 
 
 Unfunded Loan Commitments 
 
 Unfunded loan commitments are generally related to providing credit facilities to clients of the Bank and are not actively traded financial instruments. These unfunded commitments are disclosed as off-balance sheet financial instruments in Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited). 
 
 The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company, using the same loss factors as used for the allowance for loan losses. The reserve for unfunded loan commitments uses a one -year historical usage rate of the unfunded commitments during the contractual life of the commitments. The allowance for unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the allowance for unfunded commitments are included in the provision for credit losses.

Loans Held-for-Sale 
 
 At the time of commitment to originate or purchase a loan, the loan is determined to be held for investment if it is in the Company s intent to hold the loan to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic reviews under the Company s evaluation processes, including asset/liability and credit risk management. When the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, the loans are transferred from held-for-investment to held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value. As of September 30, 2024, there were million of loans held-for-sale, which were all comprised of commercial loans. There were loans held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023.

The trusts exist for the purpose of issuing Capital Securities and investing in Junior Subordinated Notes. Subject to some limitations, payment of distributions out of the monies held by the trusts and payments on liquidation of the trusts, or the redemption of the Capital Securities, are guaranteed by the Company to the extent the trusts have funds on hand at such time. The obligations of the Company under the guarantees and the Junior Subordinated Notes are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the Company and are structurally subordinated to all liabilities and obligations of the Company s subsidiaries. The Company has the right to defer payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes at any time or from time to time for a period of up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods with respect to each deferral period. Under the terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company may not, with certain exceptions, declare or pay any dividends or distributions on its capital stock or purchase or acquire any of its capital stock if it has deferred payment of interest on any Junior Subordinated Notes. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , Junior Subordinated Notes totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of , compared to million with a weighted average rate of at December 31, 2023 . The Junior Subordinated Notes have a stated maturity term of years.

Financial assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a non-recurring basis: 
 
 Certain assets or liabilities are required to be measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to initial recognition. Generally, these adjustments are the result of lower-of-cost-or-fair value or other impairment write-downs of individual assets. In determining the estimated fair values during the period, the Company determined that substantially all the changes in estimated fair value were due to declines in market conditions versus instrument specific credit risk. For the periods ended September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , there were no material adjustments to fair value for the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a restructuring support agreement and received equity securities for equity interest in a private company, a Level 3 measurement. The fair value of the Company s Level 3 equity security was measured using the private company s projected earnings plus cash on hand. The primary inputs and assumptions used in the fair value measurement was derived from the issuer s projected earnings and collateral, which included cash on hand, the financial standing of the issuer, the business and financial plan of the issuer, among other factors. Significant increases or decreases in any of the inputs or assumptions could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value measurement. 
 
 For financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that were still reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023, the following tables set forth the level of valuation assumptions used to determine each adjustment, the carrying value of the related individual assets as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , and the total losses for the periods indicated:

The significant unobservable (Level 3 inputs used in the fair value measurement of collateral for collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans are primarily based on the appraised value of collateral adjusted by estimated sales cost and commissions. The Company generally obtains new appraisal reports every twelve months as appropriate. As the Company s primary objective in the event of default would be to monetize the collateral to settle the outstanding balance of the loan, less marketable collateral would receive a larger discount. In the current year, the Company used borrower specific collateral discounts with various discount levels. 
 
 The fair value of individually evaluated loans is calculated based on the net realizable fair value of the collateral or the observable market price of the most recent sale or quoted price from loans held for sale. The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments to collateral dependent individually evaluated loans are recorded based on the current appraised value of the collateral, a Level 2 measurement, or management s judgment and estimation of value using discounted future cash flows or old appraisals which are then adjusted based on recent market trends, a Level 3 measurement. 
 
 Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value upon transfer. Loans held for sale may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when fair value is less than cost. Fair value is generally determined based on available market data for similar loans and therefore, are classified as Level 2 measurement. 
 
 The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 used in the fair value measurement of other real estate owned OREO are primarily based on the appraised value of OREO adjusted by estimated sales cost and commissions. The Company applies estimated sales cost and commissions ranging from to of the collateral value of individually evaluated loans, quoted price, or loan sale price of loans held for sale, and appraised value of OREO. 

Fair value is estimated in accordance with ASC Topic 825. Fair value estimates are made at specific points in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Bank s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Bank s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

The Company follows ASC Topic 815 that establishes accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives, including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts, and hedging activities. It requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value. The accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge. Fair value is determined using third -party models with observable market data. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction is reflected in earnings. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reflected in current earnings, together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item if there is a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged. If there is not a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged, then only the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its clients. When derivative transactions are executed with its clients, the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with third -party financial institutions including with central counterparties CCP ). Certain derivative contracts entered with CCPs are settled-to-market daily to the extent the CCP s rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. Derivative contracts are intended to allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and long-term fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the Company. These transactions are generally not linked to specific Company assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship and, therefore, are economic hedges. The contracts are marked to market at each reporting period. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third -party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with clients throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component. The Company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the Company and the counterparties, considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements. As of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , the Company had outstanding interest rate derivative contracts with certain clients and third -party financial institutions with a notional amount of million and million, respectively, with a fair value of million and million, respectively, for both clients and third -party financial institutions. As of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , for borrower swap transactions, there were notional amount of interest rate swaps cleared through the CCP. 
 
 In May 2014, Bancorp entered into interest rate swap contracts in the notional amount of million for a period of ten years. The objective of these interest rate swap contracts, which were designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, was to hedge the quarterly interest payments on Bancorp s million of Junior Subordinated Debentures that had been issued to five trusts, throughout the ten -year period beginning in June 2014 and ending in June 2024, from the risk of variability of these payments resulting from changes in the three -month LIBOR interest rate. The Company early terminated these cash flow derivative swaps in 2022 and realized a gain of million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and is recognizing the amount as a reduction of long-term debt interest expense over the remaining life of the swaps on a straight-line basis ending in June 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Bank s outstanding fair value interest rate swap contracts matched to individual fixed-rate commercial real estate loans had a notional amount of million with a fair value of million and various terms from three to ten years. These contracts have been designated as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the underlying commercial real estate loans due to changes in interest rates. The swap contracts are structured so that the notional amounts reduce over time to match the contractual amortization of the underlying loan and allow prepayments with the same pre-payment penalty amounts as the related loan. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the ineffective portion of these interest rate swaps was not significant. 
 
 The Company has designated as a partial-term hedging election of million notional with a net fair value loss of million as last-of-layer hedge on pools of loans with a notational value of billion as of September 30, 2024 . The loans are not expected to be affected by prepayment, defaults, or other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows under the last-of-layer method. The Company has entered into these pay-fixed and receive 1 -Month Term SOFR interest rate swaps to convert the last-of-layer million portion of billion fixed rate loan pools in order to reduce the Company s exposure to higher interest rates for the last-of-layer tranches. As of September 30, 2024 , the last-of-layer loan tranche had a net fair value gain basis adjustment of million. The interest rate swap converts this last-of-layer tranche into a floating rate instrument. The Company s risk management objective with respect to this last-of-layer interest rate swap is to reduce interest rate exposure as to the last-of-layer tranche. 
 
 Interest rate swap contracts involve the risk of dealing with institutional derivative counterparties and their ability to meet contractual terms. Institutional counterparties must have a strong credit profile and be approved by the Company s Board of Directors. The Company s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net favorable value and interest payments of all swaps by each counterparty. Credit exposure may be reduced by the amount of collateral pledged by the counterparty. Bancorp s interest rate swaps have been assigned by the counterparties to a derivative clearing organization and daily margin is indirectly maintained with the derivative clearing organization. 
 
 The notional amount and net unrealized loss of the Company s fair value derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , were as follows: 

Weighted average fixed rate-pay 
 Weighted average variable rate spread 
 Weighted average variable rate-receive 
 
 Net (loss)/gain (1) 

(1) the amount is included in other non-interest income. 
 (2) the amount of periodic net settlement of interest rate swaps was included in interest income. 

Included in the total notional amount of million of the fair value interest rate contracts entered into with financial counterparties as of September 30, 2024 , was a notional amount of million of interest rate swaps that cleared through the CCP. Applying variation margin payments as settlement to CCP cleared derivative transactions resulted in a reduction in derivative asset fair values of million as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts with various counterparties to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign exchange certificates of deposit or foreign exchange contracts entered into with our clients. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of these contracts as well as the related foreign exchange certificates of deposit and foreign exchange contracts are recognized immediately in net income as a component of non-interest income. Period end gross positive fair values are recorded in other assets and gross negative fair values are recorded in other liabilities. 
 
 The notional amount and fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , not including interest rate swaps cleared through the CCP, were as follows:

Net Interest Income Before Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 Net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased 16.4 million, or 8.8 , to 169.2 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 185.6 million during the same quarter a year ago. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in interest expense from deposits, offset by an increase in interest income from loans and securities. 
 
 The net interest margin was 3.04 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.38 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 6.10 , the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities was 3.99 , and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.95 . In comparison, for the third quarter of 2023, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.89 , the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities was 3.33 , and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.23 . The increase in the yield on average interest-bearing liabilities and on average interest-earning assets resulted mainly from higher interest rates. The net interest spread, defined as the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.11 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.56 for the same quarter a year ago.

Balance Sheet Review 
 
 Assets 
 
 Total assets were 23.27 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 192.9 million, or 0.8 , from 23.08 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Securities Available-for-Sale 
 
 Debt securities available-for-sale are measured at fair value and subject to impairment testing. When an available-for-sale debt security is considered impaired, the Company must determine if the decline in fair value has resulted from a credit-related loss or other factors and then, (1) recognize an allowance for credit losses by a charge to earnings for the credit-related component (if any) of the decline in fair value, and (2) recognize in other comprehensive income (loss) any non-credit related components of the fair value change. If the amount of the amortized cost basis expected to be recovered increases in a future period, the valuation reserve would be reduced, but not more than the amount of the current existing reserve for that security. 
 
 For available-for-sale AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value. For AFS debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. 
 
 In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the payment structure of the security, failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. Any fair value changes that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. 
 
 Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of an AFS debt security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for credit loss expense. 

34

Table of Contents 

The amortized cost of the Company s AFS debt securities exclude accrued interest, which is included in accrued interest income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables on AFS debt securities since the Company timely reverses any previously accrued interest when the debt security remains in default for an extended period. As each AFS debt security has a unique security structure, where the accrual status is clearly determined when certain criteria listed in the terms are met, the Company assesses the default status of each security as defined by the debt security s specific security structure. At September 30, 2024, no AFS debt securities were in default. 
 
 In the current period, management evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position and determined that their unrealized losses were a result of the level of market interest rates relative to the types of securities and pricing changes caused by shifting supply and demand dynamics and not a result of downgraded credit ratings or other indicators of deterioration of the underlying issuers' ability to repay. Accordingly, we determined the unrealized losses were not credit-related and recognized the unrealized losses in "other comprehensive income/(loss)" in stockholders' equity. Although we periodically sell securities for portfolio management purposes, we do not foresee having to sell any impaired securities strictly for liquidity needs and believe that it is more likely than not we would not be required to sell any impaired securities before recovery of their amortized cost. 
 
 Securities available-for-sale represented 6.5 of total assets as of September 30, 2024, compared to 7.0 of total assets as of December 31, 2023. Securities available-for-sale were 1.51 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1.60 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Securities available-for-sale having a carrying value of 18.4 million as of September 30, 2024, and 134.2 million as of December 31, 2023, were pledged to secure public deposits and other borrowings. 
 
 Loans 
 
 Gross loans held for investment were 19.37 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 174.5 million, or 0.9 , from 19.55 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 198.1 million, or 6.0 , in commercial loans, a decrease of 115.6 million, or 27.3 in real estate construction loans, and a decrease of 88.2 million, or 1.5 in residential mortgage loans, offset, in part, by an increase of 245.7 million, or 2.5 in commercial real estate loans.

Non-performing Assets 
 
 Non-performing assets include loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, non-accrual loans, and OREO. Our policy is to place loans on non-accrual status if interest and/or principal is past due 90 days or more, or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely. After a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against current income and subsequent payments received are generally first applied towards the outstanding principal balance of the loan. Depending on the circumstances, management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received and/or the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. The loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and, in the opinion of management, the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled. 
 
 Management reviews the loan portfolio regularly to seek to identify problem loans. During the ordinary course of business, management may become aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of their loan agreements. Such loans generally are placed under closer supervision with consideration given to placing the loans on non-accrual status, the need for an additional allowance for loan losses, and (if appropriate) partial or full charge-off. 
 
 The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets was 0.81 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 0.40 as of December 31, 2023. Total non-performing assets increased 94.7 million, or 101.5 to 188.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 93.3 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 96.1 million, or 144.1 , in non-accrual loans offset, in part, by a decrease of 1.2 million, or 6.0 in other real estate owned, and a decrease of 0.2 million, or 3.2 in accruing loans past due 90 days or more. 
 
 As a percentage of gross loans, excluding loans held for sale, plus OREO, our non-performing assets were 0.97 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 0.48 as of December 31, 2023. The non-performing loan portfolio coverage ratio, defined as the allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans, decreased to 102.07 as of September 30, 2024, from 221.58 as of December 31, 2023.

At September 30, 2024, commercial non-accrual loans included 19.5 million of loans that are current. 

Non-accrual Loans 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, total non-accrual loans were 162.8 million, an increase of 96.1 million, or 144.1 , from 66.7 million at December 31, 2023, and an increase of 85.5 million, or 110.5 , from 77.3 million at September 30, 2023. The allowance for the collateral-dependent loans is calculated based on the difference between the outstanding loan balance and the value of the collateral as determined by recent appraisals, sales contracts, or other available market price information, less cost to sell. The allowance for collateral-dependent loans varies from loan to loan based on the collateral coverage of the loan at the time of designation as non-performing. We continue to monitor the collateral coverage of these loans, based on recent appraisals, on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance accordingly.

For non-accrual loans, the amounts previously charged-off represent 10.0 of the contractual balances for non-accrual loans as of September 30, 2024, and 15.8 as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 110.8 million, or 68.0 , of the 162.8 million of non-accrual loans were secured by real estate compared to 52.3 million, or 78.4 , of the 66.7 million of non-accrual loans that were secured by real estate as of December 31, 2023. The Bank generally seeks to obtain current appraisals, sales contracts, or other available market price information intended to provide updated factors in evaluating potential loss. 
 
 The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 96.4 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 209.3 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in non-accrual loans. Non-accrual loans also include those modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that do not qualify for accrual status. 
 
 Loan Interest Reserves 
 
 In accordance with customary banking practice, construction loans and land development loans generally are originated where interest on the loan is disbursed from pre-established interest reserves included in the total original loan commitment. Our construction loans and land development loans generally include optional renewal terms after the maturity of the initial loan term. New appraisals are obtained prior to extension or renewal of these loans in part to determine the appropriate interest reserve to be established for the new loan term. Loans with interest reserves are generally underwritten to the same criteria, including loan to value and, if applicable, pro forma debt service coverage ratios, as loans without interest reserves. Construction loans with interest reserves are monitored on a periodic basis to gauge progress towards completion. Interest reserves are frozen if it is determined that additional draws would result in a loan to value ratio that exceeds policy maximums based on collateral property type. Our policy limits in this regard are consistent with supervisory limits and range from 50 in the case of land to 85 in the case of one to four family residential construction projects. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, construction loans of 248.2 million were disbursed with pre-established interest reserves of 32.8 million, compared to 220.6 million with pre-established interest reserves of 41.3 million at December 31, 2023. The balance for construction loans with interest reserves that have been extended was 5.5 million with pre-established interest reserves of 0.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 6.4 million with pre-established interest reserves of 0.5 million at December 31, 2023. Land loans of 8.8 million were disbursed with pre-established interest reserves of 59 thousand at September 30, 2024, compared to 12.9 million of land loans disbursed with pre-established interest reserves of 0.4 million at December 31, 2023. There were no land loans with interest reserves which have been extended as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Bank had no loans on non-accrual status with available interest reserves. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were zero non-accrual non-residential construction loans, residential construction loans, or land loans that were originated with pre-established interest reserves. While we typically expect loans with interest reserves to be repaid in full according to the original contractual terms, some loans may require one or more extensions beyond the original maturity before full repayment. Typically, these extensions are required due to construction delays, delays in the sale or lease of the property, or some combination of these two factors. 
 
 Loan Concentration 
 
 Most of the Company s business activities are with clients located in the high-density Asian-populated areas of Southern and Northern California; New York City, New York; Dallas and Houston, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Edison, New Jersey; Rockville, Maryland; and Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company also has loan clients in Hong Kong. The Company has no specific industry concentration, and generally our loans are collateralized with real property or other pledged collateral of the borrowers. The Company generally expects loans to be paid off from the operating profits of the borrowers, refinancing by another lender, or through sale by the borrowers of the collateral. 
 
 The federal banking regulatory agencies issued final guidance on December 6, 2006, regarding risk management practices for financial institutions with high or increasing concentrations of commercial real estate CRE loans on their balance sheets. The regulatory guidance reiterates the need for sound internal risk management practices for those institutions that have experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, have notable exposure to specific types of CRE, or are approaching or exceeding the supervisory criteria used to evaluate the CRE concentration risk, but the guidance is not to be construed as a limit for CRE exposure. The supervisory criteria are: (1) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 of the institution s total risk-based capital, and (2) both total CRE loans represent 300 or more of the institution s total risk-based capital and the institution s CRE loan portfolio has increased 50 or more within the last thirty-six months. The Bank s loans for construction, land development, and other land represented 14 and 19 of the Bank s total risk-based capital as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total CRE loans represented 289 of total risk-based capital as of September 30, 2024, and 292 as of December 31, 2023, which were within the Bank s internal limit of 400 , of total capital.

Commercial Real Estate Loans 
 
 The Company focuses on providing financing to experienced real estate investors and developers who have moderate levels of leverage, many of whom are long-time customers of the Bank. CRE loans totaled 7.16 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared with 7.06 billion as of December 31, 2023, and accounted for 37 and 36 of total loans held-for-investment, not including loans held for sale, as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest rates on CRE loans may be fixed or variable. As of September 30, 2024, 25 and 37 of our CRE portfolio were variable rate and hybrid loans in their fixed period, respectively. In comparison, as of December 31, 2023, 25 and 40 of our CRE portfolio were variable rate and hybrid loans in their fixed period, respectively. Loans are underwritten with conservative standards for cash flows, debt service coverage and LTV. 
 
 Owner-occupied properties comprised 23 of the CRE loans as of both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The remainder were non-owner-occupied properties, where 50 or more of the debt service for the loan is typically provided by rental income from an unaffiliated third party. 
 
 Commercial-Multifamily Residential Loans 
 
 The multifamily residential loan portfolio is largely comprised of loans secured by residential properties with five or more units. Multifamily residential loans totaled 2.73 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared with 2.60 billion as of December 31, 2023, and accounted for 14 and 13 of total loans held-for investment, not including loans held for sale, as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company offers a variety of first lien mortgages, including fixed- and variable-rate loans. As of September 30, 2024, 21 and 39 of our multifamily residential loan portfolio were variable rate and hybrid loans in their fixed period, respectively. In comparison, as of December 31, 2023, 20 and 40 of our multifamily residential loan portfolio were variable rate and hybrid loans in their fixed period, respectively. 
 
 Commercial-Construction and Land Loans 
 
 Construction and land loans provide financing for diversified projects by real estate property type. Construction and land loans totaled 384.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with 494.5 million as of December 31, 2023, and accounted for 2 and 3 of total loans held-for-investment, not including loans held for sale, as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Construction loan exposure was made up of 307.1 million in loans outstanding, plus 180.9 million in unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024, compared with 422.6 million in loans outstanding, plus 280.5 million in unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2023. Land loans totaled 77.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with 71.8 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The Bank maintains the allowance for credit losses at a level that the Bank s management considers appropriate to cover the estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio and off-balance sheet unfunded credit commitments. Allowance for credit losses is comprised of the allowance for loan losses and for off-balance sheet unfunded credit commitments. With this risk management objective, the Bank s management has an established monitoring system that is designed to identify individually evaluated and potential problem loans, and to permit periodic evaluation of impairment and the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses in a timely manner. 
 
 In addition, the Company s Board of Directors has established a written credit policy that includes a credit review and control system that it believes should be effective in ensuring that the Bank maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The Board of Directors provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process, including quarterly evaluations, and determines whether the allowance is appropriate to absorb losses in the credit portfolio. The determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses are based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and take into consideration known relevant internal and external factors that affect collectability when determining the appropriate level for the allowance for credit losses. The nature of the process by which the Bank determines the appropriate allowance for credit losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment. Additions or reductions to the allowance for credit losses are made by charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. While management utilizes its business judgment based on the information available, the ultimate appropriateness of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the Bank s control, including but not limited to the performance of the Bank s loan portfolio, the economy and market conditions, changes in interest rates, and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications. Identified credit exposures that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses. A weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults, and a higher level of non-performing assets, net charge-offs, and provision for credit losses. 
 
 The allowance for loan losses was 163.7 million and the allowance for off-balance sheet unfunded credit commitments was 9.5 million at September 30, 2024, which represented the amount estimated by management to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance for credit losses, which is the sum of the allowances for loan losses and for off-balance sheet unfunded credit commitments, was 173.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 163.6 million at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses represented 0.89 of period-end gross loans and 102.07 of non-performing loans at September 30, 2024. The comparable ratios were 0.84 of period-end gross loans and 221.58 of non-performing loans at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. We identify critical policies and estimates as those that require management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We have identified the policy and estimates related to the allowance for credit losses on loans as a critical accounting policy. 
 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Form 10-K. For more information, please also see Note 2 to the Company s unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Expected Credit Losses Estimate for Loans 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is the combination of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The allowance for loan losses is reported as a reduction of the amortized cost basis of loans, while the reserve for unfunded loan commitments is included within "Other liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortized cost basis of loans does not include interest receivable, which is included in "Other assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The "Provision for credit losses" on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income is a combination of the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded loan commitments. 
 
 Under the CECL methodology, expected credit losses reflect losses over the remaining contractual life of an asset, considering the effect of prepayments and available information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about relevant historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and circumstances. Thus, the CECL methodology incorporates a broad range of information in developing credit loss estimates. For further information regarding the calculation of the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment using the CECL methodology, see Note 8 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements." 
 
 In calculating our allowance for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024, the change in Moody s forecast of future GDP, unemployment rates, CRE and home price indexes did not result in a significant impact to the allowance for credit losses. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due to a provision for the delay in getting current appraisals for the new non-accrual loans added during the third quarter. Our methodology and framework along with the 8-quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period and the 4-quarter reversion period have remained consistent since the implementation of CECL. Certain management assumptions are reassessed every quarter based on current expectations for credit losses, while other assumptions are assessed and updated on at least an annual basis. 
 
 The use of different economic forecasts, whether based on different scenarios, the use of multiple or single scenarios, or updated economic forecasts and scenarios, can change the outcome of the calculations. In addition to the economic forecasts, there are numerous components and assumptions that are integral to the overall estimation of allowance for credit losses. 
 
 The determination of the allowance for credit losses is complex and dependent on numerous models, assumptions, and judgments made by management. Management's current expectation for credit losses as quantified in the allowance for credit losses, considers the impact of assumptions and is reflective of historical credit experience, economic forecasts viewed to be reasonable and supportable, current loan composition, and relative credit risks known as of the balance sheet date. 
 
 Under the Company s CECL methodology, nine portfolio segments with similar risk characteristics are evaluated for expected loss. Six portfolios are modeled using econometric models and three smaller portfolios are evaluated using a simplified loss-rate method that calculates lifetime expected credit losses for the respective pools (simplified approach). The six portfolios subject to econometric modeling include residential mortgages; commercial and industrial loans C I construction loans; commercial real estate CRE for multifamily loans; CRE for owner-occupied loans; and other CRE loans. We estimate the probability of default during the reasonable and supportable forecast period using separate econometric regression models developed to correlate macroeconomic variables, (GDP, unemployment, CRE prices and residential mortgage prices) to historical credit performance for each of the six loan portfolios from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2022. Loss given default rates are computed based on the net charge-offs recognized and then applied to the expected exposure at default of defaulted loans starting with the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2022. The probability of default and the loss given default rates are applied to the expected amount at default at the loan level based on contractual scheduled payments and estimated prepayments. The amounts so calculated comprise the quantitative portion of the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 The Company s CECL methodology utilizes an eight-quarter reasonable and supportable R S forecast period, and a four-quarter reversion period. Management relies on multiple forecasts, blending them into a single loss estimate. Generally speaking, the blended scenario approach would include the Baseline, the Alternative Scenario 1 Upside 10th Percentile and the Alternative Scenario 3 Downside 90th Percentile forecasts. After the R S period, the Company will revert straight-line for the four-quarter reversion period to the long-term loss rates for each of the six portfolios of loans. The contractual term excludes renewals and modifications but includes pre-approved extensions and prepayment assumptions where applicable. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs, including macroeconomic forecast assumptions and credit rating migrations during the period. Our macroeconomic forecasts used in determining the September 30, 2024, allowance for credit losses consisted of three scenarios as provided by an outside forecaster. Because the December 2022 baseline scenario did not forecast a recession in the forecast period, we increased the weighting of the downside scenario to reflect our expectations that a recession in the forecast period was more likely than not. During the third quarter of 2023, in light of the continued strength of the economy, we reduced the weighting of the most severe scenario slightly. The baseline scenario reflects modest ongoing GDP growth and a steady decline in the unemployment rate starting from 4.20 in the fourth quarter of 2024 to 4.03 by the end of the R S period. The upside scenario reflects higher GDP growth and lower unemployment rates with the stronger economy resulting in inflation and interest rates a bit higher than in the baseline scenario, though the Federal Reserve is projected to continue to cut the Fed funds rate in the fourth quarter of 2024. The downside scenario contemplates a recession and the weakening economy prompts the Fed to lower the fed funds rate below the baseline in the fourth quarter of 2024, resulting in negative GDP growth for three quarters peaking at 3.5 in the first quarter of 2025, rising unemployment that peaks at 8.3 in the fourth quarter of 2025, a decline in CRE prices of 12.4 and a decline in residential home prices of 12.7 during the forecast period. As of September 30, 2024, we placed the same weight on our downside and base scenario, with a small weighting on the upside scenario.

Table of Contents 

Keeping all other factors constant, we estimate that if we had applied 100 weighting to the downside scenario, the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024, would have been approximately 58.8 million higher. This estimate is intended to reflect the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in our scenario weights and is not intended to be indicative of future changes in the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Management believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate for the current expected credit losses in our loan portfolio and associated unfunded commitments, and the credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are reasonable and appropriate as of the reporting date. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different conclusions that could result in a significant impact to the Company's financial statements.

FDIC Special Assessment and Uninsured Deposits 
 
 In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule that would impose a special deposit insurance assessment on banks in order to recover losses that the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") has incurred in the receiverships of failed institutions. Under the final rule, the FDIC would impose the special assessment for eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of 2024 assessment period, subject to adjustment if the total amount collected is insufficient to cover the DIF's cost. Each quarterly special assessment would be equal to 3.36 basis points (0.0336 of a bank's estimated uninsured deposits that exceeded 5 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Company recognized 11.3 million related to the special assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023. Based on updated information received from the FDIC about the estimated losses for the failed institutions, the Company recognized an additional 2.9 million of the special assessment in the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. Depending on future adjustments to the DIF's estimated loss, the FDIC has retained the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period, or impose a one-time final shortfall assessment.

In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our clients. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Loan Commitments - We enter into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon clients maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. We minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Standby Letters of Credit - Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to secure the obligations of a client to a third party. In the event the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of an agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek reimbursement from the client. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. 
 
 Capital Resources

 Dividend Policy 
 
 Holders of common stock are entitled to dividends as and when declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. Although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so. We increased the common stock dividend from 0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, to 0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018, to 0.34 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. The amount of future dividends, if any, will depend on our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by our Board of Directors. The terms of our Junior Subordinated Notes also limit our ability to pay dividends. If we are not current in our payment of dividends on our Junior Subordinated Notes, we may not pay dividends on our common stock. 

44

Table of Contents 

The Company declared a cash dividend of 0.34 per share on 71,559,973 shares outstanding on August 15, 2024, for distribution to holders of our common stock on August 29, 2024. The Company paid total cash dividends of 24.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 73.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity is our ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to meet maturing financial obligations and client credit needs, and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented in the marketplace. Our principal sources of liquidity are growth in deposits, proceeds from the maturity or sale of securities and other financial instruments, repayments from securities and loans, Federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and advances from the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024, our average monthly liquidity ratio (defined as net cash plus short-term and marketable securities to net deposits and short-term liabilities) was 14.6 compared to 13.7 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank is a shareholder of the FHLB, which enables the Bank to have access to lower-cost FHLB financing when necessary. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had an approved credit line with the FHLB of San Francisco totaling 8.13 billion. Total advances from the FHLB of San Francisco were 60.0 million and standby letters of credit issued by the FHLB on the Company s behalf were 965.0 million as of September 30, 2024. These borrowings bear fixed rates and are secured by the Bank s loans. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At September 30, 2024, the Bank pledged 500.0 million of its commercial loans and 1.1 million of securities to the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window under the Borrower-in-Custody program. The Bank had borrowing capacity of 438.2 million from the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity can also be provided through the sale of liquid assets, which may consist of federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and securities available-for-sale. At September 30, 2024, investment securities totaled 1.51 billion, with 18.4 million pledged as collateral for borrowings and other commitments. The remaining balance was available as additional liquidity or to be pledged as collateral for additional borrowings. 
 
 Approximately 99.8 of our time deposits mature within one year or less as of September 30, 2024. Management anticipates that these deposits will reprice lower as a result of the expected decreases in the target Fed funds rate expected in 2024. Management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the keen competition in the Bank s marketplace. However, based on our historical runoff experience, we expect the outflow will not be significant and can be replenished through our normal growth in deposits. As of September 30, 2024, management believes all the above-mentioned sources will provide adequate liquidity during the next twelve months for the Bank to meet its operating needs. 
 
 The business activities of Bancorp consist primarily of the operation of the Bank and limited activities in other investments. The Bank paid dividends to Bancorp totaling 156.0 million and 107.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We use a net interest income simulation model to measure the extent of the differences in the behavior of the lending and funding rates to changing interest rates, to project future earnings or market values under alternative interest rate scenarios. Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Company s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Many factors, including but not limited to economic, market and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. The net interest income simulation model is designed to measure the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value, defined as net present value of assets and liabilities, under immediate rising or falling interest rate scenarios in 100 basis point increments. 
 
 Although the modeling can be helpful in managing interest rate risk, it does require significant assumptions for the projection of loan prepayment rates on mortgage related assets, loan volumes and pricing, and deposit and borrowing volume and pricing, that might prove inaccurate. Because these assumptions are inherently uncertain, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income, or precisely predict the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, the differences between actual experience and the assumed volume, changes in market conditions, and management strategies, among other factors. The Company monitors its interest rate sensitivity and seeks to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by a change in interest rates. 
 
 We have established a tolerance level in our policy to define and limit net interest income volatility to a change of plus or minus 5 when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus 200 basis points. When the net interest rate simulation projects that our tolerance level will be met, or exceeded, we seek corrective action after considering, among other things, market conditions, client reaction, and the estimated impact on profitability. The Company s simulation model also projects the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities. We have established a tolerance level in our policy to limit the loss in the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities to zero when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus 200 basis points. 
 
 The table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of equity as of September 30, 2024:

(1) The percentage change in this column represents net interest income of the Company for 12 months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios. Much of the increase in net interest income is due to the lag in the repricing of certificates of deposits which mature throughout the twelve month period.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 
 From time to time, Bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business or otherwise is incidental to various aspects of its operations. Based upon information available to the Company and its review of any such litigation with counsel, management presently believes that the liability relating to such litigation, if any, would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity taken as a whole. The outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, however, and it is possible that one or more of the legal matters currently pending or threatened against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity taken as a whole. 
 
 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 
 The Company is not aware of any material change to the risk factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. The risk factors disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those not presently known to the Company or that the Company presently believes not to be material, could also materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations and stock price.
