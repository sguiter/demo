On September 20, 2024 (the Closing Date ), the Company and its subsidiaries, Dory Acquisition Sub, Inc. Dory Acquisition and OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) Limited OneSpaWorld Bahamas and together with Dory Acquisition, the Borrowers ), entered into a credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders party thereto, providing for senior secured credit facilities consisting of (x) a term loan facility of million (of which million was borrowed by Dory Acquisition and million was borrowed by OneSpaWorld Bahamas) (the Term Loan Facility ), which was fully drawn on the Closing Date, and (y) a revolving loan facility of up to million (the Revolving Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Facilities ), which Revolving Facility remained undrawn upon the closing of the Credit Facilities and as of September 30, 2024. The Revolving Facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit up to million. Any issuance of letters of credit reduces the amount available under the Revolving Facility. The Credit Facilities mature on . Loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to Term , with three step ups to a maximum margin of depending on the most recent consolidated leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, and undrawn amounts under the Revolving Facility will accrue a commitment fee at a rate per annum of on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments thereunder, with three step ups to a maximum commitment fee of depending on the most recent consolidated leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries. The obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the Company and each of its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries other than certain excluded subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors ). The obligations of the Company, the Borrowers and the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all of their assets. The Term Loan Facility requires the Borrowers to make certain mandatory prepayments, with (i) of net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property, subject to the ability to reinvest such proceeds and certain other exceptions, and (ii) of the net cash proceeds of any debt incurrence, other than debt permitted under the definitive agreements (but excluding debt incurred to refinance the Credit Facilities). The Borrowers also are required to make quarterly amortization payments equal to of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility commencing on March 31, 2025 (subject to reductions by optional and mandatory prepayments of the loans). The Borrowers may prepay the Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, subject to payment of customary breakage costs. to , subject to certain exceptions, and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to . Additionally, the New Credit Agreement contains a number of customary negative covenants that restrict, among other things and in each case subject to specified exceptions, the Company's and its restricted subsidiaries' ability to: consummate consolidations, mergers and sales of assets; grant certain liens; incur additional debt; pay certain dividends; and engage in transactions with affiliates. The New Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Facilities are entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Credit Facilities and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. The proceeds from the Credit Facilities were used, together with cash on hand, to repay in full the remaining principal balance of the First Lien Term Loan Facility and to pay related financing costs of the Credit Facilities. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, our First Lien Term Loan Facility has been fully paid and terminated. The Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million. This amount is reflected as part of the interest expense, net on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Borrowing Capacity: million. Utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows (in thousands):

and , respectively, Sponsor and Public Warrants were issued and outstanding. During the first quarter of 2024, certain holders of the Sponsor and Public Warrants elected to exercise warrants for which the Company issued common shares. Net cash proceeds from the exercise of the warrants amounted to million. Immediately prior to the exercises, the Sponsor and Public Warrants exercised were remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of million in "Change in fair value of warrant liabilities" on the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and Warrant liabilities of million, which was then reclassified to Additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Sponsor and Public Warrants expired on and there were amounts outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 2020 PIPE Warrants As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, 2020 PIPE Warrants were issued and outstanding. During the first quarter of 2024, certain holders of the 2020 PIPE Warrants elected to exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the agreements governing the warrants, in exchange for which the Company issued common shares. During the second quarter of 2024, one holder of the 2020 PIPE Warrants elected to exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the agreement governing the warrants, in exchange for which the Company issued common shares on July 1, 2024. Immediately prior to the exchanges, the 2020 PIPE Warrants exercised were remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of million in "Change in fair value of warrant liabilities" on the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and Warrant liabilities of million, which was then reclassified to Additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Repurchase Agreement On March 13, 2024, the Company entered into a Shares Repurchase Agreement between the Company and Steiner Leisure Limited (the Seller ), pursuant to which the Company purchased common shares, par value per share, from the Seller at a purchase price of per Common Share (the Repurchase ). The Repurchase resulted in the sale of all remaining common shares of the Company held by the Seller, which ceased to be a shareholder of the Company after the closing of the Repurchase. The Repurchase closed on March 20, 2024. Upon the consummation of the Repurchase, such shares reverted to authorized but unissued shares of the Company. We allocated the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of the shares acquired between Additional paid-in capital and Accumulate d deficit. Dividends Cancelled In November 2019, the Company adopted a cash dividend program and declared an initial quarterly payment of per common share. On March 24, 2020, the Company announced that it was deferring payment of its dividend declared on (the "2020 Dividend"), for payment on , to shareholders of record on , until the Board reapproves its payment. The Company also announced it was withdrawing its dividend program until further notice. As of December 31, 2023, dividends payable amounted to approximately million which was presented as other-long term liabilities and other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the first quarter of 2024, the Board determined that although the Company now has the liquidity to enable it to pay the 2020 Dividend, such payment can no longer be made to the shareholders of record as of the original record date for the 2020 Dividend and it is therefore in the Company s best interest to cancel the 2020 Dividend. As a result, we reversed the dividend payable of million against additional paid-in capital during the first quarter of 2024. Dividends Declared Per Common Share On July 23, 2024, the Company s board of directors adopted an annual cash dividend program with the initial quarterly dividend payment of per common share. The first quarterly dividend was paid on to shareholders of record as of the close of business on . Share Repurchase Program On April 24, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to million of its common shares. The share repurchases will be funded through the Company s available cash.

Amortization of the deferred contract costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively.

Both the fixed and floating payment streams are based on a notional amount of million at the inception of the contract. In June 2023, the interest rate swap agreement was amended to replace the reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR, to be consistent with the amended First Lien Credit Facilities. The interest rate swap agreement matured on . As of December 31, 2023, the notional amount was million. In September 2024, the Borrowers entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million and million, respectively, with Bank of America, N.A. to make a series of payments based on a fixed interest rate of and , respectively, and receive a series of payments based on the 1 Month USD-SOFR CME term which is used to hedge the Company s exposure to changes in cash flows associated with its variable rate Term Loan Facility and has designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge.

There was no ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swaps. The gain or loss on the derivatives is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company expects to reclassify million of income from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into interest expense within the next twelve months. The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts is measured on a recurring basis by netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on the expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The interest rate swap contracts were categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company is not required to post cash collateral related to these derivative instruments.)

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of million and an income tax benefit of million, respectively. The difference between the expected provision for income taxes using the U.S. federal income tax rate and the Company s actual provision for income taxes is primarily attributable to the foreign rate differential, including income earned in jurisdictions not subject to income taxes, permanent differences, withholding taxes due in various jurisdictions and the change in valuation allowance.

 Overview 
 In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our expectation for future performance, liquidity and capital resources that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described in the sections entitled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors and in Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements. 
 
 OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited OneSpaWorld, the Company, we, our, us and other similar terms refer to OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries) is the pre-eminent global operator of health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and a leading operator of health and wellness centers at destination resorts worldwide. Our highly trained and experienced staff offer guests a comprehensive suite of premium health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products onboard cruise ships and at destination resorts globally. We are the market leader at more than 20x the size of our closest maritime competitor. Over the last 50 years, we have built our leading market position on our depth of staff expertise, broad and innovative service and product offerings, expansive global recruitment, training and logistics platform, as well as decades-long relationships with cruise line and destination resort partners. Throughout our history, our mission has been simple: helping guests look and feel their best during and after their stay. 
 
 At our core, we are a global services company. We serve a critical role for our cruise line and destination resort partners, operating a complex and increasingly important aspect of our cruise line and destination resort partners overall guest experience. Decades of investment and know-how have allowed us to construct an unmatched global infrastructure to manage the complexity of our operations. We have consistently expanded our onboard offerings with innovative and leading-edge service and product introductions, and developed the powerful back-end recruiting, training and logistics platforms to manage our operational complexity, maintain our industry-leading quality standards, and maximize revenue and profitability per center. The combination of our renowned recruiting and training platform, deep proprietary labor pool, global logistics and supply chain infrastructure, and proven health and wellness center and revenue management capabilities represents a significant competitive advantage that we believe is not economically feasible to replicate. 
 
 A significant portion of our revenues are generated from our cruise ship operations. Historically, we have been able to renew almost all of our cruise line agreements that expired or were scheduled to expire. 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider key performance indicators used by management, including, among others: 
 Average Ship Count . The number of ships, on average during the period, on which we operate health and wellness centers. This is a key metric that impacts revenue and profitability and reflects the fact that during the period ships were in and out of service, and is calculated by adding the total number of days that each of the ships generated revenue during the period, divided by the number of calendar days during the period. 

Period End Ship Count : The number of ships at period end on which we operate health and wellness centers. This is a key metric that impacts revenue and profitability. 

Average Weekly Revenue Per Ship . A key indicator of productivity per ship. Revenue per ship can be affected by the various sizes of health and wellness centers and categories of ships on which we serve. 

Average Revenue Per Shipboard Staff Per Day . We utilize this performance metric to assist in determining the productivity of our onboard staff, which we believe is a critical element of our operations. 

Average Resort Count . The number of destination resorts on average during the period in which we operate the health and wellness centers. This is a key metric that impacts revenue and profitability and reflects the fact that during the period destination resort health and wellness centers were in and out of service, and is calculated by adding the total number of days that each destination resort health and wellness center generated revenue during the period, divided by the number of calendar days during the period. 

Period End Resort Count . The number of destination resorts at period end on which we operate the health and wellness centers. This is a key metric that impacts revenue and profitability. 

Average Weekly Revenue Per Destination Resort . A key indicator of productivity per destination resort health and wellness center. Revenue per destination resort health and wellness center in a period can be affected by the geographic mix of health and wellness centers in operation for such period. Typically our U.S. and Caribbean health and wellness centers are larger and produce substantially more revenues per location than our Asian centers. Additionally, average weekly revenue can also be negatively impacted by renovations of our destination resort health and wellness centers.

 Key Financial Definitions 
 Revenues. Revenues consist primarily of sales of services and sales of products to cruise ship passengers and destination resort guests. The following is a brief description of the components of our revenues: 
 Service revenues. Service revenues consist primarily of sales of health and wellness, aesthetics and fitness services, including a full range of body care, skin care, hair care, cosmetics, medi-spa, acupuncture, nutrition/weight management and mindfulness services, among others, to cruise ship passengers and destination resort guests. We bill our services at rates which inherently include an immaterial charge for products used in the rendering of such services, if applicable. 

Product revenues. Product revenues consist primarily of sales of health and wellness products, such as skincare, body care, hair care, orthotics, and nutritional supplements to cruise ship passengers, destination resort guests and timetospa.com customers. 

Cost of services. Cost of services consists primarily of an allocable portion of payments to cruise line partners (which are derived as a percentage of service revenues or a minimum annual rent or a combination of both), an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard employees, an allocable portion of staff-related shipboard expenses, wages paid directly to destination resort employees, payments to destination resort partners, the allocable cost of products consumed in the rendering of services, and health and wellness center depreciation. Most of the components of cost of services are variable in nature; increases and decreases in cost of services are primarily attributable to corresponding increases or decreases in service revenues. Cost of services has tended to remain materially consistent as a percentage of service revenues. 
 Cost of products. Cost of products consists primarily of the cost of products sold through our various methods of distribution, an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard employees and an allocable portion of payments to cruise line and destination resort partners (which are derived as a percentage of product revenues or a minimum annual rent or a combination of both). Most of the components of cost of products are variable in nature; increases and decreases in cost of products are primarily attributable to corresponding increases or decreases in product revenues and includes impairment of the carrying value of inventories. Cost of products has tended to remain materially consistent as a percentage of product revenues. 
 Administrative. Administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support our business, including fees for professional services, insurance, headquarters rent and other general corporate expenses. 
 Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes. Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes are comprised of employee expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support our business, including fees for employee salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, pension/401(k) and other employee costs. 
 Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets are comprised of the amortization of intangible assets with definite useful lives (e.g. retail concession agreements, destination resort agreements, licensing agreements). 
 Other income (expense). Other income (expense) consists of interest income, interest expense and changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities. 
 Income tax expense . Income tax expense includes current and deferred federal income tax expenses, as well as state and local income taxes. 
 Net income . Net income consists of income from operations less other income (expense) and income tax expense.

Revenue Drivers and Business Trends 
 Our revenues and financial performance are impacted by a multitude of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 The number of health and wellness centers we operate on cruise ships and in destination resorts . The number of cruise ships on which we operate during each period is primarily impacted by our renewal of existing cruise ship partner agreements, introductions of new ships to service under our existing agreements, agreements with new cruise line partners, ships temporarily out of service for maintenance and repair, and ships prevented from sailing due to outbreaks of illnesses, such as the recent pandemic, among other factors. The number of destination resorts in which we operate during each period is primarily attributable to renewal of existing agreements with destination resort partners and destination resorts prevented from operating due to outbreaks of illnesses, such as the recent pandemic, among other factors. 

The size and offerings of new health and wellness centers. We have focused on innovating and implementing higher value added and price point services such as medi-spa and advanced facial techniques, which require treatment rooms equipped with specific equipment and staff trained to perform these services. As our cruise line partners continue to invest in new ships with enhanced health and wellness centers that allow for more advanced treatment rooms and larger staff sizes, we are able to increase the availability of these services, driving an overall shift towards a more profitable service mix. 

Expansion of value-added services and products and increased pricing across modalities in existing health and wellness centers. We continue to introduce and expand our higher value added and price point offerings in existing health and wellness centers, including introducing premium medi-spa, acupuncture, and advanced facial services, resulting in higher guest demand and spending. In addition, we have increased pricing across our brands for our core services. 

The mix of ship count across contemporary, premium, luxury and budget categories. Revenue generated per shipboard health and wellness center differs across contemporary, premium, luxury and budget ship categories due to the size of the health and wellness centers, services offered and guest socioeconomic factors. 

The mix of cruise itineraries. Revenue generated per shipboard health and wellness center is influenced by cruise itinerary, including length of cruise, number of sea days versus port days, which impacts center utilization, and the geographic sailing region, which may impact ship category and offerings of services and products to align with guest socioeconomic mix and preferences. 

Collaboration with cruise line partners, including targeted marketing and promotion initiatives, as well as implementation of proprietary technologies to increase center utilization via pre-booking and pre-payment of health and wellness services. We directly market and promote to onboard passengers as a result of enhanced collaboration with certain of our cruise line partners. We also utilize our proprietary health and wellness services pre-booking and pre-payment technology platforms integrated with certain of our cruise line partners pre-cruise planning systems. These areas of increased collaboration with cruise line partners are resulting in higher productivity, revenue generation, and profitability across our health and wellness centers. 

The impact of weather. Our health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and in select destination resorts may be negatively affected by hurricanes, particularly during the August through October period, which may be increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. 

Our revenues and financial performance may be impacted by other risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth under the section entitled Risk Factors in Part II, Item 1A of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 

The effect of each of these factors on our revenues and financial performance varies from period to period.

 Comparison of Results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues . Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 241.7 million and 216.3 million, respectively. The increase primarily was attributable to our Average Ship Count increasing 5 to 195 health and wellness centers onboard ships operating during the quarter, compared with our Average Ship Count of 185 health and wellness centers onboard ships operating during the third quarter of 2023, together with continued productivity gains across our operations. In addition, we benefited from our initiatives to drive revenue growth in each of our on-board health and wellness centers through enhanced guest engagement and experiences, our guest service and product offering innovations, and the disciplined execution of our complex operating protocols by our on-board and corporate teams. 
 The break-down of revenue growth between service and product revenues was as follows: 
 Service revenues . Service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 194.4 million, an increase of 18.6 million, or 11 , compared to 175.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

23 

Product revenues. Product revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 47.3 million, an increase of 6.9 million, or 17 , compared to 40.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost of services . Cost of services for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 159.6 million, an increase of 13.5 million, or 9 , compared to 146.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily was attributable to costs associated with increased Service revenues of 194.4 million in the quarter compared with Service revenues of 175.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Cost of products . Cost of products for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 40.1 million, an increase of 5.7 million, or 16 , compared to 34.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily was attributable to costs associated with increased Product revenues of 47.3 million in the quarter compared to Product revenues of 40.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Administrative . Administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.2 million, a decrease of 0.4 million, or (9 ), compared to 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily was attributable to professional fees incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 for a secondary offering of common shares by selling shareholders related to the Business Combination. 
 Salary, benefits and payroll taxes . Salary, benefits and payroll taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 8.6 million, a decrease of 1.3 million, or (13 ), compared to 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily was attributable to the timing of higher performance based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Amortization of intangible assets . Amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 4.1 million and 4.2 million, respectively. 
 Other (expense) income . Other (expense) income includes interest expense and change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities. Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.5 million, a decrease of 1.2 million, or (33 ), compared to 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily was attributable to lower debt balances. Since the year ended December 31, 2022, we have repaid a total of 115.6 million in debt instruments. The change in fair value of the outstanding warrants during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was zero compared to a gain of 7.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributable to the fact that the Company had no outstanding warrants during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of the remeasurement to fair value of the warrants reflecting changes in market prices of our common stock and other observable inputs deriving the value of these financial instruments. 
 Income tax expense (benefit) . Income tax expense (benefit) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was an expense of 1.0 million, an increase of 3.8 million, or 134 , compared to an income tax benefit of 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of approximately 3.4 million in uncertain tax benefits during the third quarter of 2023 related to foreign tax exposures as a result of our participation in a tax amnesty program in Italy that settled such liability in August 2023. 
 Net income . Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.5 million, a decrease of 1.9 million, or 8 , compared to a net income of 23.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.9 million decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a 7.4 million negative change in fair value of warrant liabilities and a 3.8 million increase in income tax expense offset by a 1.2 million decrease in interest expense and an 8.1 million positive change in income from operations.

Cost of products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 110.8 million, an increase of 15.9 million, or 17 , compared to 94.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily was attributable to costs associated with increased Product revenues of 130.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from our operating health and wellness centers at sea and on land, compared to Product revenues of 110.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 25 

Administrative . Administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 13.0 million, an increase of 0.3 million, or 2 , compared to 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily was attributable to timing of professional fees incurred in connection with public company costs. 
 Salary, benefits and payroll taxes . Salary, benefits and payroll taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 26.3 million, a decrease of 1.4 million, or (5 ), compared to 27.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily was attributable to lower stock-based compensation expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 offset by annual merit increases for Corporate employees in 2024. 
 Amortization of intangible assets . Amortization of intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 12.4 million and 12.6 million, respectively. 
 Other income (expense) . Other income (expense) includes interest expense and change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities. Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.7 million, a decrease of 5.0 million, or (40 ), compared to 12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily was attributable to lower debt balances. Since the year ended December 31, 2022, we have repaid a total of 115.6 million in debt instruments. The change in fair value of the outstanding warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a gain of 7.7 million compared to a loss of 26.7) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities was the result of the remeasurement to fair value of the warrants exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting changes in market prices of our common stock and other observable inputs deriving the value of these financial instruments. The Company has no outstanding warrants as of September 30, 2024; accordingly, there will be no impact on the statement of operations in future periods. 
 Income tax expense (benefit) . Income tax expense (benefit) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an expense of 2.4 million, an increase of 4.6 million, or 207 , compared to an income tax benefit of 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily was driven by the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of approximately 3.4 million in uncertain tax benefits during the third quarter of 2023 related to foreign tax exposures as a result of our participation in a tax amnesty program in Italy that settled such liability in August 2023, offset by an increase in the taxable income, the change in valuation allowance and the decrease in availability of net operating losses. 
 Net income . Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 58.5 million, an increase of 54.1 million, or 1,250 , compared to a net income of 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 54.1 million increase in net income was primarily attributable to: (i) a 34.4 million positive change in fair value of warrant liabilities; (ii) a 5.0 million decrease in interest expense; and (iii) a 19.3 million positive change in income from operations; offset by 4.6 million increase in income tax expense. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We fund our operations principally with cash flow from operations. Our principal uses for our liquidity have been funding our health and wellness centers onboard 196 cruise ships and in 52 destination resorts, including associated working capital investment and capital expenditures; debt service, including 59.6 million repayment of our First Lien Term Loan Facility; purchasing 1,395,432 of our common shares from Steiner Leisure Limited pursuant to a Shares Repurchase Agreement, and purchasing 745,302 of our common shares under a Share Repurchase Program, among other uses of our liquidity. 
 On September 20, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries, Dory Acquisition Sub, Inc. and OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) Limited, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders party thereto, providing for senior secured credit facilities consisting of (x) a term loan facility of 100 million (of which 70 million was borrowed by Dory Acquisition and 30 million was borrowed by OneSpaWorld Bahamas), which was fully drawn on the Closing Date, and (y) a revolving loan facility of up to 50 million, which Revolving Facility remained undrawn upon the closing of the Credit Facilities and as of September 30, 2024. The Revolving Facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit up to 5 million. Any issuance of letters of credit reduces the amount available under the Revolving Facility. The Credit Facilities mature on September 20, 2029. 
 Loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR plus a margin of 1.90 , with three step ups to a maximum margin of 2.65 depending on the most recent consolidated leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, and undrawn amounts under the Revolving Facility will accrue a commitment fee at a rate per annum of 0.25 on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments thereunder, with three step ups to a maximum commitment fee of 0.40 depending on the most recent consolidated leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries . 
 The Term Loan Facility requires the Borrowers to make certain mandatory prepayments, with (i) 100 of net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property, subject to the ability to reinvest such proceeds and certain other exceptions, and (ii) 100 of the net cash proceeds of any debt incurrence, other than debt permitted under the definitive agreements (but excluding debt incurred to refinance the Credit Facilities). The Borrowers also are required to make quarterly amortization payments equal to 1.25 of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility commencing on March 31, 2025 (subject to reductions by optional and mandatory prepayments of 
 26 

the loans). The Borrowers may prepay the Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, subject to payment of customary breakage costs. 
 The proceeds from the Credit Facilities were used, together with cash on hand, to repay in full the remaining principal balance of the First Lien Term Loan Facility and to pay related financing costs of the Credit Facilities. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, our First Lien Term Loan Facility has been fully paid and terminated. 
 
 We have concluded that we will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our existing and planned capital requirements over the next twelve months and thereafter and comply with all debt covenants as required by our debt agreement.

Comparison of Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Operating activities . Our net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 62.2 million and 46.3 million, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net operating cash flows continued to increase from comparable 2023 periods, as the Company grew total revenue by 13 and income from operations by 46 and reduced interest expense by 40 , which interest expense reduction was attributable to repayment of indebtedness, further enhancing our balance sheet. 
 Investing activities . Our net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3.4 million and 2.9 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to make investments in computer hardware and software (including artificial intelligence) and Medi-spa equipment . 
 Financing activities . Our net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 37.9 million and 48.8 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received proceeds from the exercise of public and private warrants of 51.7 million, received proceeds from the Term Loan Facility of 100.0 million, repaid 159.6 million on the 
 27 

First Lien Term Loan Facility, paid 5.4 million of deleveraging fee on the First Lien Term Loan Facility, utilized 19.0 million to repurchase 1,351,688 of our common shares and 1.3 million to pay deferred financing cost. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repaid 36.0 million on the First Lien Term Loan Facility and 15.0 million on the Second Lien Term Loan Facility and received proceeds from the exercise of warrants of 2.2 million. 
 Seasonality 
 A significant portion of our revenues are generated onboard cruise ships and are subject to specific individual cruise itineraries, which are dependent on time of year and geographic location, among other factors. As a result, we experience varying degrees of seasonality as the demand for cruises is stronger in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months and during holidays. Accordingly, the third quarter and holiday periods generally result in higher revenues for us. Further, cruises and destination resorts have been negatively affected by the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, particularly during the August through October period, which may be increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, our future contractual obligations have not changed significantly from the amounts disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, management reevaluates its judgments and estimates, which are based on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
 Our critical accounting policies are included in our 2023 Form 10-K. We believe that there have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Inflation and Economic Conditions 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. However, public demand for activities, including cruises, is influenced by general economic conditions, including inflation, global health epidemics/pandemics and customer preferences. Periods of economic softness, increases in inflation rates and interest rates, as well as periods of fuel price increases, could have a material adverse effect on the cruise industry and hospitality industry upon which we are dependent and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 From time to time, including in this report and other disclosures, we may issue forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We attempt, whenever possible, to identify these statements by using words like will, may, could, should, would, believe, expect, anticipate, forecast, future, intend, plan, estimate and similar expressions of future intent or the negative of such terms.

changes in applicable laws or regulations;

other statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words estimate, plan, project, forecast, intend, expect, anticipate, believe, seek, target or similar expressions. 

These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this report and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date.
