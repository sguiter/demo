The Company recognized million in direct acquisition-related costs, which excluded integration-related activities that were expensed during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to million and million expensed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. These costs are included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, primarily within general and administrative expenses. The Company's results of operations included net sales from SeaSpine of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and net losses of million and million from SeaSpine for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. This compares to million and million of net sales from SeaSpine for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, and net losses of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Due to the consummation of the Merger occurring on January 5, 2023, all SeaSpine financial results for fiscal year 2023, except for the first four days of January, were included in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Therefore, the Company did not prepare unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 or 2024 , on the basis that the Merger was completed on January 1, 2023.

On January 10, 2024, the Company borrowed million under its senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") as part of its Financing Agreement with Blue Torch Finance LLC. On March 22, 2024, the secured delayed draw term loan facility (the "Delayed Draw Term Loan") of million was fully funded and the proceeds were used to repay the million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Financing Agreement contains financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a minimum level of liquidity at all times, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio (measured on a quarterly basis), and a minimum asset coverage ratio (measured on a monthly basis). As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all required financial covenants. On March 15, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No.1 to the Financing Agreement with Blue Torch Finance LLC (the "First Amendment"). Under the terms of the First Amendment, the parties agreed to reduce the number of business days to submit a notice of borrowing for the Delayed Draw Term Loan and redefine certain terms within the asset coverage financial covenant. The maturity date remains November 6, 2027, for each of the Initial Term Loan, Delayed Draw Term Loan, and Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had borrowings on its available lines of credit in Italy, which provide up to an aggregate amount of million million).

million, or million, at the date of issuance (the Convertible Loan ). In April 2024, the Company converted the Convertible Loan into shares of Neo Medical preferred equity securities. The preferred equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets and are considered an investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value. As such, the Company measures this investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The Company's equity investment with Neo Medical is subject to certain sales restrictions, such as right of first refusal, tag-along provisions, and drag-along provisions. Permitted transfers include (i) sales of shares to an affiliate of such shareholder, (ii) transfer of shares as part of a compensation package offered to employees, or (iii) Neo Medical may repurchase shares at a price no greater than that originally paid by the shareholder.

Other Investments Other investments represent assets and investments recorded at fair value that are not deemed to be material for disclosure on an individual basis. The fair value of these assets is based upon significant unobservable inputs, such as probability-weighted discounted cash flow models, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. Therefore, the Company has categorized these assets as Level 3 financial assets. Lattus Contingent Consideration In December 2022, prior to the consummation of the Merger, SeaSpine entered into a purchase agreement with Lattus Spine LLC ("Lattus") pursuant to which a contingent consideration obligation exists. Under the terms of the agreement, SeaSpine may be required to make installment payments at certain dates based on future net sales of certain products (the "Lateral Products").

former executives seek severance payments, as well as the value of forfeited equity grants under applicable change in control and severance agreements and further damages as a result of purported defamatory statements. The Company disagrees with many of the assertions contained in the written notices of arbitration claims and intends to vigorously defend the asserted claims. Due in part to the preliminary nature of this matter, the Company currently cannot reasonably estimate a possible loss, or range of loss, that may arise from the arbitration claims. Securities class action complaints On August 21, 2024, a securities class action complaint captioned Bernal v. Orthofix Medical Inc., et al., Case No. 24-cv-00690, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Texas (the Bernal Complaint ). The plaintiff, a purported Company shareholder, alleges through the complaint violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and names as defendants the Company and the following former Company directors and officers: Jon Serbousek (former director and former President and Chief Executive Officer), Keith Valentine (former director and former President and Chief Executive Officer), John Bostjancic (former Chief Financial Officer), and Patrick Keran (former Chief Legal

million shares for agreements that must be settled in shares of the Company's stock. The Company has received notification from one such distributor, who has notified the Company of its decision to exercise its buyout option. The Company is currently in negotiations with this distributor in regards to the consummation of the potential acquisition. Italian Medical Device Payback IMDP In 2015, the Italian Parliament introduced rules for entities that supply goods and services to the Italian National Healthcare System. A key provision of the law is a payback measure, requiring medical device companies in Italy to make payments to the Italian government if medical device expenditures exceed regional maximum ceilings. Companies are required to make payments equal to a percentage of expenditures exceeding maximum regional caps. In the third quarter of 2022, the Italian Ministry of Health provided guidelines to the Italian regions and provinces on seeking payback of expenditure overruns relating to the 2015 through 2018 calendar years. Since receiving the guidelines, several regions and provinces have requested payment from affected medical device companies, including the Company. The Company has taken legal action to dispute the legality of such measures. In July 2024, the Italian Constitutional Court issued two judgments following public hearings on the matter held in May 2024. These judgments (i) declared the payback system itself as constitutionally legitimate and (ii) extended previously communicated reductions in the payback liability for certain fiscal years to all medical device companies, regardless of whether or not they had waived their legal claims on the matter. The Company accounts for the estimated cost of the IMDP as sales and marketing expense and periodically reassesses the liability based upon current facts and circumstances. As a result, the Company recorded an expense of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and an expense of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has accrued million related to the IMDP, which it has classified within other long-term liabilities; however, the actual liability could be higher or lower than the amount accrued once all legal proceedings are resolved and upon further clarification of the IMDP by the Italian authorities for more recent fiscal years.

These reporting segments represent the operating segments for which the President and Chief Executive Officer, who is also the CODM, reviews financial information and makes resource allocation decisions among businesses. The primary metric used by the CODM in managing the Company is adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization adjusted EBITDA , a non-GAAP financial measure). Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and excludes the impact of share-based compensation, gains and losses related to changes in foreign exchange rates, charges related to the SeaSpine merger and other strategic investments, acquisition-related fair value adjustments, gains and/or losses on investments, litigation and investigation charges, charges related to initial compliance with regulations set forth by the European Union Medical Device Regulation, and succession charges. Corporate activities are comprised of operating expenses not directly identifiable within the two reporting segments, such as human resources, finance, legal, and information technology functions. The Company neither discretely allocates assets, other than goodwill, to its operating segments nor evaluates the operating segments using discrete asset information. Global Spine The Global Spine reporting segment offers two primary product categories: (i) Bone Growth Therapies and (ii) Spinal Implants, Biologics, and Enabling Technologies. The Bone Growth Therapies product category manufactures, distributes, sells, and provides support services for market-leading devices used adjunctively in high-risk spinal fusion procedures and to treat both nonunion and acute fractures in the orthopedic space. These Class III medical devices are indicated as an adjunctive, noninvasive treatment to improve fusion success rates in the cervical and lumbar spine as well as a therapeutic treatment for non-spine acute and nonunion fractures. This product category uses distributors and a direct sales channel to sell its devices to hospitals, healthcare providers, and patients, in the U.S. Spinal Implants, Biologics, and Enabling Technologies is comprised of (i) a broad portfolio of spine fixation and motion preservation implant products used in surgical procedures of the spine, (ii) one of the most comprehensive biologics portfolios in both the demineralized bone matrix and cellular allograft market segments, and (iii) image-guided surgical solutions to facilitate degenerative, minimally invasive, and complex surgical procedures. Spinal Implants, Biologics, and Enabling Technologies products are sold through a network of distributors and sales representatives to hospitals and healthcare providers on a global basis for Spinal Implants and Enabling Technologies, and primarily within the U.S. for Biologics. Global Orthopedics The Global Orthopedics reporting segment offers products and solutions for limb deformity correction and complex limb reconstruction with a focus on use in trauma, adult and pediatric limb reconstruction, and foot and ankle procedures. This reporting segment specializes in the design, development, and marketing of external and internal fixation orthopedic products that are coupled with enabling digital technologies to serve the complete patient treatment pathway. We sell these products through a global network of distributors and sales representatives to hospitals, healthcare organizations, and healthcare providers.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the equity awards of SeaSpine (including stock options and restricted stock units) outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger were converted into equity awards denominated in shares of Orthofix common stock. The Company issued options to purchase million shares of Orthofix common stock and million shares of time-based vesting restricted stock units in connection with the conversion of such awards. The estimated fair value of the portion of the SeaSpine equity awards for which the required service period had been completed at the time of the closing of the Merger was treated as purchase consideration. The remaining estimated fair value is recorded as compensation expense over the remainder of the service period associated with the awards. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 , the Company issued million and less than million shares, respectively, of common stock related to stock purchase plan issuances, stock option exercises, and the vesting of restricted stock awards and units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 , the Company issued million and million shares, respectively, of common stock related to stock purchase plan issuances, stock option exercises, and the vesting of restricted stock awards and units. Inducement plans During 2024, the Company has appointed several new executives, including a new President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief People Business Operations Officer, Chief Legal Officer, President of Global Spine, Chief Investor Relations and Communications Officer, President of Global Operations and Quality, Chief Human Resources Officer, and President of Global Orthopedics. As inducements to accept employment with the Company, the individuals were awarded grants including, dependent on the individual, (i) market-based and/or time-based stock options, (ii) time-based restricted stock units, (iii) time-based cliff vesting restricted stock units, and (iv) market-based restricted stock units, with an aggregate value across all award types of approximately million. and , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the effective tax rate was and , respectively. The primary factors affecting the Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were certain losses not benefited and tax amortization on certain acquired intangibles. We were notified in October 2024 that the Italian Tax Agency would begin an audit of the Company's subsidiary in Italy for the 2020 tax year. The Company cannot reasonably determine if this examination will have a material impact on its financial statements and cannot predict the timing regarding resolution of the tax examination.

Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from operating activities increased 41.1 million 
 Favorable change in net loss of 32.4 million 

Unfavorable change of 4.2 million associated with non-cash gains and losses, such as amortization of the inventory fair value step-up recognized in the Merger, share-based compensation, inventory reserve expenses, depreciation and amortization, and gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of certain assets and liabilities 

Favorable change of 13.0 million relating to changes in working capital accounts, primarily attributable to changes in inventories, accounts payable, and other current liabilities

Decrease in net proceeds of 0.7 million from the issuance of common shares 

Credit Facilities 
 On November 6, 2023, we entered into a Financing Agreement (the Financing Agreement with Blue Torch Finance LLC and certain lenders party thereto. The Financing Agreement provides for a 100.0 million senior secured term loan (the Initial Term Loan ), a 25.0 million senior secured delayed draw term loan facility (the Delayed Draw Term Loan ), and a 25.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility, and together with the Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan, the Credit Facilities ), each of which mature on November 6, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had 100.0 million outstanding under the Initial Term Loan and 25.0 million outstanding under the Delayed Draw Term Loan. 
 The Financing Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum level of liquidity at all times, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio (measured on a quarterly basis), and a minimum asset coverage ratio (measured on a monthly basis). As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all required financial covenants. 
 On March 15, 2024, we entered into Amendment No.1 to the Financing Agreement with Blue Torch Finance LLC (the "First Amendment"). Under the terms of the First Amendment, the parties agreed to reduce the number of business days to submit a notice of borrowing for the Delayed Draw Term Loan and redefine certain terms within the asset coverage financial covenant. The maturity date remains November 6, 2027, for each of the Initial Term Loan, Delayed Draw Term Loan, and Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings on our available lines of credit in Italy, which provide up to an aggregate amount of 5.5 million 6.1 million). 
 On November 7, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and its U.S. subsidiaries entered into a 275 million secured credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC, as administrative agent and as collateral agent Oxford and certain lenders party thereto, including Oxford and K2 Healthventures LLC. Certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are expected to join the New Credit Agreement as guarantors shortly after the signing date. The New Credit Agreement provides for a 160 million senior secured term loan (the Initial Term Loan ), and a 65 million senior secured delayed draw term loan facility (the Term B Loan ). Draws under the Term B Loan are at the Company s option from January 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026, subject to, among other conditions, the Company s continuing compliance with a pro-forma total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of less than 4.0x. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents earnings before interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other negotiated addbacks and adjustments. In addition, at Oxford's discretion, an additional 50 million of draw capacity is available to the Company, through January 1, 2029 (the Term C Loan and, together with the Term B Loan, the Delayed Draw Term Loans and collectively with the Initial Term Loan, the Credit Facilities ). The Initial Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loans, to the extent ultimately drawn, will each mature in November 2029, following an interest-only payment period ending December 2028, and monthly amortization of principal and accrued interest between January 2029 and November 2029. 
 The Credit Facilities will be secured by a perfected first priority lien, or the equivalent security interest in each applicable jurisdiction, on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the applicable guarantors (subject to customary carveouts), including their respective U.S. intellectual property assets. 
 The Company expects to promptly fund the Initial Term Loan under the New Credit Agreement to repay all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility with Blue Torch Finance LLC and terminate the Financing Agreement with Blue Torch. In addition to the repayment of existing debt, borrowings under the New Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. 
 29 

Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at a percentage rate equal to the greater of 8.75 or 5.75 plus the one-month term SOFR rate. A facility fee equal to 1.5 of each applicable funded loan tranche is due at the time of funding of such respective tranche, and a 0.5 unused line fee is payable annually on the Term B Loan. 
 The New Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the Company s and its subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make certain investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of certain assets, pay dividends and distributions, pay subordinated indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transactions, as well as financial covenants that the Company (i) possess at least 45 million of unrestricted cash at the time the Initial Term Loan is funded and thereafter maintain 15 million of unrestricted cash in U.S.-based accounts, and (ii) maintain a maximum total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio no greater than 4.0x during the term of the facility. 
 The Company believes it will be in compliance with the covenants in future fiscal quarters. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be in such compliance, and if it is not, the failure to do so could result in an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position in the event that it continues to have significant amounts drawn under the Credit Facilities at such time.

 For information regarding contingencies, see Note 8 to the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. 
 Lattus Spine LLC ("Lattus") Contingent Consideration 
 Under the terms of a contingent consideration obligation in a purchase agreement assumed in the Merger, we may be required to make installment payments at certain dates based on future net sales of certain products (the "Lateral Products"). The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement as of September 30, 2024, was 14.7 million; however, the actual amount ultimately paid could be higher or lower than the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. As of September 30, 2024, we classified the remaining contingent consideration liability of 6.6 million and 8.1 million within other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively. For additional discussion of this matter, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Legion Innovations, LLC Asset Acquisition 
 On December 29, 2022, we entered into a technology assignment and royalty agreement with Legion Innovations, LLC, a U.S.-based medical device technology company, whereby we acquired intellectual property rights to certain assets. As consideration, we paid 0.2 million in January 2023, with additional payments contingent upon reaching future commercialization and revenue-based milestones. 
 IGEA S.p.A Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement 
 In April 2021, we entered into an Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement (the License Agreement with IGEA S.p.A IGEA ), an Italian manufacturer and distributor of bone and cartilage stimulation systems. As consideration for the License Agreement, we agreed to pay up to 4.0 million, of which 0.5 million was paid in 2021, with certain payments contingent upon achieving an FDA milestone. 
 In May 2022, we received FDA approval for the acquired technology, which triggered a contingent consideration milestone obligation of 3.5 million. Of this amount, 1.5 million was paid in 2022, 1.0 million was paid in May 2023, and the remaining 1.0 million was paid in July 2024. 
 Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes in any of our material contractual obligations as disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion of operating results is based upon the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our critical accounting estimates are described in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the quarter covered by this report. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 of the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information regarding the status of recently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by senior management in its financial and operational decision-making. We believe it is important to provide investors with the same non-GAAP financial measures used to supplement information regarding the performance and underlying trends of our business operations to facilitate comparisons to historical operating results and internally evaluate the effectiveness of our operating strategies. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of our underlying operating performance with other companies in the industry that also supplement their U.S. GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures used in this filing may have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Some limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude items that reflect an economic cost that can have a material effect on cash flows. 
 Constant Currency 
 Constant currency is calculated by using foreign currency rates from the comparable, prior year period to present net sales at comparable rates. Constant currency can be presented for numerous U.S. GAAP measures but is most commonly used by management to analyze net sales without the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash from operating activities. Management uses free cash flow as an important indicator of how much cash is generated or used by our normal business operations, including capital expenditures. Management uses free cash flow as a measure of progress on its capital efficiency and cash flow initiatives. 
 
 I tem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes to our market risks as disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 I tem 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 At the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. As described below, as of December 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which is an integral component of our disclosure controls and procedures. Our remediation efforts with respect to this material weakness are continuing, and we have determined that this material weakness is continuing as of September 30, 2024, as there have been no further control instances as of this date to conclude that the applicable controls have been remediated. As a result, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those 
 31 

policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of the inherent limitations in any internal control, no matter how well designed, misstatements may occur and not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline. 
 In connection with the preparation and filing of the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ), the Company s management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Based on its evaluation, the Company s management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023, due to a material weakness in the design and operation of certain management review controls pertaining to business combinations and assessing recoverability of goodwill, resulting from insufficient evidence supporting the precision over the determination of certain estimates and insufficient evidence supporting the operating effectiveness of the associated review controls. This material weakness did not result in any misstatements to the consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 
 Notwithstanding the material weakness, management has concluded that the financial statements included elsewhere in the 2023 Annual Report presented fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 Remediation of the Material Weakness 
 Our management has worked, and continues to work, to strengthen our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in connection with the material weakness described above. Subsequent to the identification of the material weakness, the Company has better aligned its current finance department staff to enhance the review and oversight of the accounting and finance functions. The Company has also added several key positions in its finance department, including a new Chief Financial Officer, a Senior Vice President of Finance and Strategy, and other supporting roles with backgrounds in financial reporting, technical accounting, and financial planning and analysis. The Company continues to implement the remediation efforts described herein. These remediation efforts are being undertaken under the supervision of the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 We are in the process of implementing and continuing to refine the plan for remediation of the ineffective internal control over financial reporting described above. In addition, we have designed and are implementing the specific remediation initiatives described below: 
 Evaluating skill set gaps and hiring additional accounting, finance, and/or financial reporting personnel, as needed, with relevant public company accounting and financial reporting experience to develop and implement additional policies, procedures, and controls as it pertains to business combinations, asset acquisitions, and/or other processes heavily dependent on the usage of prospective financial information; 

Providing ongoing training for key personnel responsible for internal control over financial reporting; and 

Enhancing and/or implementing new controls over the completeness and accuracy of information used in financial reporting and forecasted financial results, particularly as it relates to the accounting for business combinations and goodwill impairment assessments. 

We believe the remediation steps outlined above have improved and will continue to improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are committed to remediating the material weakness and we are making progress in that effort. The actions we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight from the Audit and Finance Committee. When fully implemented and operational, we believe the measures described above will remediate the underlying 
 32 

causes of the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness and will strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. However, remediation efforts are expected to continue beyond the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Further, we will not be able to fully remediate this material weakness until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. We may also identify additional measures that may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, necessitating further action. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the remediation activities described above, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 For information regarding legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as follows: 
 Ongoing litigation and arbitration matters could negatively affect our business operations. 
 In September 2023, following an investigation conducted by independent outside legal counsel, our Board of Directors terminated the employment of Keith Valentine, John Bostjancic, and Patrick Keran, who had served respectively as the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Legal Officer. The Company notified each of Messrs. Valentine, Bostjancic, and Keran that their respective terminations were being made for Cause, as defined in applicable employment-related agreements (including each executive s respective Change in Control and Severance Agreement, dated June 19, 2023). 
 Several litigation and arbitration matters against the Company (and in certain cases, current and former directors and officers) are pending in connection with these terminations. These matters include (i) arbitration claims by the three former executives against the Company for alleged breach of contract, defamation, false light invasion of privacy and deceit in connection with such terminations of employment, including payment of severance amounts and the value of forfeited equity grants, (ii) securities class action complaints alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with the Company s public disclosures during the periods preceding such terminations, and (iii) a derivative complaint alleging claims against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors based on the same allegations made in the securities class action complaints. Additional lawsuits or proceedings against the Company and/or its current or former directors and officers in connection with these matters may be filed in the future. 
 In the event that any of these claims, or other future related or unrelated claims, are successful, they could result in costs to us that could negatively affect our near-term liquidity and financial condition. In addition, these matters may also divert management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of our business while such claims proceed. 
 We maintain a 275 million secured credit facility secured by a pledge of substantially all of our property. 
 On November 7, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and its U.S. subsidiaries entered into a 275 million secured credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC, as administrative agent and as collateral agent Oxford and certain lenders party thereto, including Oxford and K2 Healthventures LLC. Certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are expected to join the New Credit Agreement as guarantors shortly after the signing date. The New Credit Agreement provides for a 160 million senior secured term loan (the Initial Term Loan ), and a 65 million senior secured delayed draw term loan facility (the Term B Loan ). Draws under the Term B Loan are at the Company s option from January 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026, subject to, among other conditions, the Company s continuing compliance with a pro-forma total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of less than 4.0x. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents earnings before interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other negotiated addbacks and adjustments. In addition, at Oxford's discretion, an additional 50 million of draw capacity is available to the Company, through January 1, 2029 (the Term C Loan and, together with the Term B Loan, the Delayed Draw Term Loans and collectively with the Initial Term Loan, the Credit Facilities ). The Initial Term Loan and Delayed Draw Term Loans, to the extent ultimately drawn, will each mature in November 2029, following an interest-only payment period ending December 2028, and monthly amortization of principal and accrued interest between January 2029 and November 2029. 
 The Credit Facilities will be secured by a perfected first priority lien, or the equivalent security interest in each applicable jurisdiction, on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the applicable guarantors (subject to customary carveouts), including their respective U.S. intellectual property assets. 
 The Company expects to promptly fund the Initial Term Loan under the New Credit Agreement to repay all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility with Blue Torch Finance LLC and terminate the Financing Agreement with Blue Torch. In addition to the repayment of existing debt, borrowings under the New Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at a percentage rate equal to the greater of 8.75 or 5.75 plus the one-month term SOFR rate. A facility fee equal to 1.5 of each applicable funded loan tranche is due at the time of funding of such respective tranche, and a 0.5 unused line fee is payable annually on the Term B Loan. 
 34 

The New Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the Company s and its subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make certain investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of certain assets, pay dividends and distributions, pay subordinated indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transactions, as well as financial covenants that the Company (i) possess at least 45 million of unrestricted cash at the time the Initial Term Loan is funded and thereafter maintain 15 million of unrestricted cash in U.S.-based accounts, and (ii) maintain a maximum total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio no greater than 4.0x during the term of the facility. 
 We believe that we will be in compliance with the covenants in future fiscal quarters. However, there can be no assurance that we will be in such compliance, and if we are not, the failure to do so could result in an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position in the event that we continue to have significant amounts drawn under the facility at such time. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 We have not made any repurchases of our common stock during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upo n Senior Securities 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4. Mine Saf ety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the last fiscal quarter, none of our (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) , or any contract, instruction, or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act or any "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement."

Exhibit 10.8 

 ORTHOFIX MEDICAL INC. 
 CHANGE IN CONTROL AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENT 
 This AGREEMENT (the Agreement is made and entered into as of June 10, 2024 (the Effective Date ), by and between Orthofix Medical Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the Company ), and Max Reinhardt (the Executive ). 
 RECITALS 
 WHEREAS, the Executive is expected to make significant contributions to the profitability, growth and financial strength of the Company; 
 WHEREAS, the Company believes that it is important to provide the Executive with severance benefits upon certain terminations of employment to provide the Executive with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to remain with the Company; 
 WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that the possibility of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) and the uncertainty that it would cause could result in the departure or distraction of the Executive, to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders; and 
 WHEREAS, the Company desires to encourage the continued employment of the Executive by the Company and wants assurance that it shall have the continued dedication, loyalty and service of, and the availability of objective advice and counsel from, the Executive notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change in Control; 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
 1. Definitions . As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings, which are equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined: 

(a) 2012 LTIP shall mean the Company s 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and/or restated from time-to-time (including after the Effective Date).

In the event that any of the severance payments and other benefits provided by this Agreement or otherwise payable to the Executive (a) constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (b) but for this Section 7, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code Excise Tax ), then the Executive s severance payments and benefits under this Agreement or otherwise shall be payable either in full or in such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such severance payments or benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance payments and benefits under this Agreement or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance payments or benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Any reduction in the severance payments and benefits required by this Section 7 shall be made in the following order: (i) reduction of cash payments; (ii) reduction of accelerated vesting of equity awards other than stock options; (iii) reduction of accelerated vesting of stock options; and (iv) reduction of other benefits paid or provided to the Executive. The calculations and establishment of assumptions in this Section 7 will be performed by a professional tax firm engaged by the Company as of the day prior to the applicable CiC Date. If the tax firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the acquiring company, the Company shall appoint a nationally recognized tax firm to make the determinations required by this Section 7. The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such firm required to be made by this Section 7. The Company and the Executive shall furnish such tax firm such information and documents as the tax firm may reasonably request in order to make its required determination. The tax firm will provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Company and the Executive as soon as practicable following its engagement. Any good faith determinations of the tax firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and the Executive. However, the Executive shall have the final authority to make any good faith determination(s) associated with the assumptions used by the tax firm in providing its calculations, and such good faith determination by the Executive shall be binding on the Company. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 409A, 280G or 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the professional tax firm described in this Section 7, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS or other agency will claim that an Excise Tax greater than that amount, if any, determined by such professional firm for the purposes of this Section 7 is due (the Additional Excise Tax ). The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the IRS or other agency that, if successful, would require payment of Additional Excise Tax. The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with respect to payments made or due to the Executive. The Company shall pay all reasonable fees, expenses and penalties of the Executive relating to a claim by the IRS or other agency. In the event it is finally determined that a further reduction would have been required under this Section 7 to place the Executive in a better after-tax position, the Executive shall repay the Company such amount within 30 days thereof in order to effect such result. 

8. Section 409A . 

(a) For purposes of Section 409A of the Code Section 409A (i) each payment (as defined by Section 409A) made under this Agreement shall be considered a separate payment, and (ii) payments shall be deemed exempt from the definition of deferred compensation under Section 409A to the fullest extent possible under (x) the short-term deferral exemption of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(4), and (y) with respect to amounts paid as separation pay (as defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(m)) no later than the second calendar year following the calendar year containing the Executive s

(c) If the Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A (and as applied according to procedures of the Company and its affiliates) as of the Executive s separation from service, to the extent any payment under this Agreement constitutes deferred compensation (after taking into account any applicable exemptions from Section 409A) that is payable upon a separation from service, and to the extent required in order to avoid the imposition of an excise tax or penalties under Section 409A, no payments due under this Agreement may be made until the earlier of: (1) the date of the Executive s death and (2) the first day of the seventh month following the Executive s separation from service, provided, however, that any payments delayed during this six-month period shall be paid in the aggregate in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the Executive s separation from service (or upon the date of the Executive s death, if earlier).

Any purported assignment by the Executive shall be null and void from the initial date of purported assignment. 

(g) Severability . If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, then the Agreement will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to render the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision, and the rest of the Agreement, valid and enforceable. If a court or other adjudicator declines to amend the Agreement, the invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, which shall be enforced as if the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had not been included in this Agreement. 

(h) Waiver . A waiver by the Company of a breach of any provisions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach, nor shall recourse to any remedy hereunder be a 

Page 14 

waiver of any other or further relief or remedy. No waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an officer of the Company.

7. Section 280G . In the event that any of the severance payments and other benefits provided by this Agreement or otherwise payable to the Executive (a) constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (b) but for this Section 7, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code Excise Tax ), then the Executive s severance payments and benefits under this Agreement or otherwise shall be payable either in full or in such lesser amount which would result in no portion of such severance payments or benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by the Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance payments and benefits under this Agreement or otherwise, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance payments or benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.

The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such firm required to be made by this Section 7. The Company and the Executive shall furnish such tax firm such information and documents as the tax firm may reasonably request in order to make its required determination. The tax firm will provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Company and the Executive as soon as practicable following its engagement.

However, the Executive shall have the final authority to make any good faith determination(s) associated with the assumptions used by the tax firm in providing its calculations, and such good faith determination by the Executive shall be binding on the Company. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Sections 409A, 280G or 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the professional tax firm described in this Section 7, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS or other agency will claim that an Excise Tax greater than that amount, if any, determined by such professional firm for the purposes of this Section 7 is due (the Additional Excise Tax ). The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the IRS or other agency that, if successful, would require payment of Additional Excise Tax. The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with respect to payments made or due to the Executive. The Company shall pay all reasonable fees, expenses and penalties of the Executive relating to a claim by the IRS or other agency.

(c) If the Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A (and as applied according to procedures of the Company and its affiliates) as of the Executive s separation from service, to the extent any payment under this Agreement constitutes deferred compensation (after taking into account any applicable exemptions from Section 409A) that is payable upon a separation from service, and to the extent required in order to avoid the imposition of an excise tax or penalties under Section 409A, no payments due under this Agreement may be made until the earlier of: (1) the date of the Executive s death and (2) the first day of the seventh month following the Executive s separation from service, provided, however, that any payments delayed during this six-month period shall be paid in the aggregate in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the Executive s separation from service (or upon the date of the Executive s death, if earlier).
