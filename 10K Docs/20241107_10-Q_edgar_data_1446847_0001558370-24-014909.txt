 , the Company completed the VectivBio Acquisition. The aggregate consideration paid by the Company to acquire the shares accepted for payment was approximately billion. The Company financed the acquisition through proceeds from the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined elsewhere below) and cash on hand. The total purchase consideration for VectivBio is as follows (in thousands): Cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio restricted stock units RSUs and stock options (2) Cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio warrants (3) Transaction costs Fair value of noncontrolling interest (4) Total purchase consideration 

 (1) The cash consideration paid to selling shareholders was determined based on the total number of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio (the VectivBio Shares tendered at closing of at a per share price of . (2) The cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio RSUs and stock options issued under VectivBio s equity incentive plans was determined based on the total number of underlying VectivBio Shares of at a per share price of , less the exercise price for stock options. (3) The cash consideration paid to settle VectivBio warrants was determined based on the total number of VectivBio warrant shares outstanding at close of at a per share price of calculated as the per share price of , less the exercise price of per share. (4) T he fair value of the noncontrolling interest was determined based on the total number of VectivBio Shares outstanding at closing of at the closing date of the tender offer, using the VectivBio closing share price on June 28, 2023 of . On December 12, 2023, the Company completed the Squeeze-out Merger and paid million to acquire all remaining outstanding VectivBio Shares in cash. As of December 31, 2023, there was remaining noncontrolling interest in VectivBio. The VectivBio Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition under Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in a single identifiable in-process research and development IPR D asset, apraglutide, VectivBio s lead investigational asset. Apraglutide is a next-generation, long-acting synthetic GLP-2 analog being developed for a range of rare GI diseases for the potential treatment of SBS-IF. The Company recognized the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the consideration paid, inclusive of transaction costs, on a relative fair value basis. In accordance with the accounting for asset acquisitions, an entity that acquires IPR D assets in an asset acquisition follows the guidance in ASC Topic 730 Research and Development , which requires that both tangible and intangible identifiable research and development assets with no alternative future use be allocated a portion of the consideration transferred and recorded as research and development expense at the acquisition date. As a result, the Company recorded approximately billion in acquired IPR D expense related to the apraglutide IPR D asset during the second quarter of 2023. The following is the allocation of the purchase consideration based on the relative fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company (in thousands):

The Company records its share of the net profits or net losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. less commercial expenses on a net basis, and presents the settlement payments to and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. This treatment is in accordance with the Company s revenue recognition policy, given that the Company is not the primary obligor and does not have the inventory risks in the collaboration agreement with AbbVie for North America.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred an insignificant amount and million of restructuring expenses, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred million and million of restructuring expenses, respectively. The restructuring expenses are comprised primarily of employee severance, benefits, and related costs. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Information The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on February 16, 2024, or the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Overview We are a gastrointestinal, or GI, healthcare company dedicated to advancing the treatment of GI diseases and redefining the standard of care for GI patients. We are focused on the development and commercialization of innovative GI product opportunities in areas of significant unmet need, leveraging our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases. LINZESS (linaclotide), our commercial product, is the first product approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or U.S. FDA, in a class of GI medicines called guanylate cyclase type C agonists, or GC-C agonists, and is indicated for adult men and women suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, or chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC, and for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old suffering from functional constipation, or FC. LINZESS is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in the United States, or the U.S., Mexico, and Saudi Arabia, adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or chronic constipation in Japan, and IBS-C in China, and pediatric patients ages 6-17 with FC in the U.S. Linaclotide is available under the trademarked name CONSTELLA to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC and pediatric patients ages 6-17 years old with FC in Canada, and to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C in certain European countries. We have strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies to support the development and commercialization of linaclotide throughout the world, including with AbbVie Inc. (together with its affiliates), or AbbVie, in the U.S. and all countries worldwide other than China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Japan, AstraZeneca AB (together with its affiliates), or AstraZeneca, in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, in Japan. We also aim to leverage our leading development and commercialization capabilities in GI to bring additional treatment options to GI patients.

 In June 2023, we completed a tender offer to purchase 98 of the outstanding ordinary shares of VectivBio Holding AG, or the VectivBio Acquisition. In December 2023, we completed a squeeze-out merger under Swiss law to acquire all remaining shares and VectivBio Holding AG was merged with and into Ironwood Pharmaceuticals GmbH, our wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland. The VectivBio Acquisition was partially funded with 400.0 million of borrowings under a new revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, as further described in Note 9, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Through the acquisition, we are advancing apraglutide, a next-generation, synthetic peptide analog of glucagon-like peptide-2, or GLP-2, for rare gastrointestinal diseases, including short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure, or SBS-IF. In November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license option agreement, or the COUR Collaboration Agreement, with COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc., or COUR, that granted us an option to acquire an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize, in the U.S., products containing CNP-104, a tolerizing immune modifying nanoparticle, for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. In the third quarter of 2024, we received from COUR the topline data from COUR s Phase II Clinical study for the treatment of PBC. In September 2024, we notified COUR of our decision not to exercise the option to acquire an exclusive license to CNP-104. As a result, the collaboration and license option agreement between COUR and us has terminated, and we retain no rights and have no obligations related to CNP-104. We are also advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome, or IC/BPS, and endometriosis. We have decided to end further recruitment for the Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS and analyze the data once all currently enrolled patients complete the full 12-week study assessment, which will inform the next steps on the program. To date, we have dedicated a majority of our activities to the research, development and commercialization of linaclotide, as well as to the research and development of our other product candidates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income of 3.6 million and net loss of 1.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded net income of 14.0 million and net loss of approximately 1.0 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 1.7 billion. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or guarantee that our company will be able to maintain positive cash flows. We were incorporated in Delaware on January 5, 1998 as Microbia, Inc. On April 7, 2008, we changed our name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We operate in one reportable business segment human therapeutics. Financial Operations Overview Revenues. Our revenues are generated primarily through our collaborative arrangements and license agreements related to research and development and commercialization of linaclotide. The majority of our revenues are generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. We record our share of the net profits and losses from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. less commercial expenses on a net basis and present the settlement payments to and from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, as applicable. Net profits or losses consist of net sales to third-party customers and sublicense income in the U.S. less the cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. Although we expect net sales to increase over time, the settlement payments between AbbVie and us, resulting in collaborative arrangements revenue or collaboration expense, are subject to fluctuation based on the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by each party. In addition, our collaborative arrangements revenue may fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of license fees and clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships as well as timing and amount of royalties from the sales of linaclotide in the European, Canadian, Mexican, Japanese, or Chinese markets or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval and is commercialized. Research and Development Expense. The core of our research and development strategy is to leverage our demonstrated expertise and capabilities in GI diseases to bring multiple medicines to patients. Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the research into and development of products and product candidates. These expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, research and development related facility costs, third-party contract costs relating to nonclinical study and

Table of Contents 
 clinical trial activities, development of manufacturing processes, regulatory registration of third-party manufacturing facilities, and licensing fees for our product candidates. Research and development expenses include amounts owed to AbbVie on an ongoing basis under cost-sharing provisions in our collaboration agreement for linaclotide. Reimbursements received for research and development activities under this agreement are netted against research and development expenses. Linaclotide . Our commercial product, LINZESS, is commercially available in the U.S. for the treatment of IBS-C or CIC in adults and for FC in pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old. Linaclotide is also available to adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC in certain countries of the world, including China, Japan, and in a number of European countries. We and AbbVie continue to explore ways to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. In September 2020, based on the Phase IIIb data of linaclotide 290 mcg on the overall abdominal symptoms of bloating, pain and discomfort in adult patients with IBS-C, the U.S. FDA approved our supplemental new drug application to include a more comprehensive description of the effects of LINZESS in its approved label. In addition, we and AbbVie have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients. In August 2021, the U.S. FDA approved a revised label for LINZESS based on clinical safety data that had been generated thus far in pediatric studies. The updated label modified the boxed warning for risk of serious dehydration and contraindication against use in children to those less than two years of age. The boxed warning and contraindication previously applied to all children less than 18 years of age and less than 6 years of age, respectively. In June 2023, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for pediatric patients ages 6-17 years-old with FC, making LINZESS the first and only FDA-approved prescription therapy for FC in this patient population. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in patients with FC less than 6 years of age or in patients with IBS-C less than 18 years of age have not been established. Additional clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and FC are ongoing. Apraglutide for SBS-IF . In February 2024, we announced positive topline results from our pivotal Phase III clinical trial, STARS, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous apraglutide in reducing parenteral support, or PS, dependency in adult patients with SBS-IF. SBS-IF, a rare and severe organ failure condition in which patients are dependent on PS, affects an estimated 18,000 adult patients in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Based on these results, we plan to submit a new drug application and other regulatory filings as a once-weekly GLP-2 analog for apraglutide for use in adult patients with SBS who are dependent on PS. Apraglutide for aGvHD. In March 2024, we announced positive, primary results up to Day 91 for our Phase II exploratory trial, STARGAZE, to evaluate apraglutide in patients with steroid-refractory gastrointestinal acute Graft versus Host Disease, or aGvHD, which evaluated the safety and tolerability of once-weekly apraglutide in aGvHD patients treated with standard of care, including systemic corticosteroids and ruxolitinib. The STARGAZE study will continue through its two-year endpoint, where apraglutide will be re-evaluated for safety and efficacy. CNP-104. Through the COUR Collaboration Agreement, we and COUR developed CNP-104 for the treatment of PBC, a rare autoimmune disease targeting the liver. In the third quarter of 2024, we received from COUR the topline data from COUR s Phase II Clinical study for the treatment of PBC. In September 2024, we notified COUR of our decision not to exercise the option to acquire an exclusive license to CNP-104. As a result, the COUR Collaboration Agreement has terminated, and we retain no rights and have no obligations related to CNP-104. IW-3300 . We are advancing IW-3300, a GC-C agonist, for the potential treatment of visceral pain conditions, such as IC/BPS and endometriosis. In September 2024, we decided to end further recruitment for the Phase II proof of concept study in IC/BPS and analyze the data once all currently enrolled patients complete the full 12-week study assessment, which will inform the next steps on the program. Early research and development . Our early research and development efforts have been focused on supporting our development stage GI programs, including exploring strategic options for further development of certain of our internal programs, as well as evaluating external development-stage GI programs.

 (1) Includes linaclotide in all indications, populations and formulation. (2) Includes 11.4 million of share-based compensation expense and 3.5 million of employer payroll tax expense recognized immediately after the closing of the VectivBio Acquisition in the second quarter of 2023 in connection with the vesting acceleration and settlement of outstanding stock options and RSUs. (3) Includes 6.0 million up-front payment recognized in the second quarter of 2023 in connection with the amendment to the COUR Collaboration Agreement. (4) Includes 4.8 million reduction to research and development expense recognized in the first quarter of 2024 in connection with the settlement of a license-related contract liability. The lengthy process of securing regulatory approvals for new drugs, including apraglutide, requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall. We cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on linaclotide for additional indications, populations or formulations. Given the inherent uncertainties that come with the development of pharmaceutical products, we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty how our programs will evolve, and therefore the amount of time or money that would be required to obtain regulatory approval to market them. As a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals, we are currently unable to estimate precisely when, if ever, linaclotide s utility will be expanded within its currently approved indications; if or when linaclotide will be developed outside of its current markets, indications, populations or formulations; or when, if ever, apraglutide or any of our other product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows. We invest carefully in our pipeline, and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development programs is dependent upon the receipt of clear, supportive data. In addition, we intend to access externally discovered drug candidates that fit within our core strategy. In evaluating these potential assets, we apply the same investment criteria as those used for investments in internally discovered assets. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to: The duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate; The U.S. FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial and varying requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures; Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity. Data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval; 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 The duration and cost of early research and development, including nonclinical studies and clinical trials, may vary significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict; The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable, and, even if approved, a product may face post-approval development and regulatory requirements; There may be substantial costs, delays and difficulties in successfully integrating externally developed product candidates into our business operations; and The emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively impact us. As a result of the factors discussed above, including the factors discussed under Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future nonclinical and clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. Development timelines, probability of success and development costs vary widely. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the data of each product candidate, the competitive landscape and ongoing assessments of such product candidate s commercial potential. We expect to invest in our development programs and incur substantial research and development expenses for the foreseeable future. We will continue to invest in linaclotide, including the investigation of ways to enhance the clinical profile within its currently approved indications, and the exploration of its potential utility in other indications, populations and formulations. We will continue to invest in our GI-focused product candidates, including apraglutide, as we advance them through pre-clinical and clinical trials, in addition to funding research and development activities under our external collaboration and license agreements. Acquired In-Process Research and Development. Asset acquisition costs, license fees and development milestone payments related to acquired and in-licensed products and technology are expensed as acquired in-process research and development at the point that they have no established alternative future use. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses for personnel in our administrative, finance, legal, information technology, business development, commercial, sales, marketing, communications and human resource functions. Other costs include legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property, general and administrative related facility costs, insurance costs and professional fees for accounting, tax, consulting, legal and other services. As we continue to invest in the commercialization of LINZESS, apraglutide and other product candidates, we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will be substantial for the foreseeable future. We include AbbVie s selling, general and administrative cost-sharing payments in the calculation of the net profits and net losses from the sale of LINZESS in the U.S. and present the net payment to or from AbbVie as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue, respectively. Restructuring Expenses. Restructuring expenses pertain to restructuring initiatives in connection with the VectivBio Acquisition and are more fully described in Note 12, Workforce Reductions and Restructuring. Interest Expense and Other Financing Costs. Interest expense consists primarily of cash and non-cash interest costs related to our convertible senior notes and Revolving Credit Facility. Non-cash interest expense consists of amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest and Investment Income. Interest and investment income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, as well as significant financing components of payments due from collaboration partners. Gain on Derivatives. Gain on derivatives consists of the change in fair value of note hedge warrants, which terminated unexercised upon expiry in April 2023. Refer to Note 9, Debt , in the financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the note hedge warrants.

 Income Taxes. We prepare our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the income tax accounting rules and each jurisdiction s enacted tax laws and regulations. At interim reporting dates, we record our income tax provision by applying our estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income, plus adjustments for significant unusual or infrequently occurring items. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies as reported in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Interest Expense and Other Financing Costs. Interest expense decreased by 0.4 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease of 0.4 million in coupon interest expenses associated with the 2024 Convertible Notes, which were fully repaid upon maturity in June 2024. Interest expense increased by 10.9 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase of 11.6 million of interest expense incurred under the revolving credit facility used to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition in June 2023. Interest and Investment Income. Interest and investment income decreased by 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from a decrease in cash and investment balances following the VectivBio Acquisition in September 2023. Interest and investment income decreased by 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from a decrease in cash and investment balances following the VectivBio Acquisition in June 2023. Gain on Derivatives. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an insignificant gain on derivatives resulting from a decrease in the fair value of our note hedge warrants, which terminated unexercised upon expiry during April 2023. Income Tax Expense . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 13.7 million and 42.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 18.0 million and 51.4 million, respectively. Due to our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset federal taxable income and taxable income in most states, the majority of our tax provision will be a non-cash expense until our net operating losses have been fully utilized. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had 88.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents include amounts held in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. We invest cash in excess of immediate requirements in accordance with our investment policy, which limits the amounts we may invest in certain types of investments and requires all investments held by us to be at least A- rated, with a remaining final maturity when purchased of less than twenty-four months, so as to primarily achieve liquidity and capital preservation objectives. We anticipate our cash balance and our expected net cash inflows from operations to allow us to meet our near-term and long-term cash obligations, which are reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our most significant fixed obligations are debt obligations and lease commitments, for which annual payments are disclosed in Note 9, Debt , and Note 7, Leases , respectively, to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase all or part of our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such repurchases, redemptions or exchanges, if any, of our debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material. Sources of Liquidity We have financed our operations to date primarily through both the private sale of our preferred stock and the public sale of our common stock, debt financings, and cash generated from our operations. As of September 30, 2024, our debt is comprised of 200.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, due in 2026, and 400.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, which we entered into in May 2023 to partially finance the VectivBio Acquisition. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for 550.0 million of borrowing capacity and includes a 10.0 million letter of credit subfacility. Refer to Note 9, Debt , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information related to our debt obligations.

 Summary of Cash Flows The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 9,885 32,459 88,335 147,593 Investing activities (16) (22,625) (142) (1,022,130) Financing activities (27,156) (74,988) (92,083) 328,064 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (26) (3) (53) (3) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (17,313) (65,157) (3,943) (546,476) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities is derived by adjusting net income (loss) for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in the results of operations. Net cash inflows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 9.9 million and 88.3 million, respectively, and were derived primarily from collaboration arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S. Net cash inflows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 32.5 million and 147.6 million, respectively, and were primarily from collaboration arrangements revenue related to sales of LINZESS in the U.S. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was insignificant and pertained to the purchase of property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 22.6 million and approximately 1.0 billion, respectively, and pertained primarily to the VectivBio Acquisition. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 27.2 million and 92.1 million, respectively. Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised primarily of a 25.0 million repayment on the Revolving Credit Facility. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised primarily of the repayment of 200.0 million aggregate principal on the 2024 Convertible Notes upon their maturity in June 2024, partially offset by 100.0 million of net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and 10.8 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 75.0 million and related primarily to the repayment of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 328.1 million and was generated primarily from the incurrence of 400.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of 75.0 million of principal repayments.

 Funding Requirements We began commercializing LINZESS in the U.S. with our collaboration partner, AbbVie, in the fourth quarter of 2012, and we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from this collaboration. Our goal is to generate and maintain positive cash flows, driven by increased revenue generated through sales of LINZESS and other commercial activities and financial discipline, while continuing to invest in the development and commercialization of linaclotide, apraglutide, and other product candidates. Under our collaboration with AbbVie for North America, total net sales of LINZESS in the U.S., as recorded by AbbVie, are reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party, and the resulting amount is shared equally between us and AbbVie. Additionally, we receive royalties from AbbVie based on sales of linaclotide in its licensed territories outside of the U.S. We believe revenues from our LINZESS partnership for the U.S. with AbbVie will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future and we cannot be certain that such revenues, as well as the revenues from our other commercial activities, will continue to enable us to generate positive cash flows, or to do so in the timeframes we expect. We also anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial expenses for the next several years as we further develop and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., develop and commercialize other products, including apraglutide, and invest in building our pipeline through internal or external opportunities. We believe that our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our projected operating needs at least through the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations, including the underlying revenue expectations and estimates regarding the costs to continue to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S., as well as our expectations regarding revenue from Astellas for Japan and AstraZeneca for China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and our goal to generate and maintain positive cash flows, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could vary materially and negatively from these and other forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed under the headings Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate precisely the amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize linaclotide, apraglutide and our other product candidates, in each case, for all of the markets, indications, populations and formulations for which we believe each is suited. Our funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the revenue generated by sales of LINZESS and CONSTELLA and from any other sources; the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization activities, including the expense we incur in marketing and selling LINZESS in the U.S. and from any other sources; the success of our third-party manufacturing activities; the time and costs involved in developing, and obtaining regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, including apraglutide, as well as the timing and cost of any post-approval development and regulatory requirements; the time and cost associated with integrating VectivBio s business and assets into our business operations; the time and costs associated with commercial manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution of apraglutide, if approved; the success of our research and development efforts; the emergence of competing or complementary products;

Table of Contents 
 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish, including milestones, royalties or other payments due or payable under such agreements; the settlement method used for our outstanding convertible notes; and the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies and the impact of other strategic transactions, as well as the cost and timing of evaluating, acquiring, and, if completed, integrating into our business operations any such assets. Financing Strategy We may, from time to time, consider additional funding through a combination of new collaborative arrangements, strategic alliances, and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources. We will continue to manage our capital structure and to consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. Any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past. There can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will also be available on acceptable terms, if at all. New Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We did not otherwise adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that had a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, principally securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, including collateralized reverse repurchase agreements, and money market instruments, as well as commercial paper. The goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term marketable securities. Due to the primarily short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 1 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. Accordingly, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio. We do not believe our cash and cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our cash and cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Given the potential instability of financial institutions, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits. Our convertible senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates; however, because these interest rates are fixed, we may be paying a higher interest rate, relative to market, in the future if our credit rating improves or other circumstances change. 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates relating to our secured 550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The increase or decrease in annual interest expense resulting from a 10 increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate is 3.2 million. Equity Price Risk Our convertible senior notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our Class A Common Stock at conversion or maturity of the notes. The amount of cash we may be required to pay is determined by the price of our Class A Common Stock. The fair value of our convertible senior notes is dependent on the price and volatility of our Class A Common Stock and will generally increase or decrease as the market price of our common stock changes. To minimize the impact of potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the notes, we entered into the capped call transactions with respect to the 1.50 convertible senior notes due 2026. The convertible notes and derivatives are more fully described in Note 9, Debt, in the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Foreign Currency Risk We are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our foreign operations. The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries respective functional currencies. We are also exposed to unfavorable fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. Foreign currency has not had, nor do we believe that a decrease or increase in any foreign currency exchange rates would have, a material impact on our results of operations. Item 4. Controls and Procedure s Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date are effective at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to determine 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the third quarter of 2024, we implemented a new global enterprise resource planning ERP system. The implementation of the system will continue through early 2025. The ERP replaces the existing financial systems we have historically relied on. Throughout the implementation, we are reassessing our processes and procedures, which may result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. Based on management s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that no changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. On June 29, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VectivBio and in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we excluded VectivBio from our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. This exclusion was in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s guidance that a recently acquired business may be omitted from the assessment scope for up to one year form the date of acquisition. We have extended our oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting, as well as our disclosure controls and procedures, to the acquired operations of VectivBio, and we will incorporate VectivBio into our annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.
