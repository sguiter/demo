Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of Finance of America Companies Inc. s (the Company control. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to our expectations regarding the performance of our business, our financial results, our liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as outlook, believes, expects, potential, continues, may, will, should, could, seeks, projects, predicts, intends, plans, estimates, budgets, forecasts, anticipates, or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements, including those risks described below. Given the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which are current only as of the date of this report. Results for any specified quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any future period. The Company does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the Company or other matters and attributable to the Company or any person acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. A number of important factors exist that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. In addition to the other information in the Form 10-Q, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company and our business: 
 our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by operating as a modern retirement solutions platform rather than a vertically integrated lending and complementary services platform due to the transformation of our business; 
 our ability to successfully operate the recently integrated lending platform that we acquired from American Advisors Group in March 2023 and generally, our ability to operate our business profitably; 
 our ability to respond to significant changes in prevailing interest rates and to resume profitable business operations; 
 our geographic market concentration if the economic conditions in our current markets should decline or if our current markets are impacted by natural disasters; 
 our use of estimates in measuring or determining the fair value of the majority of our financial assets and liabilities, which may require us to write down the value of these assets or write up the value of these liabilities if the estimates prove to be incorrect; 
 our ability to prevent cyber intrusions and mitigate cyber risks; 
 the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors in our business markets and worldwide financial markets, including a sustained period of higher interest rates; 
 our ability to manage changes in our licensing status, business relationships, or servicing guidelines with the Government National Mortgage Association Ginnie Mae ), the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD ), or other governmental entities; 
 our ability to obtain sufficient capital and liquidity to meet the financing and operational requirements of our business and our ability to comply with our debt agreements, including warehouse lending facilities, and pay down our substantial debt; 
 our ability to refinance our debt on reasonable terms as it becomes due; 
 our ability to manage disruptions in the secondary home loan market, including the mortgage-backed securities market; 
 our ability to finance and recover costs of our reverse mortgage servicing operations; 
 our ability to maintain compliance with the extensive regulations we are subject to, including consumer protection laws applicable to reverse mortgage lenders, which may be highly complex; 
 4 

our ability to compete with national banks, which are not subject to state licensing and operational requirements; 
 our ability to manage various legal proceedings, federal or state governmental examinations, and enforcement investigations we are subject to from time to time, the results of which are difficult to predict or estimate; 
 our continued ability to remain in compliance with the terms of the consent orders issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of operational assets from American Advisors Group; 
 our holding company status and dependency on distributions from Finance of America Equity Capital LLC; 
 our ability to comply with the continued listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and avoid the delisting of our common stock from trading on its exchange; 
 our common stock trading history has been characterized by low trading volume, which may result in an inability to sell your shares at a desired price, if at all; and 
 our controlled company status under NYSE rules, which exempts us from certain corporate governance requirements and affords stockholders fewer protections. 
 All of these factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results, and may be beyond our control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all such factors or to assess the effect of each such new factor on our business. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and any of these statements included herein may prove to be inaccurate. Given the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements, or our objectives and plans will be achieved. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in this report, and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 15, 2024, for further information on these and other risk factors affecting us, as such factors may be amended and updated from time to time in the Company s subsequent periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov.

 The Company determined that the AAG Transaction should be considered an asset acquisition, because substantially all of the fair value of the acquired assets was concentrated in a single group of similar assets. Under the accounting for asset acquisitions, the acquisition is recorded using a cost accumulation and allocation model under which the cost of the acquisition is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related transaction costs are capitalized as a component of the cost of the assets acquired. Consequently, no goodwill was recognized as part of this transaction.

 The Company securitized certain of its interests in non-agency reverse mortgage loans and in agency-eligible residential mortgage loans. The transactions provided investors with the ability to invest in a pool of mortgage loans secured by residential properties and provided the Company with access to liquidity for these assets and ongoing service fees. The Company s beneficial interest in the securitizations is limited to a eligible vertical interest in the trusts. The Company determined that the securitization structures meet the definition of a VIE and concluded that the Company does not hold a significant variable interest in the securitizations and that the contractual role as servicer is not a variable interest. The transfers of the loans to the VIEs were determined to be sales. The Company derecognized the mortgage loans and did not consolidate the trusts. 
 The Company s continuing involvement with and exposure to loss from the VIEs includes the carrying value of the retained bonds, the servicing asset recognized in the sale of the loans, servicing advances in the role as servicer, and obligations under representations and warranties contained in the loan sale agreements. Creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to the Company s assets or general credit. The underlying performance of the mortgage loans transferred has a direct impact on the fair values and cash flows of the beneficial interests held and the servicing asset recognized.

eligible vertical interest in the trusts. The Company determined that these securitization structures meet the definition of a VIE and concluded that the Company does not hold a significant variable interest in the securitizations and the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIEs. However, the transfers of the loans to the VIEs were determined not to be sales. As such, the Company continues to recognize the loans and recognized a nonrecourse liability for the proceeds received from third parties for the transfer of the loans. Bonds issued in the securitization that were retained by the Company are not recognized. The Company s continuing involvement with and exposure to loss from the VIEs includes the carrying value of the retained bonds, servicing advances in the role as servicer, and obligations under representations and warranties contained in the loan sale agreements. Creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to the Company s assets or general credit. The underlying performance of the mortgage loans held has a direct impact on the fair values and cash flows of the beneficial interests held.

representative lawsuits alleging violations of the California Labor Code and brought pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act PAGA ). The cases have been coordinated. On November 4, 2022, the court ordered that each of the plaintiffs individual PAGA claims must be arbitrated and that their representative PAGA claims will be stayed pending a ruling by the California Supreme Court in the third-party case Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc . On July 17, 2023, the California Supreme Court issued its decision in Adolph , ruling that an order compelling arbitration of individual claims does not strip the plaintiff of standing to litigate the representative portion of the PAGA claim. The Company has settled of the individual arbitration claims for a de minimis amount and is in different stages of the remaining individual arbitration claim and the representative PAGA claims. Generally, the representative PAGA claims remain stayed until the individual claims are resolved. Due to the unpredictable nature of litigation generally, and the wide discretion afforded the Court in awarding civil penalties in PAGA actions, the outcome of these matters cannot be presently determined, and a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated. Although the actions are being vigorously defended, the Company could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a negative effect on its results of operations in any particular period.

 The Company also has commitments to purchase loans totaling million as of September 30, 2024, compared to million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Mandatory Repurchase Obligation 
 The Company is required to repurchase reverse loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once the outstanding principal balance of the related HECM is equal to or greater than of the MCA. Performing repurchased loans are typically conveyed to HUD and nonperforming repurchased loans are generally liquidated in accordance with program requirements. Loans are considered nonperforming upon events including, but not limited to, the death of the mortgagor, the mortgagor no longer occupying the property as their principal residence, or the property taxes or insurance are not being paid. 
 As an issuer of HMBS, the Company also has the option to repurchase reverse loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools without prior approval from Ginnie Mae in certain instances. These situations include the borrower requesting an additional advance that causes the outstanding principal balance to be equal to or greater than of the MCA; the borrower s loan becoming due and payable under certain circumstances; the borrower not occupying the home for greater than twelve consecutive months for physical or mental illness, and the home is not the residence of another borrower; or the borrower failing to perform in accordance with the terms of the loan. 
 For each HECM loan that the Company securitizes into agency HMBS, the Company is required to covenant and warrant to Ginnie Mae, among other things, that the HECM loans related to each participation included in the agency HMBS are eligible under the requirements of the National Housing Act and the Ginnie Mae MBS Guide, and that the Company will take all actions necessary to ensure the HECM loan s continued eligibility.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effect of the elimination of the noncontrolling interest due to the assumed exchange of all Class A LLC Units outstanding for shares of Class A Common Stock in FoA was determined to be anti-dilutive under the if-converted method. As such, the effect has been excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share. 
 
 Following the terms of the A R LLC Agreement, the Class A LLC unitholders bear approximately of the cost of any vesting associated with the Replacement RSUs and Earnout Right RSUs prior to any distribution by the Company to such Class A LLC unitholders. The remaining compensation cost associated with the Replacement RSUs and Earnout Right RSUs was borne by FoA. As a result of the application of the if-converted method in arriving at diluted earnings (loss) per share, the entirety of the compensation cost associated with vesting of the Replacement RSUs and Earnout Right RSUs is assumed to be included in the net income (loss) attributable to holders of the Company s Class A Common Stock. As of April 1, 2024, there is no further compensation cost associated with the Replacement RSUs and Earnout Right RSUs. 
 
 (2) The Exchange Agreement allows for the exchange of Class A LLC Units held by Equity Capital Unitholders, representing the noncontrolling interest, on a -for-one basis for shares of Class A Common Stock in FoA.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. Except where the context otherwise requires, the terms Finance of America, FoA, the Company, we, us, or our refer to the business of Finance of America Companies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to FoA Equity are to Finance of America Equity Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, that the Company controls in an UP-C structure. 

Overview 
 Finance of America Companies Inc. is a financial services holding company which, through its operating subsidiaries, is a leading provider of home equity-based financing solutions for a modern retirement. In addition, FoA offers capital markets and portfolio management capabilities primarily to optimize the distribution of its originated loans to investors. 
 FoA was incorporated in Delaware on October 9, 2020 and became a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2021, with trading beginning on April 5, 2021 under the ticker symbol FOA. FoA has a controlling financial interest in FoA Equity. FoA Equity owns all of the outstanding equity interests in Finance of America Funding LLC FOAF ). FOAF wholly owns Finance of America Holdings LLC FAH and Incenter LLC Incenter and collectively, with FoA Equity, FOAF, and FAH, known as holding company subsidiaries ). FAH is the parent of a lending company, Finance of America Reverse LLC FAR ), while Incenter is the parent of operating service companies (together with FAR, the operating subsidiaries that provide capital markets and portfolio management capabilities. 
 Through the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2022, the Company was principally focused on offering (1) a wide array of loan products throughout the United States U.S. ), including reverse mortgage loans, traditional mortgage loans, business purpose loans to residential real estate investors, and home improvement loans, and (2) complementary lender services such as title insurance and settlement services to mortgage businesses. However, during the fourth quarter of 2022 and calendar year 2023, the Company exited multiple business lines, including its traditional mortgage lending segment, its commercial lending segment, its home improvement lending business, and its lender services businesses, and shifted its focus to developing a streamlined retirement solutions business. 
 Our strategy and long-term growth initiatives are built upon a few key fundamental factors: 
 We are focused on growing our core retirement solutions business, which benefits from a shared set of demographic and economic tailwinds. We believe we can more effectively dispatch our innovative suite of solutions to help senior homeowners achieve their retirement goals through the use of home equity. 
 We seamlessly connect borrowers with investors. Our consumer-facing business leaders interface directly with the investor-facing professionals in our Portfolio Management segment, facilitating the development of attractive lending solutions for our customers with the confidence that the loans we generate can be efficiently and profitably sold to a deep pool of investors, either directly via whole-loan sales or indirectly via the issuance and sale of mortgage-backed securities. We seek to programmatically and profitably monetize our loans, which minimizes capital at risk, while often retaining a future performance-based participation interest in the underlying cash flows of our monetized loans. 
 We distribute our products through multiple channels, including through newer channels as a result of the asset acquisition from American Advisors Group, now known as Bloom Retirement Holdings Inc. AAG/Bloom ), that closed on March 31, 2023, and utilize flexible technology platforms in order to scale our businesses and manage costs efficiently. 
 Through FAR, the Company originates, acquires, and services home equity conversion mortgages HECM ), which are originated pursuant to the Federal Housing Administration (the FHA HECM program and are insured by the FHA, and non-agency reverse mortgage loans, which are not insured by the FHA. We originate loans through a retail channel (consisting primarily of a centralized retail platform) and a third-party originator TPO channel (consisting primarily of a network of mortgage brokers). We have launched several non-agency reverse mortgage loan products to serve the U.S. senior population and have plans for additional innovative products to satisfy this vast and largely underserved market. We also service the loans that we originate, contracting with various third-party subservicers for the subservicing of our loans. We are a leader in this market and we are focused on 
 57 

developing and offering products for borrowers with interest in using the reverse mortgage loan product as a retirement planning tool. 
 Our Portfolio Management segment provides structuring and product development expertise as well as broker/dealer and institutional asset management capabilities, which facilitates innovation and the successful monetization of our loans. We securitize HECM into Home Equity Conversion Mortgage-Backed Securities HMBS ), which the Government National Mortgage Association Ginnie Mae guarantees, and sell the HMBS in the secondary market while retaining the rights to service the HECM. When HECM are not eligible for securitization into HMBS or are required to be bought out of a pool of HECM previously securitized into an HMBS, we securitize them into privately placed mortgage-backed securities or hold them for investment. We both securitize non-agency reverse mortgage loans into mortgage-backed securities sold to investors and sell them as whole loans to investors. We may also decide to strategically hold certain non-agency reverse mortgage loans for investment. The capabilities provided by the Portfolio Management segment allowed us to complete several issuances and sales of mortgage-backed securities backed by our loan products in 2023 and through three quarters of 2024, demonstrating the high quality and liquidity of the loan products we originate, the deep relationships we have with our investors, and the resilience of our business model in many economic environments. 
 See Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent actions affecting the overall go-forward business operations, including details regarding the series of transactions entered into in order to transform our business from a vertically integrated lending and complementary services platform to a modern retirement solutions platform. 

Our Segments 
 In connection with the transformation of our business from a vertically integrated lending and complementary services platform to a modern retirement solutions platform, we realigned our business to operate through two reportable segments: Retirement Solutions and Portfolio Management. See Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the realignment of our reportable segments. 
 Retirement Solutions 
 The mission of our Retirement Solutions segment is to help senior homeowners achieve their financial goals in retirement. This segment includes all loan origination activity for the Company, including the origination of HECM and non-agency reverse mortgage loans through both the retail and TPO channels. The Retirement Solutions segment generates revenue from fees earned at the time of loan origination as well as from the initial estimate of net origination gains, with all originated loans accounted for at fair value. Once originated, the loans are transferred to our Portfolio Management segment, and any future fair value adjustments, including interest earned, on these originated loans are reflected in the revenues of our Portfolio Management segment until final disposition. 
 Finance of America Mortgage LLC FAM ), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, has sold the operational assets of its home improvement lending business and substantially completed the process of winding down the operations of the home improvement lending business as of March 31, 2024. However, the previous operations of the home improvement lending business are reported as part of the Company s Retirement Solutions segment rather than as discontinued operations. This is because the wind-down of the home improvement lending business was not considered by the Company to be a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. 
 Portfolio Management 
 Our Portfolio Management segment provides product development, loan securitization, loan sales, risk management, servicing oversight, and asset management services to the Company. Our Portfolio Management team acts as the connector between borrowers and investors. The direct connections to investors, provided by our Financial Industry Regulatory Authority registered broker-dealer, allows us to innovate and manage risk through better price and product discovery. Given our scale, we are able to work directly with investors and, where appropriate, retain assets on the balance sheet for attractive return opportunities. These retained investments are a source of growing and recurring interest and other servicing-related income. The Portfolio Management segment primarily generates 
 58 

revenue from the net interest income and fair value changes on portfolio assets, monetized through securitization, sale, or other financing of those assets. 
 See the Segment Results section below and Note 17 - Business Segment Reporting in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional financial information about our segments. 

Business Trends and Conditions 
 There are several key factors and trends affecting our results of operations. A summary of key factors impacting our revenues include: 
 prevailing interest rates which impact loan origination volume, with declining interest rates leading to increases in volume, and an increasing interest rate environment leading to decreases in volume; 
 our ability to successfully operate the newly integrated lending platform that we acquired from AAG/Bloom in March 2023; 
 housing market trends which also impact loan origination volume, with a strong housing market leading to higher loan origination volume, and a weak housing market leading to lower loan origination volume; 
 demographic and housing stock trends which impact the addressable market size; 
 movement of market interest rates and yields required by investors, with the increasing of market interest rates and yields generally having negative impacts on the fair value of our financial assets, and the decreasing of market interest rates and yields generally having positive impacts on the fair value of our financial assets; 
 increases or decreases in default status of loans and prepayment speeds; and 
 broad economic factors such as the strength and stability of the overall economy, including sustained higher or lower interest rates and inflation, the unemployment level, and real estate values. 
 Other factors that may affect our cost base include trends in salaries and benefits costs, sales commissions, technology, rent, legal, compliance, and other general and administrative costs. Management continually monitors these costs through operating plans. 

Other Recent Events 
 Due to significant inflationary pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate during the first three quarters of 2023 and during the same period, reduced its overall purchases and holdings of government and mortgage-related bonds. Higher interest rates generally led to lower mortgage transaction volumes, increased competition, and lower profit margins. Volatility in market conditions resulting from the foregoing events have caused and may continue to cause credit spreads to widen, which reduces, among other things, availability of credit to our Company on favorable terms, liquidity in the market, the fair market value of the assets on our balance sheet, and price transparency of real estate related or asset-backed assets. More recently, inflationary pressures have eased and, based on weakening inflation pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024 and 25 basis points in November 2024. 
 Our Company is actively monitoring these events and their effects on the Company s financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry, and workforce. 
 These continuing economic impacts may cause additional volatility in the financial markets and may have an adverse effect on the Company s results of future operations, financial position, intangible assets, and liquidity in 2024 and beyond. See Results of Operations. 
 For further discussion on the potential impacts of the Federal Reserve s monetary policies, see Risks Related to the Business of the Company and Our business is significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. Changes in prevailing interest rates due to U.S. monetary policies or other macroeconomic conditions that affect interest rates may have a detrimental effect on our operations, financial performance, and earnings under the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 15, 2024, as such risk factors may be amended or updated in our subsequent periodic reports filed with the SEC.

Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations 
 As a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors that may impact the comparability of our results of operations. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 During the fourth quarter of 2022 and calendar year 2023, the Company entered into a series of transactions, discontinuing certain business lines while enhancing our reverse mortgage loan business, in order to transform our business from a vertically integrated lending and complementary services platform to a modern retirement solutions platform. This transformation included the wind-down of the previously reported Mortgage Originations segment, other than the home improvement lending business, and sale of the previously reported Commercial Originations and Lender Services segments, with the exception of its Incenter Solutions LLC operating service subsidiary. This constitutes a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, starting with the first fiscal quarter of 2023, results of our previously reported Mortgage Originations, Commercial Originations, and Lender Services segments, excluding the home improvement lending business and Incenter Solutions LLC, are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 205, Presentation of Financial Statements . During the third fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company sold the operational assets of the home improvement lending business and began the process of winding down the operations of the home improvement lending business, which was substantially complete as of March 31, 2024 . Also during the third fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company ceased the operations of Incenter Solutions LLC. The wind-down of Incenter Solutions LLC was substantially complete by the end of December 2023. The Company s wind-down of the home improvement lending business and Incenter Solutions LLC was not considered by the Company to be a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the previous operations of the home improvement lending business and Incenter Solutions LLC are not reported as discontinued operations. Refer to Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business and Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 AAG Transaction 
 On March 31, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets, including the retail loan originations platform, and liabilities associated with the AAG Transaction. Refer to Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business and Note 3 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 On July 25, 2024, the Company completed a 1-for-10 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of its shares of Class A Common Stock. FoA Equity completed a corresponding 1-for-10 reverse split of its units Class A LLC Units to maintain the 1-for-1 parity of its Class A LLC Units with the Company s adjusted number of Class A Common Stock shares. All references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to numbers of Class A Common Stock shares, weighted average shares outstanding, earnings (loss) per share, FoA Class A Common Stock share price, and number of Class A LLC Units have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, an immaterial amount was reclassified from Class A Common Stock to additional paid-in capital in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 Change in Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations Presentation 
 Beginning with the Company s second quarter 2024 Form 10-Q, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations presentation was changed to provide additional detail regarding the Company s activities. The change primarily consists of disaggregating the Company s previously reported net fair value gains (losses) on loans and related obligations caption into the currently presented captions of interest income, interest expense, net origination gains, gain on securitization of HECM tails, net, fair value changes from model amortization, and fair value changes from market inputs or model assumptions. Additionally, previously reported interest income and interest expense, which primarily represented the Company s interest income on mortgage loans held for sale and other interest income and the Company s interest expense associated with the Company s other financing lines of credit, was combined with the interest income and interest expense that was previously reported within net fair value gains (losses) on loans and related obligations, excluding non-portfolio interest income and the interest expense associated with the Company s non-funding debt, which is now reported separately as non-funding interest expense, net. As a result of the change, the Company s previously reported revenues have been recast to reflect the updated 
 60 

presentation. Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes improved 380.7 million primarily as a result of the following: 
 Net portfolio interest income decreased 8.5 million primarily due to higher average cost of funds within our securitized financing portfolio more than offsetting the increase in interest income on the underlying loans. 
 Net fair value changes on loans and related obligations improved 369.0 million primarily as a result of improved fair value changes from market inputs or model assumptions compared to the 2023 period. The improvement in fair value changes from market inputs or model assumptions was primarily related to market interest rate and yield volatility, which generated net fair value gains during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to losses in the 2023 period. See Note 6 - Fair Value within the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on assumptions impacting the value of our loans held for investment. 
 The Retirement Solutions segment recognized 57.2 million in net origination gains on loan originations of 513.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 31.4 million in net origination gains on loan originations of 470.0 million for the comparable 2023 period. The increase in net origination gains in the Retirement Solutions segment was due to both higher loan origination volumes and higher margins. 
 The 3.5 million increase in gain on securitization of HECM tails, net, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was due to higher premiums from our tail securitizations. Fair value changes from model amortization improved 13.1 million as a function of lower net realized portfolio income and expenses and higher modeled yield on a larger portfolio in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period. 
 Fee income decreased 5.1 million primarily due to fees associated with the previous operations of the home improvement lending business. 
 Gain (loss) on sale and other income from loans held for sale, net, improved 7.0 million due to the absence of residential, commercial, and home improvement loans held for sale activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 64 

Non-funding interest expense, net, increased 1.9 million due to increases in outstanding amounts and interest rates on our working capital promissory notes. 
 Total expenses decreased 25.1 million or 23.8 primarily due to decreases in salaries, benefits, and related expenses as well as decreases in general and administrative expenses due to a reduction in average headcount and continued cost-cutting measures associated with the restructuring of the business. 
 Other, net, changed 5.4 million primarily due to the ongoing remeasurement of our deferred purchase price liabilities. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes improved 527.0 million primarily as a result of the following: 
 Net fair value changes on loans and related obligations improved 477.9 million primarily as a result of improved fair value changes from market inputs or model assumptions compared to the 2023 period. The improvement in fair value changes from market inputs or model assumptions was primarily related to market interest rate and yield volatility, which generated net fair value gains during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to losses during the 2023 period. See Note 6 - Fair Value within the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on assumptions impacting the value of our loans held for investment. 
 The Retirement Solutions segment recognized 137.1 million in net origination gains on loan originations of 1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 88.8 million in net origination gains on loan originations of 1.2 billion for the comparable 2023 period. The increase in net origination gains in the Retirement Solutions segment was due to both higher loan origination volumes and higher margins associated with the increase in volumes from our retail platform acquired from AAG/Bloom. 
 The 15.2 million increase in gain on securitization of HECM tails, net, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was due to higher premiums from our tail securitizations. Fair value changes from model amortization improved 13.2 million as a function of lower net realized portfolio income and expenses and higher modeled yield on a larger portfolio in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period. 
 Fee income decreased 11.2 million primarily related to lower mortgage servicing rights MSR servicing fee income due to a much lower MSR portfolio balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period, as well as lower fees associated with the previous operations of the home improvement lending business, and a decline in services provided by the Company s operational fulfillment services team. These reductions were partially offset by higher reverse loan origination fees generated through our retail platform acquired from AAG/Bloom. 
 Gain (loss) on sale and other income from loans held for sale, net, improved 23.8 million as a result of minimal residential, commercial, and home improvement loans held for sale activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period. 
 Non-funding interest expense, net, increased 4.7 million due to increases in outstanding amounts and interest rates on our working capital promissory notes. 
 Total expenses decreased 42.5 million or 14.2 primarily due to decreases in salaries, benefits, and related expenses as well as decreases in general and administrative expenses due to a reduction in average headcount and continued cost-cutting measures associated with the restructuring of the business. This was partially offset by an increase in marketing and advertising expenses within our retail loan originations platform acquired from AAG/Bloom. 

SEGMENT RESULTS 
 Revenues and fees are directly attributed to their respective segments at the time services are performed. Revenues generated on inter-segment services performed are valued based on estimated market value. Expenses directly attributable to the operating segments are expensed as incurred. Other expenses are allocated to individual segments based on the estimated value of services performed, total revenue contributions, personnel headcount, or the equity invested in each segment based on the type of expense allocated. The allocation methodology is reviewed annually. There were no changes to methodology during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Our Retirement Solutions segment generates its revenues primarily from the origination of reverse mortgage loans, including HECM insured by the FHA and non-agency reverse mortgage loans. Revenues from our Retirement Solutions segment include both our initial estimate of net origination gains from originated loans, which is determined by utilizing quoted prices on similar securities or internally-developed models utilizing observable market inputs, in addition to fees earned at the time of origination of the associated loans. We elect to account for all originated loans at fair value. The loans are immediately transferred to our Portfolio Management segment, and any future fair value adjustments, including interest earned, on these originated loans are reflected in revenues of our Portfolio Management segment until final disposition. 
 On August 31, 2023, FAM entered into an agreement to sell the operational assets of the home improvement lending business. This transaction closed on September 15, 2023. In connection with such transaction, the Company began the process of winding down the operations of the home improvement lending business, which was substantially complete as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, there were no loans in the home improvement lending pipeline. The wind-down of the home improvement lending business was not considered by the Company to be a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the previous operations of the home improvement lending business are reported as part of the Company s Retirement Solutions segment rather than as discontinued operations.

 Net portfolio interest income decreased 8.5 million primarily due to higher average cost of funds within our securitized financing portfolio more than offsetting the increase in interest income on the underlying loans. 
 Net fair value changes on loans and related obligations improved 343.2 million primarily as a result of improved fair value changes from market inputs or model assumptions compared to the 2023 period. The improvement in fair value changes from market inputs or model assumptions was primarily related to market interest rate and yield volatility, which generated net fair value gains during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to losses during the 2023 period. See Note 6 - Fair Value within the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on assumptions impacting the value of our loans held for investment. 
 The 3.5 million increase in gain on securitization of HECM tails, net, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was due to higher premiums from our tail securitizations. Fair value changes from model amortization improved 13.1 million as a function of lower net realized portfolio income and expenses and higher modeled yield on a larger portfolio in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period. 
 Gain (loss) on sale and other income from loans held for sale, net, improved 4.8 million due to the absence of residential, commercial, and home improvement loans held for sale activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenues decreased 3.2 million primarily as a result of the following: 
 Fee income decreased 1.4 million related to the decline in services provided by the Company s operational fulfillment services team. As of September 30, 2023, the Company ceased the operations of the offshore fulfillment services team. 
 Non-funding interest expense, net, increased 1.9 million due to increases in outstanding amounts and interest rates on our working capital promissory notes. 
 Total expenses decreased 12.0 million or 47.0 as a result of the following: 
 Salaries, benefits, and related expenses, net of shared services allocations, decreased 7.3 million or 48.3 due to decreases in salaries and bonuses and other salary related expenses of 5.0 million and 4.0 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period as the Company continued our focus on cost-cutting initiatives related to the restructuring of the business. Compared to 2023, average onshore headcount declined by 29.0 from 338 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 240 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These reductions were partially offset by a 1.8 million decrease in shared services allocations due to the reduction in supported business lines in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 General and administrative expenses, net of shared services allocations, decreased 4.6 million or 46.0 primarily due to a 5.6 million decrease in communications and data processing and other expenses. These reductions are due to continued cost-cutting measures associated with the restructuring of the business. This was partially offset by a 2.3 million decrease in shared services allocations due to the reduction in supported business lines in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other, net, changed 5.4 million primarily due to the ongoing remeasurement of our deferred purchase price liabilities. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenues decreased 11.1 million primarily as a result of the following: 
 Fee income decreased 6.4 million related to the decline in services provided by the Company s operational fulfillment services team. As of September 30, 2023, the Company ceased the operations of the offshore fulfillment services team. 
 Non-funding interest expense, net, increased 4.7 million due to increases in outstanding amounts and interest rates on our working capital promissory notes. 
 Total expenses decreased 35.2 million or 41.7 as a result of the following: 
 Salaries, benefits, and related expenses, net of shared services allocations, decreased 18.5 million or 37.5 due to decreases in salaries and bonuses and other salary related expenses of 20.6 million and 6.8 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period as the Company continued our focus on cost-cutting initiatives related to the restructuring of the business. Compared to 2023, average onshore headcount declined by 36.8 from 408 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 258 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These reductions were partially offset by a 9.0 million decrease in shared services allocations due to the reduction in supported business lines in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 General and administrative expenses, net of shared services allocations, decreased 16.1 million or 47.6 due to a 19.0 million decrease in communications and data processing and other expenses and a 2.6 million decrease in professional and consulting fees. These reductions are due to continued cost-cutting measures associated with the restructuring of the business. This was partially offset by a 5.5 million decrease in shared services allocations due to the reduction in supported business lines in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 The Company s management evaluates performance of the Company through the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA ), and adjusted earnings (loss) per share. 
 The presentation of non-GAAP measures is used to enhance investors understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance. This discussion is not meant to be considered in isolation, superior to, or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). Management believes these key financial measures provide an additional view of our performance over the long-term and provide useful information that we use in order to maintain and grow our business. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating cash flows, or any other performance measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings (loss) per share have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations of these metrics are: (i) cash expenditures for future contractual commitments; (ii) cash requirements for working capital needs; (iii) cash requirements for certain tax payments; and (iv) all non-cash income/expense items. 
 Because of these limitations, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings (loss) per share should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or distribute to shareholders. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using our non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. Users of our condensed consolidated financial statements are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Change in Non-GAAP Measures 
 Prior to the third quarter of 2024, the Company s adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings (loss) per share were adjusted for equity-based compensation for only the Replacement RSUs and Earnout Right RSUs. Beginning with the third quarter of 2024, the Company revised our definitions of adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings (loss) per share to now adjust for all non-cash equity-based compensation in the aforementioned non-GAAP measures. As a result of the change, prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the updated presentation. 
 Subsequent to granting the Replacement RSUs and Earnout Right RSUs, the Company has granted other equity-based awards. As these awards are non-cash expenses that are not directly correlated with operating results, the Company believes that analysts, investors, and other users of the financial statements may find this change beneficial when analyzing our operating performance and comparability to peers. As a result of the change, adjusted net loss decreased 1.1 million and 2.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, from what was previously reported. The change also resulted in a decrease to adjusted loss per share of 0.05 and 0.13 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, from what was previously reported. 
 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) 
 We define adjusted net income (loss) as consolidated net income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for: 
 1. Income taxes 
 2. Changes in fair value of loans and securities held for investment and related obligations due to market inputs or model assumptions, deferred purchase price obligations (including earnouts and Tax Receivable Agreements TRA obligation), contingent earnout, warrant liability, and minority investments. 
 3. Amortization or impairment of intangibles and impairment of certain other long-lived assets. 
 4. Equity-based compensation, excluding forfeitures and accelerations associated with restructuring activities, which are included in certain non-recurring costs. 
 5. Certain non-recurring costs and adjustments that management believes should be excluded as these do not relate to a recurring part of the core business operations. These items include amounts recognized for settlement of legal and regulatory matters, acquisition or divestiture-related expenses, and other one-time charges. 
 76 

6. Pro-forma income tax benefit (provision) adjustments to apply an effective combined corporate tax rate to adjusted net income (loss) before taxes. 
 Management considers adjusted net income (loss) important in evaluating our Company as a whole. This supplemental metric is utilized by our management team to assess the underlying key drivers and operational performance of the continuing operations of the business. In addition, analysts, investors, and creditors may use this measure when analyzing our operating performance and comparability to peers. Adjusted net income (loss) is not a presentation made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition and use of this measure may vary from other companies in our industry. 
 Adjusted net income (loss) provides visibility to the underlying operating performance by excluding the impact of certain items that management does not believe are representative of our core earnings. Adjusted net income (loss) may also include other adjustments, as applicable, based upon facts and circumstances, consistent with our intent of providing a supplemental means of evaluating our operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for: 
 1. Income taxes 
 2. Change in fair value of loans and securities held for investment and related obligations due to market inputs or model assumptions, deferred purchase price obligations (including earnouts and TRA obligation), contingent earnout, warrant liability, and minority investments. 
 3. Amortization or impairment of intangibles and impairment of certain other long-lived assets. 
 4. Equity-based compensation, excluding forfeitures and accelerations associated with restructuring activities, which are included in certain non-recurring costs. 
 5. Certain non-recurring costs and adjustments that management believes should be excluded as these do not relate to a recurring part of the core business operations. These items include amounts recognized for settlement of legal and regulatory matters, acquisition or divestiture-related expenses, and other one-time charges. 
 6. Depreciation 
 7. Interest expense on non-funding debt 
 We evaluate the performance of our company and segments through the use of adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure. Management considers adjusted EBITDA important in evaluating the Company as a whole. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental metric utilized by our management team to assess the underlying key drivers and operational performance of the continuing operations of the business. In addition, analysts, investors, and creditors may use this measure when analyzing our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our use of this measure and term may vary from other companies in our industry. 
 Adjusted EBITDA provides visibility to the underlying operating performance by excluding the impact of certain items that management does not believe are representative of our core earnings. Adjusted EBITDA may also include other adjustments, as applicable, based upon facts and circumstances, consistent with our intent of providing a supplemental means of evaluating our operating performance. 
 Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
 We define adjusted earnings (loss) per share as adjusted net income (loss) (defined above) divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, which includes outstanding Class A Common Stock plus the Class A LLC Units owned by the noncontrolling interest on an if-converted basis and any shares under the treasury stock method. 
 Analysts, investors, and creditors may use this measure when analyzing our operating performance and comparability to peers. Adjusted earnings (loss) per share is not a presentation made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition and use of this measure may vary from other companies in our industry. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations to adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA (in thousands, except for share data):

 (1) Changes in fair value - The adjustment for changes in fair value includes changes in fair value of loans and securities held for investment and related liabilities due to market inputs or model assumptions, deferred purchase price obligations, contingent earnout, warrant liability, and minority investments. 
 Changes in fair value of loans and securities held for investment and related liabilities due to market inputs or model assumptions - This adjustment relates to changes in the significant market or model input components of the fair value for loans and securities and related obligations, which are held for investment. We include an adjustment for the significant market or model input components of the change in fair value because, while based on real observable and/or predicted changes in drivers of the valuation of assets, they may be mismatched in any given period with the actual change in the underlying economics or when they 
 78 

will be realized in actual cash flows. Changes in fair value of loans and securities held for investment and related obligations include changes in fair value and related hedge gains and losses for the following MSR, loans held for investment, and related liabilities: 
 1. Loans held for investment, subject to HMBS related obligations, at fair value; 
 2. Loans held for investment, subject to nonrecourse debt, at fair value; 
 3. Loans held for investment, at fair value; 
 4. Retained bonds, at fair value; 
 5. MSR, at fair value; 
 6. HMBS related obligations, at fair value; and 
 7. Nonrecourse debt, at fair value. 
 The adjustment for changes in fair value of loans and securities held for investment and related obligations due to market inputs or model assumptions is calculated based on changes in fair value associated with the above assets and liabilities calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding the period-to-date estimated impact of the change in fair value attributable to current period additions and the change in fair value attributable to post-origination loan advances, accretion, and model amortization (i.e., portfolio run-off), net of hedge gains and losses, and any securitization expenses incurred in securitizing our mortgage loans held for investment, subject to nonrecourse debt. This adjustment represents changes in accounting estimates that are measured in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions due to factors such as changes in the economy, interest rates, secondary market pricing, prepayment assumptions, home prices, or discrete events affecting specific borrowers, and such differences could be material. Accordingly, this number should be understood as an estimate and the actual adjustment could vary if our modeling is incorrect. 
 Change in fair value of deferred purchase price obligations - We are obligated to pay contingent consideration to sellers of acquired businesses based on future performance of acquired businesses (earnouts) as well as realization of tax benefits from certain exchanges of Class A LLC Units into Class A Common Stock (TRA obligation). Change in fair value of deferred purchase price obligations represents impacts to revenue or expense due to changes in the estimated fair value of expected payouts as a result of changes in various assumptions, including future performance, timing and realization of tax benefits, and discount rates. 
 Change in fair value of contingent earnout - We are entitled to receive certain contingent consideration from the buyers of our disposed businesses based on future performance of those businesses. Change in fair value of contingent earnout represents impacts to revenue or expense due to changes in the estimated fair value of expected payouts as a result of changes in various assumptions, including future performance and discount rates. 
 Change in fair value of the warrant liability - The adjustment to the warrant liability is based on the change in its measured fair value. Although the change in fair value of the warrant liability is a recurring part of our business, the change in fair value is unrealized, and we believe the adjustment is appropriate as the fair value fluctuations from period to period may make it difficult to analyze core-operating trends. 
 Change in fair value of minority investments - The adjustment to minority equity investments and debt investments is based on the change in their measured fair value. Although the change in fair value of minority equity investments and debt investments is a recurring part of our business, we believe the adjustment is appropriate as the fair value fluctuations from period to period may make it difficult to analyze core-operating trends. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 FoA is a holding company and has no material assets other than its direct and indirect ownership of Class A LLC Units. FoA has no independent means of generating revenue. FoA Equity may make distributions to its holders of Class A LLC Units, including FoA and the Equity Capital Unitholders, in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates, payments under the TRA, and dividends, if any, declared by FoA. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings, or cash flow of FoA Equity and its subsidiaries for any reason 
 79 

could limit or impair FoA Equity s ability to make such distributions. In addition, FoA Equity is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of FoA Equity (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. Subsidiaries of FoA Equity are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to FoA Equity. Further, our existing financing arrangements include, and any financing arrangement that we enter into in the future may include, restrictions that impact FoA Equity s ability to make distributions to FoA. 
 Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability, and overall liquidity are subject to risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to obtain additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. If we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which would result in additional expenses or dilution. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our primary sources of funds for liquidity include: (i) payments received from the sale or securitization of loans; (ii) payments from the liquidation or securitization of our outstanding participating interests in loans; and (iii) advances on warehouse facilities, other secured borrowings, and the 7.875 Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Unsecured Notes ). Refer to Note 21 - Subsequent Events in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the 2025 Unsecured Notes. 
 Our primary uses of funds for liquidity include: (i) funding of borrower advances and draws on outstanding loans; (ii) originations of loans; (iii) payment of operating expenses; and (iv) repayment of borrowings and repurchases or redemptions of outstanding indebtedness. 
 Our cash flow from operating activities when combined with net proceeds from our portfolio financing activities, as well as capacity through existing facilities, provide adequate resources to fund our anticipated ongoing cash requirements . We rely on these facilities to fund operating activities. As the facilities mature, we anticipate renewal of these facilities will be achieved. Future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities, and, if necessary, future access to capital markets. We continue to optimize the use of balance sheet cash to avoid unnecessary interest-carrying costs.

Cash Flows 
 The following table presents amounts from our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (317,610) (10,233) Investing activities 145,598 139,331 Financing activities 167,550 (123,972) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 24 52 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (1) 
 (4,438) 5,178 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (2,224) (31,020) Net increase (decrease) in restricted cash (2,214) 36,198 
 (1) Amounts presented contain results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Refer to Note 4 - Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding cash flow associated with the results of discontinued operations. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an increase of 5.2 million during the comparable period in 2023. Our cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, decreased 2.2 million nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a decrease of 31.0 million during the comparable period in 2023. 
 Operating Cash Flow 
 Cash flows from operating activities decreased by 307.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding 2023 period. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 295.0 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale, net of cash used for originations, which relates to the wind-down of business lines that are not part of our modern retirement solutions platform. 
 Investing Cash Flow 
 The increase of 6.3 million in cash provided by our investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was primarily attributable to a 386.5 million decrease in cash used for purchases and originations of loans held for investment, net of proceeds/payments, and a 140.9 million cash outlay for the AAG Transaction in the 2023 period. This was partially offset by a decrease of 378.0 million in proceeds/payments on loans held for investment, subject to nonrecourse debt, net of cash used for purchases and originations, a decrease of 80.1 million in proceeds from the sale of MSR, and a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of businesses of 68.2 million. 
 Financing Cash Flow 
 The increase of 291.5 million in cash provided by our financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was primarily driven by a 728.6 million increase in proceeds on other financing lines of credit, net of payments. This was partially offset by a 133.6 million decrease in proceeds from issuance of nonrecourse debt, net of payments, and by a 285.4 million increase in payments on HMBS related obligations, net of proceeds. 
 Financial Covenants 
 Our credit facilities contain various financial covenants, which primarily relate to required tangible net worth amounts, liquidity reserves, leverage ratios , and profitability. These covenants are measured at our holding company subsidiary or our operating subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 11 - Other Financing Lines of Credit in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 81 

Compliance Requirements 
 As an issuer of HMBS, FAR is subject to net worth, liquidity, and leverage requirements as established and defined by Ginnie Mae as follows: 
 Minimum Net Worth 
 5.0 million plus 1 of FAR s outstanding HMBS and unused commitment authority from Ginnie Mae. 
 Tangible net worth is defined as total equity less goodwill, intangible assets, affiliate receivables, and certain pledged assets. 
 Minimum Liquidity 
 Maintain liquid assets equal to at least 20 of the minimum net worth required for a HMBS issuer. 
 Minimum Leverage Ratio 
 Maintain a ratio of tangible net worth to total assets greater than 6 . 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FAR was in compliance with the net worth and liquidity requirements. FAR s actual ratio of tangible net worth to total assets was below the Ginnie Mae requirement due to the Company s determination that HECM loans transferred into HMBS securitizations do not meet the requirements of sale accounting. As a result, the Company accounts for HECM loans transferred into HMBS securitizations as secured borrowings and continues to recognize the loans as held for investment, subject to HMBS related obligations, along with the corresponding liability for the HMBS related obligations. FAR received a waiver for the minimum outstanding capital requirements from Ginnie Mae. Therefore, FAR was in compliance with all Ginnie Mae requirements. 
 In connection with the discontinued operations of the Company s previously reported Mortgage Originations segment, FAM has surrendered all its government sponsored entities GSE )/agency mortgage origination licenses and approvals as of June 30, 2024 and is therefore no longer subject to the GSE/agency compliance requirements that were applicable to FAM prior to the surrender of its licenses and approvals. 
 Refer to Note 18 - Liquidity and Capital Requirements in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Summary of Certain Indebtedness 
 The following description is a summary of certain material provisions of our outstanding indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, our debt obligations were 28.3 billion. This summary does not restate the terms of our outstanding indebtedness in its entirety, nor does it describe all of the material terms of our indebtedness. 
 Warehouse Lines of Credit 
 Reverse mortgage facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 995.0 million in warehouse lines of credit capacity collateralized primarily by first lien mortgages with a 576.5 million aggregate principal amount drawn through eight funding facility arrangements with seven active lenders. These facilities are generally structured as master repurchase agreements under which ownership of the related eligible loans is temporarily transferred to a lender, as participation arrangements pursuant to which the lender acquires a participation interest in the related eligible loans, or as loan and security agreements under which eligible loans are pledged to the lender as collateral. The funds advanced to us are generally repaid using the proceeds from the sale or securitization of the loans to, or pursuant to, programs sponsored by Ginnie Mae or private secondary market investors, although prior payment may be required based on, among other things, certain breaches of representations and warranties or other events of default. 
 When we draw on these facilities, we generally must transfer and/or pledge eligible loans to the lender and comply with various financial and other covenants. The facilities generally have one-year terms and expire at various times during 2024 through 2026. Under the facilities, loans are generally transferred and/or pledged at an advance rate less than the principal balance of the loans (the haircut ), which serves as the primary credit enhancement for the lender. Six of our warehouse lines of credit are guaranteed by FAH, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company and the parent holding company to the reverse mortgage business . Since the advances to us are generally for less than 100 of the principal balance of the loans, we are required to use working capital to fund the remaining portion of the principal balance of the loans . Upon expiration, management believes it will either renew its existing facilities or 
 82 

obtain sufficient additional lines of credit. The interest rate on all outstanding facilities is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), plus applicable margin. 
 The following table presents additional information about our warehouse facilities as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Reverse Warehouse Facilities Maturity Date Total Capacity Outstanding Balance Committed June 2025 - September 2025 335,000 321,757 Uncommitted November 2024 (1) - October 2026 
 660,000 254,718 Total reverse warehouse facilities 995,000 576,475 
 (1) The warehouse line of credit with a maturity date in November 2024 has been renewed subsequent to September 30, 2024.

 With respect to each of our warehouse facilities, we pay certain up-front and/or ongoing fees which can be based on our utilization of the facility. In some instances, loans held by a lender for a contractual period exceeding 45 to 60 calendar days after we originate such loans are subject to additional fees and interest rates. 
 Certain of our warehouse facilities contain sub-limits for wet loans, which allow us to finance loans for a minimal period of time prior to delivery of the note collateral to the lender. Wet loans are loans for which the collateral custodian has not yet received the related loan documentation. Dry loans are loans for which all the sale documentation has been completed at the time of funding. Wet loans are held by a lender for a contractual period, typically between five and ten business days and are subject to a reduction in the advance amount. 
 Interest is generally payable at the time the loan is settled off the line or monthly in arrears and the principal is payable upon receipt of loan sale or securitization proce eds or transfer of a loan to another line of credit. The facilities may also require the outstanding principal to be repaid if a loan remains on the line longer than a contractual period of time, which generally ranges from 45 to 365 calendar days. 
 Interest on our warehouse facilities vary by facility and may depend on the type of asset that is being financed. The interest rate on all outstanding facilities is SOFR, plus a spread. 
 Loans financed under certain of our warehouse facilities are subject to changes in fair value and margin calls. The fair value of our loans depends on a variety of economic conditions, including interest rates and market demand for loans. Under certain facilities, if the fair value of the underlying loans declines below the outstanding asset balance on such loans or if the UPB of such loans falls below a threshold related to the repurchase price for such loans, we could be required to (i) repay cash in an amount that cures the margin deficit or (ii) supply additional eligible assets or rights as collateral for the underlying loans to compensate for the margin deficit. Certain warehouse facilities allow for the remittance of cash back to us if the value of the loan exceeds the principal balance. 
 Our warehouse facilities require our borrowing subsidiaries to comply with various customary operating and financial covenants, including, without limitation, the following tests: 
 minimum tangible or adjusted tangible net worth; 
 maximum leverage ratio of total liabilities (which may include off-balance sheet liabilities) or indebtedness to tangible or adjusted tangible net worth; 
 minimum liquidity or minimum liquid assets; and 
 minimum profitability. 
 In the event we fail to comply with the covenants contained in any of our warehouse lines of credit, or otherwise were to default under the terms of such agreements, we may be restricted from paying dividends, reducing or retiring our equity interests, making investments, or incurring more debt. 
 Other Secured Lines of Credit 
 As of September 30, 2024, we collectively had 513.3 million in additional secured facilities with 478.1 million aggregate principal amount drawn through credit agreements or master repurchase agreements with six funding facility arrangements and five active lenders. These facilities are secured by, among other things, eligible asset-backed securities, HECM MSR, and HECM tails. In certain instances, these assets are subject to existing first lien warehouse financing, in which case these facilities (i.e., mezzanine facilities) are secured by the equity in these 
 83 

assets exceeding first lien warehouse financing. These facilities are generally structured as master repurchase agreements under which ownership of the related eligible assets is temporarily transferred to a lender. The funds advanced to us are generally repaid using the proceeds from the sale or securitization of the underlying assets or distribution from underlying securities, although prior payment may be required based on, among other things, certain breaches of representations and warranties or other events of default. 
 When we draw on these facilities, we generally must transfer and pledge eligible assets to the lender and comply with various financial and other covenants. Under our facilities, we generally transfer the assets at a haircut, which serves as the primary credit enhancement for the lender. Four of these facilities are guaranteed by FAH, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 
 The following table presents additional information about our other financing lines of credit as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Other Financing Lines of Credit Maturity Date Total Capacity Outstanding Balance Committed Various (1) 
 473,304 448,609 Uncommitted October 2025 40,000 29,484 Total other secured lines of credit 513,304 478,093 
 (1) These lines of credit are tied to the maturity date of the underlying mortgage related assets or HECM MSR that have been pledged as collateral. 
 We pay certain up-front and ongoing fees based on our utilization with respect to many of these facilities. We pay commitment fees based upon the limit of the facility and unused fees are paid if utilization falls below a certain amount. 
 Interest is payable either at the time the loan or securities are settled off the line or monthly in arrears, and principal is payable upon receipt of asset sale or securitization proceeds, principal distributions on the underlying pledged securities or transfer of assets to another line of credit, and upon the maturity of the facility. 
 Under these facilities, we are generally required to comply with various customary operating and financial covenants. The financial covenants are similar to those under the warehouse lines of credit. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 HMBS Related Obligations 
 FAR is an approved issuer of HMBS securities that are guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and collateralized by participation interests in HECM insured by the FHA. We originate HECM insured by the FHA. Participations in the HECM are pooled into HMBS securities which are sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained. We have determined that loan transfers in the HMBS program do not meet the accounting definition of a participating interest because of the servicing requirements in the product that require the issuer/servicer to absorb some level of interest rate risk, cash flow timing risk, and incidental credit risk due to the buyout of HECM assets as discussed below. As a result, the transfers of the HECM do not qualify for sale accounting, and we, therefore, account for these transfers as financings. Holders of participating interests in the HMBS have no recourse against assets other than the underlying HECM loans, remittances, or collateral on those loans while they are in the securitization pools, except for standard representations and warranties and our contractual obligation to service the HECM and the HMBS. 
 Remittances received on the reverse loans, if any, and proceeds received from the sale of real estate owned, and our funds used to repurchase reverse loans are used to reduce the HMBS related obligations by making payments to the securitization pools, which then remit the payments to the beneficial interest holders of the HMBS. The maturity of the HMBS related obligations is directly affected by the liquidation of the reverse loans or liquidation of real estate owned properties and events of default as stipulated in the reverse loan agreements with borrowers. As an HMBS issuer, FAR assumes certain obligations related to each security it issues. The most significant obligation is the requirement to purchase loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once they reach certain limits set at loan origination for the maximum UPB allowed. Performing repurchased loans are generally conveyed to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and nonperforming repurchased loans are generally liquidated in accordance with program requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had HMBS related obligations of 18.3 billion and HECM pledged as collateral to the pools of 18.5 billion, both carried at fair value. 
 84 

Additionally, as the servicer of reverse mortgage loans, we are obligated to fund additional borrowing capacity primarily in the form of undrawn lines of credit on floating rate reverse mortgage loans. We rely upon certain of our warehouse financing arrangements and our operating cash flows to fund these additional borrowings on a short-term basis prior to securitization. The additional borrowings are generally securitized within 30 days after funding. The obligation to fund these additional borrowings could have a significant impact on our liquidity. 
 Nonrecourse Debt 
 We securitize and issue interests in pools of loans that are not eligible for the Ginnie Mae securitization program. These include reverse mortgage loans that were previously repurchased out of a HMBS pool, which are referred to as HECM buyouts, commercial mortgage loans, and non-agency reverse mortgages. The transactions provide investors with the ability to invest in these pools of assets. The transactions provide us with access to liquidity for these assets, ongoing servicing fees, and potential residual returns for the residual securities we retain at the time of securitization. The transactions are structured as secured borrowings with the loan assets and liabilities, respectively, included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as loans held for investment, subject to nonrecourse debt, at fair value, and nonrecourse debt, at fair value. As of September 30, 2024, we had nonrecourse debt-related borrowings of 8.5 billion. 
 Notes Payable 
 2025 Unsecured Notes 
 On November 5, 2020, FOAF, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, issued 350 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Unsecured Notes. The 2025 Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.875 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 beginning on May 15, 2021. The 2025 Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by FoA and each of FoA s material existing and future consolidated domestic subsidiaries, excluding FOAF and subsidiaries. 
 In accordance with the agreement, FOAF may redeem some or all of the 2025 Unsecured Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof, plus the applicable premium as of the redemption date under the terms of the indenture and accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption price during the twelve-month period following November 15, 2023 and at any time after November 15, 2024 is 101.969 and 100 , respectively, of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the holders of the 2025 Unsecured Notes will have the right to require FOAF to make an offer to repurchase each holder s 2025 Unsecured Notes at a price equal to 101 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
 The 2025 Unsecured Notes contain covenants limiting, among other things, FOAF and its restricted subsidiaries ability to incur certain types of additional debt or issue certain preferred shares, incur liens, make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and merge or consolidate or sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of FOAF s assets. These incurrence-based covenants are subject to exceptions and qualifications. Many of these covenants will cease to apply during any time that the 2025 Unsecured Notes have investment grade ratings and no default with respect to the 2025 Unsecured Notes has occurred and is continuing. The Company was in compliance with all required covenants related to the 2025 Unsecured Notes as of September 30, 2024. 
 FoA s existing owners or their affiliated entities, including Blackstone and Brian L. Libman, FoA s founder and chairman, purchased notes in the offering in an aggregate principal amount of 135.0 million. 
 In October 2024, certain of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company entered into an exchange of the 2025 Unsecured Notes with certain holders. Refer to Note 21 - Subsequent Events in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Related-party notes 
 The Company had two Revolving Working Capital Promissory Note Agreements (the Working Capital Promissory Notes outstanding with BTO Urban Holdings L.L.C. and Libman Family Holdings, LLC, which are deemed affiliates of the Company. Amounts under the Working Capital Promissory Notes may be re-borrowed and repaid from time to time until the relate d maturity date. The Working Capital Promissory Notes accrue interest monthly at a rate of 15.0 per annum and mature in May 2025.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 The following table provides a summary of obligations and commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

 (1) The 350 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Unsecured Notes due November 15, 2025 were exchanged subsequent to the balance sheet date. Refer to Note 21 - Subsequent Events in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 In addition to the above contractual obligations, we have also been involved with several securitizations of HECM loans, which were structured as secured borrowings. These structures resulted in us carrying the securitized loans in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and recognizing the asset-backed certificates acquired by third parties as HMBS related obligations. The timing of the principal payments on this nonrecourse debt is dependent on the payments received on the underlying mortgage loans and liquidation of real estate owned properties. The outstanding principal balance of loans held for investment, subject to HMBS related obligations, was 17.5 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s TRA obligation will require payments to be made that may be significant and are not reflected in the contractual obligations tables set forth above. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 For a description of our critical accounting estimates, see the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our principal market risk is interest rate risk, primarily to changes in long-term Treasury rates and mortgage interest rates due to their impact on mortgage-related assets. Changes in short-term interest rates will also have an impact on our financing lines of credit. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Changes in interest rates will, in general, impact our operating segments as follows: 
 Retirement Solutions 
 an increase in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our loan origination volume as new loans or refinancing an existing loan will be less attractive to borrowers. 
 Portfolio Management 
 an increase in interest rates could generate an increase in delinquency, default, and foreclosure rates resulting in an increase in both servicing costs and interest expense on our outstanding debt. 
 an increase in interest rates will lead to a higher cost of funds on our financing lines of credit. 
 an increase in interest rates and market spreads may cause a reduction in the fair value of our long-term assets. 
 a decrease in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds of our long-term assets which could lead to a reduction in the fair value of our long-term assets. 
 86 

Earnings on our held for investment assets depend largely on our interest rate spread, represented by the relationship between the yield on our interest-earning assets, primarily securitized assets, and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily securitized borrowings. Interest rate spreads are impacted by several factors, including forward interest rates, general economic factors, and the quality of the loans in our portfolio. 
 Sensitivity Analysis 
 We utilize a sensitivity analysis to assess our market risk associated with changes in interest rates. This sensitivity analysis attempts to assess the potential impact to earnings based on hypothetical changes in interest rates. 
 We estimate the fair value of the outstanding mortgage loans and related liabilities using a process that combines the use of a DCF model and analysis of current market data. The cash flow assumptions used in the model are based on various factors. Refer to Note 6 - Fair Value in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the key assumptions and valuation techniques. 
 Our total market risk is impacted by a variety of other factors including market spreads and the liquidity of the markets. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented, including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time. 
 The sensitivities presented are hypothetical and should be evaluated with care. The effect on fair value of a 25 bps variation in assumptions generally cannot be determined because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the fair value may not be linear. Additionally, the impact of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value is calculated while holding other assumptions constant. In reality, changes in one factor may lead to changes in other factors, which could impact the above hypothetical effects. 
 The following table summarizes the estimated change in the fair value of our significant assets and liabilities sensitive to interest rates as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 Down 25 bps Up 25 bps Increase (decrease) in assets Loans held for investment, subject to HMBS related obligations 31,051 (30,833) Loans held for investment, subject to nonrecourse debt: Reverse mortgage loans 122,748 (120,592) Commercial mortgage loans 75 (75) Loans held for investment: Reverse mortgage loans 6,709 (6,460) Total assets 160,583 (157,960) Increase (decrease) in liabilities HMBS related obligations 26,918 (26,684) Nonrecourse debt 49,275 (49,145) Total liabilities 76,193 (75,829) 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be 
 87 

considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, and the information described above in this Item 4, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The risks described in the Form 10-K and this Quarterly Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.

 Executive Compensation Matters 
 On November 7, 2024, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company granted options to certain officers of the Company, in recognition of their leadership and service to the Company, including in connection with recent strategic initiatives. Grants were made to the Company s named executive officers and chief financial officer, in the amounts set forth below pursuant to the Finance of America Companies Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the form of Option Grant Notice and Option Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The options vest on the second anniversary from the date of grant (subject to the officer s continued employment on the vesting date), are exercisable for a period of five years from the date of grant (on a one-for-one basis for Class A LLC Units of FoA Equity, which are exchangeable for shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company on a one-for-one basis), and have an exercise price equal to 25.00, which exceeds the fair market value of one share of Class A Common Stock of the Company on the date of grant.
