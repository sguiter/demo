FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 The Corporation has made, and may continue to make, certain forward-looking statements with respect to its financial condition, results of operations and business. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "may," "should," "will," "could," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "continue," "anticipates," "believes," "plans," "expects," "future," "intends," "projects," the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements may include projections of, or guidance on, the Corporation's future financial performance, expected levels of future expenses, including future credit losses, anticipated growth strategies, descriptions of new business initiatives and anticipated trends in the Corporation's business or financial results. 
 
 Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts, nor assurance of future performance. Instead, the statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of the Corporation's business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Corporation's control, and actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not unduly rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement is based only on information currently available and speaks only as of the date when made. The Corporation undertakes no obligation, other than as required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Many factors could affect future financial results including, without limitation: 
 
 the impact of adverse conditions in the economy and financial markets, including increasing or elevated interest rates and elevated levels of inflation, on the performance of the Corporation's loan portfolio and demand for the Corporation's products and services; 
 the potential impacts of recent events affecting the financial services industry on the Corporation, including increased competition for, and costs of, deposits and other funding sources, more stringent regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and interest rate risk management and capital adequacy and increased FDIC insurance expenses; 
 the effects of actions by the federal government, including those of the Federal Reserve Board and other government agencies, that impact the money supply and market interest rates; 
 the effects of market interest rates, and the relative balances of interest rate-sensitive assets to interest rate-sensitive liabilities, on NIM and net interest income; 
 the composition of the Corporation's loan portfolio, including commercial mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans, which collectively represent a majority of the loan portfolio, may expose the Corporation to increased credit risk; 
 the effects of changes in interest rates on demand for the Corporation's products and services; 
 investment securities gains and losses, including declines in the fair value of securities, which may result in changes to earnings or shareholders' equity; 
 the effects of changes in interest rates or disruptions in liquidity markets on the Corporation's sources of funding; 
 4 

capital and liquidity strategies, including the Corporation's ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements, and the Corporation's ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; 
 the effects of competition on deposit rates and growth, loan rates and growth and NIM;

 the impact of operational risks, including the risk of human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, computer and telecommunications systems failures, faulty or incomplete data and an inadequate risk management framework; 
 the loss of, or failure to safeguard, confidential or proprietary information; 
 the Corporation's failure to identify and adequately and promptly address cybersecurity risks, including data breaches and cyberattacks; 
 the impact of failures from third-party vendors upon which the Corporation relies to perform in accordance with contractual arrangements and the effects of concerns about other financial institutions on the Corporation; 
 the potential to incur losses in connection with repurchase and indemnification payments related to sold loans; 
 the potential effects of climate change on the Corporation's business and results of operations; 
 the potential effects of increases in non-performing assets, which may require the Corporation to increase the ACL, charge-off loans and incur elevated collection and carrying costs related to such non-performing assets; 
 the determination of the ACL, which depends significantly upon assumptions and judgments with respect to a variety of factors, including the performance of the loan portfolio, the weighted-average remaining lives of different classifications of loans within the loan portfolio and current and forecasted economic conditions, among other factors; 
 the effects of the extensive level of regulation and supervision to which the Corporation and Fulton Bank are subject; 
 changes in regulation and government policy, which could result in significant changes in banking and financial services regulation; 
 the continuing impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Corporation's business and results of operations; 
 the potential for negative consequences resulting from regulatory violations, investigations and examinations, including potential supervisory actions, the assessment of fines and penalties, the imposition of sanctions, the need to undertake remedial actions and possible damage to the Corporation's reputation; 
 the effects of adverse outcomes in litigation and governmental or administrative proceedings; 
 the effects of changes in U.S. federal, state or local tax laws; 
 the effects of the significant amounts of time and expense associated with regulatory compliance and risk management; 
 the Corporation s ability to realize anticipated reductions in non-interest expense and increases in revenue from strategic initiatives implemented from time to time intended to simplify its operating model, improve its relationship banking focus, increase productivity and enhance the customer experience; 
 completed and potential acquisitions, including but not limited to the Republic First Transaction, may affect costs and the Corporation may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions; 
 the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the Republic First Transaction, including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains, are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or challenges arising from, the integration of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities into the Corporation, potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, or as a result of other unexpected factors or events;

 the possibility of increased scrutiny by, and/or additional regulatory requirements of, governmental authorities as a result of the Republic First Transaction; 
 potential exposure to unknown or contingent risks and liabilities the Corporation has acquired, or may acquire, or target for acquisition, including in connection with the purchase and assumption of certain assets and liabilities in connection with the Republic First Transaction; 
 geopolitical conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism, actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to acts or threats of terrorism and/or military conflicts, including the war between Russia and Ukraine and escalating conflict in the Middle East, which could impact business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad; 
 public health crises and pandemics and their effects on the economic and business environments in which the Corporation operates, including on the Corporation's credit quality and business operations, as well as the impact on general economic and financial market conditions; 
 the Corporation's ability to achieve its growth plans; 
 the Corporation's ability to attract and retain talented personnel; 
 5 

the effects of competition from financial service companies and other companies offering bank services;

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1

NOTE 2 
 
 billion of assets of Republic First Bank and received approximately billion of cash from the FDIC. The Bank assumed approximately billion of total liabilities of Republic First Bank. The Bank did not enter into a loss sharing arrangement with the FDIC in connection with the Republic First Transaction. 
 
 As a result of the Republic First Transaction, the Bank enhanced its presence in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
 
 The Republic First Transaction constitutes a business combination as defined by FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are presented at their estimated fair values based on preliminary valuations as of the Acquisition Date. The determination of estimated fair values required management to make certain estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows and market conditions at the time of the Republic First Transaction. 
 
 The Bank is awaiting conclusion of the customary final settlement process to determine whether certain assets and liabilities of Republic First Bank will be acquired by the Bank. Until management finalizes its fair value estimates for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, the preliminary gain on acquisition can be updated for a period not to exceed one year following the Acquisition Date. The preliminary fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, provide a reasonable basis for determining the preliminary gain on acquisition. During the third quarter of 2024, adjustments to the estimated fair values of certain assets acquired were recorded, resulting in a million reduction in the preliminary gain on acquisition, net of income taxes. 
 
 The excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired and the cash consideration received from the FDIC over the estimated fair value of liabilities assumed was recorded as a preliminary gain on acquisition of million, net of income taxes.

Assets acquired: Cash and due from banks Investment securities Loans Premises and equipment CDI FHLB Stock Accrued interest receivable Other assets Total assets Liabilities assumed: Deposits Borrowings Accrued interest payable Other liabilities Total liabilities Net assets acquired: ) Gain on acquisition, before income taxes Gain on acquisition, net of income taxes 
 
 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of major categories of assets 
 acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 
 Cash and due from banks: The fair values of cash and due from banks approximate their book values. 
 
 Investment securities: The investment portfolio acquired in the Republic First Transaction, with a fair value of billion, was sold shortly after the Acquisition Date. The fair value of the investment portfolio was based on the proceeds from the sale. 
 
 Loans: The Corporation recorded billion of acquired loans at their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value for the loans was based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered credit loss and prepayment expectations, market interest rates and other market factors from the perspective of a market participant. Loan cash flows were generated on an individual loan basis. The PD, LGD, exposure at default and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit losses that are embedded in the estimated cash flows.

 The following table summarizes PCD Loans: 
 April 26, 2024 (dollars in thousands) Book balance of loans with deteriorated credit quality at acquisition Fair value of loans with deteriorated credit quality at acquisition Fair value discount PCD Loans credit discount ) Non-credit discount 
 
 The Republic First Transaction resulted in the addition of million to the ACL, including the million identified in the table above for PCD Loans, and 23.4 million recorded through the provision for credit losses at the Acquisition Date for non-PCD Loans. 
 
 Intangible assets: The Corporation recorded million of CDI reflected in other assets that is being amortized over using the sum-of-the-years digits method. The estimated fair value of the CDI was determined using the cost savings approach. The cost savings approach is defined as the difference between the cost of funds of core deposits and an alternative cost of funds for those deposits. The CDI estimated fair value was determined by projecting discounted net cash flows that included assumptions related to customer attrition rates, discount rates, deposit interest rates, deposit account maintenance costs and alternative cost of funding rates. 
 
 FHLB stock: The Corporation acquired million of FHLB stock. The estimated fair value of the FHLB stock approximated its book value. 
 
 Accrued interest receivable: The Corporation acquired million of accrued interest receivable. The fair value of the accrued interest receivable approximated its book value. 
 
 Core deposits: Demand deposits, savings and money market deposits and time deposits (less than 250,000) were recorded at book value which approximated fair value. The Corporation recorded million of CDI in other assets for these deposits. 
 
 Time deposits: Time deposits of 250,000 and greater were valued based on a comparison with the contractual cost of a portfolio of brokered deposits having a similar tenor. As the time deposit portfolio had a remaining average life of approximately three months, the estimated fair value of the time deposits approximated their book value and no adjustment was recorded. 
 
 Borrowings: Borrowings assumed in the Republic First Transaction, with a fair value of billion, were repaid shortly after the Acquisition Date. The fair value of borrowings was based on the repayment amounts.

Net occupancy Professional fees Charitable donation Other 
 
 In connection with the Republic First Transaction, Fulton Bank made a million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation 
 to provide additional impact grants to nonprofit community organizations across the region that share Fulton Bank's vision of advancing economic empowerment, particularly in underserved communities. 
 
 On July 18, 2024, the Corporation announced a plan to close of the Bank's financial center offices and consolidate the operations of those offices into nearby financial center offices operated by the Bank. The plan was adopted as part of the Bank's integration of the assets acquired and the deposits and certain other liabilities assumed in the Republic First Transaction. The premises and equipment of the locations include locations owned by the Bank and locations leased by the Bank. The Corporation recorded pre-tax costs of approximately million reflected in acquisition-related expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of write-offs of premises and equipment and related expenses, and lease termination charges. The financial centers are expected to close on or about November 22, 2024. 
 
 Unaudited Pro Forma Information: 
 
 The amount of net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expense and net income of million, million, million and million, respectively, attributable to the Republic First Transaction were included in the Corporation's unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Included in non-interest income above is million related to the gain on acquisition, net of tax. Net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expense and net income shown above reflect management's best estimates based on information available as of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Republic First Bank does not have historical financial information on which the Corporation could base pro forma information. Additionally, the Bank did not acquire all of the assets or assume all of the liabilities of Republic First Bank. Therefore, it is impracticable to provide pro forma information on revenues and earnings for the Republic First Transaction in accordance with ASC 805-10-50-2.

 The Corporation's collateralized mortgage obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities have contractual terms that generally do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. The change in fair value of these securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. The Corporation does not have the intent to sell and does not believe it will more likely than not be required to sell any of these securities prior to a recovery of their fair value to amortized cost. Therefore, the Corporation did not record a loss on these investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no ACL was required for the Corporation's state and municipal securities. The Corporation does not have the intent to sell and does not believe it will more likely than not be required to sell any of these securities prior to a recovery of their fair value to amortized cost, which may be at maturity. Therefore, the Corporation did not record a loss on these investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The majority of the corporate debt securities were rated at or above investment grade as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Based on the payment status, rating and management's evaluation of these securities, no ACL was required for corporate debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The ACL consists of reserves against loans that have been evaluated collectively and individually for expected credit losses. The ACL represents an estimate of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loans as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to net loans. The ACL is increased by charges to expense, through the provision for credit losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The reserve for OBS credit exposures includes estimated losses on unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit and other OBS credit exposures.

 The ACL may include qualitative adjustments intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative models. In determining qualitative adjustments, management considers changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and their impact on the lending environment, including underwriting standards and other factors affecting credit losses over the remaining life of each loan. 
 
 The increase in the ACL - loans as of September 30, 2024 was primarily due to loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction. 
 
 Collateral-Dependent Loans 
 
 A loan or a lease is considered to be collateral-dependent when the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. For all classes of loans and leases deemed collateral-dependent, the Corporation elected the practical expedient to estimate expected credit losses based on the collateral s fair value less cost to sell. Substantially all of the collateral supporting collateral-dependent loans or leases consists of various 
 types of real estate, including residential properties, commercial properties, such as retail centers, office buildings, and lodging, agricultural land, and vacant land. Commercial and industrial loans may also be secured by real estate. 
 
 All loans individually evaluated for impairment are measured for losses on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, substantially all of the Corporation's individually evaluated loans with total commitments greater than or equal to million were measured based on the estimated fair value of each loan s collateral, if any. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately and , respectively, of loans evaluated individually for impairment with principal balances greater than or equal to million, whose primary collateral consisted of real estate, were measured at estimated fair value using appraisals performed by state certified third-party appraisers that had been updated in the preceding 12 months. 
 
 Non-accrual Loans 
 
 Commercial and industrial Real estate - residential mortgage Real estate - home equity Real estate - construction Consumer Leases and other loans 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were million and million, respectively, of non-accrual loans that did not have a specific valuation allowance within the ACL. The estimated fair values of the collateral securing these loans exceeded their carrying amount, or the loans were previously charged down to realizable collateral values. Accordingly, no specific valuation allowance was considered to be necessary. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 
 Maintaining an appropriate ACL is dependent on various factors, including the ability to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner. For commercial construction, commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate, an internal risk rating process is used. The Corporation believes that internal risk ratings are the most relevant credit quality indicator for these types of loans. The migration of loans through the various internal risk categories is a significant component of the ACL methodology for these loans, which bases the PD on this migration. Assigning risk ratings involves judgment. The Corporation's loan review officers provide a separate assessment of risk rating accuracy. Risk ratings may be changed based on the ongoing monitoring procedures performed by loan officers or credit administration staff, or if specific loan review assessments identify a deterioration or an improvement in a loan.

The Corporation considers the performance of the loan portfolio and its impact on the ACL. The Corporation does not assign internal risk ratings to smaller balance, homogeneous loans, such as home equity, residential mortgage, construction loans to individuals secured by residential real estate, consumer and other loans. For these loans, the most relevant credit quality indicator is delinquency status and the Corporation evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan.

 Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 
 The Corporation modifies loans by providing a concession when deemed appropriate. Depending on the circumstances, a term extension, interest rate reduction or principal forgiveness may be granted. In certain instances, a combination of concessions may be provided to a borrower. 
 
 When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of principal forgiven is deemed to be uncollectible and the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the amount of the forgiven portion, with a corresponding reduction to the ACL.

 Originations of MSRs Amortization ) ) ) ) Balance at end of period Estimated fair value of MSRs at end of period 
 
 MSRs represent the economic value of contractual rights to service mortgage loans that have been sold. The total portfolio of mortgage loans serviced by the Corporation for unrelated third parties was billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Actual and expected prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans can impact the fair values of the MSRs. The Corporation accounts for MSRs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. 
 
 The fair value of MSRs is estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows from servicing income, net of expense, over the expected life of the underlying loans at a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with these assets. Expected life is based on the contractual terms of the loans, as adjusted for prepayment projections. The fair values of MSRs were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Based on its fair value analysis as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation determined that valuation allowance was required as of September 30, 2024.

billion. As the hedged transaction continues to be probable, the original unrealized loss of million included in AOCI will be recognized as a reduction to interest income when the previously forecasted hedged item affects earnings in future periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, million of these unrealized losses have been reclassified as a reduction of interest income on loans, including fees, on the Corporation's consolidated statements of income. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2023, the Corporation transitioned certain of the Corporation's legacy commercial customer back-to-back interest rate swap transactions from LIBOR to SOFR. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase to other non-interest income to reflect market valuation movements from the transition from LIBOR to SOFR was million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the full-year reduction to other non-interest income related to the transition from LIBOR to SOFR was million.

OREO MSRs (1) 
 Total assets 
 (1) Amounts shown are estimated fair value. MSRs are recorded on the Corporation's consolidated balance sheets at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. 
 See "Note 6 - Mortgage Servicing Rights" for additional information. 
 
 The valuation techniques used to measure fair value for the items in the table above are as follows: 
 
 Loans, net This category consists of loans that were individually evaluated for impairment and have been classified as Level 3 assets. The amount shown is the balance of non-accrual loans, net of related ACL. See "Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses," for additional details. 
 
 OREO This category consists of OREO classified as Level 3 assets, for which the fair values were based on estimated selling prices less estimated selling costs for similar assets in active markets. 
 
 MSRs This category consists of MSRs, which were initially recorded at fair value upon the sale of residential mortgage loans to secondary market investors, and subsequently carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. MSRs are amortized as a reduction to servicing income over the estimated lives of the underlying loans. MSRs are stratified by product type and evaluated for impairment by comparing each stratum's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. Fair values are determined at the end of each quarter through a discounted cash flows valuation performed by a third-party valuation expert. Significant inputs to the valuation included expected net servicing income, the discount rate and the expected life of the underlying loans.

 Residential Lending 
 
 The Corporation originates and sells residential mortgages to secondary market investors. The Corporation provides customary representations and warranties to secondary market investors that specify, among other things, that the loans have been underwritten to the standards of the secondary market investor. The Corporation may be required to repurchase specific loans or reimburse the investor for a credit loss incurred on a sold loan if it is determined that the representations and warranties have not been met. Under some agreements with secondary market investors, the Corporation may have additional credit exposure beyond customary representations and warranties, based on the specific terms of those agreements.

 Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Corporation is involved in various pending and threatened claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Corporation evaluates the possible impact of these matters, taking into consideration the most recent information available. A loss reserve is established for those matters for which the Corporation believes a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Once established, the reserve is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any subsequent developments. Actual losses with respect to any such matter may be more or less than the amount estimated by the Corporation. For matters where a loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated by the Corporation, no loss reserve is established. 
 
 In addition, from time to time, the Corporation is involved in investigations or other forms of regulatory or governmental inquiry covering a range of possible issues and, in some cases, these may be part of similar reviews of the specified activities of other companies. These inquiries or investigations could lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings involving the Corporation, and could result in fines, penalties, restitution, other types of sanctions, or the need for the Corporation to undertake remedial actions, or to alter its business, financial or accounting practices. The Corporation's practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental inquiries and investigations. 
 
 As of the date of this report, the Corporation believes that any liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, that may result from the final outcomes of pending legal proceedings, or regulatory or governmental inquiries or investigations, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation. However, legal proceedings, inquiries and investigations are often unpredictable, and it is possible that the ultimate resolution of any such matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the Corporation's results of operations in any future period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or liability imposed and the operating results for the period, and could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business. In addition, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such legal proceeding, inquiry or investigation, any such matter could cause the Corporation to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and possibly material, to the Corporation's results of operations in any future period.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 This Management's Discussion relates to the Corporation, a financial holding company registered under the BHCA and corporation incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. This Management's Discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 The Corporation is a financial holding company, which, through its wholly owned banking subsidiary, provides a full range of retail and commercial financial services in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. 
 
 The Corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income, or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and maintaining or increasing the NIM, which is FTE net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through gains on sales of assets, such as loans, investments and properties. Offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans and OBS credit risks, non-interest expenses and income taxes. 
 
 The following table presents a summary of the Corporation's earnings and selected performance ratios:

 Acquisition of Substantially all of the Assets and Assumption of Substantially all of the Deposits and Certain Liabilities of Republic First Bank from the FDIC 
 
 On the Acquisition Date, Fulton Bank acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the deposits and certain liabilities of Republic First Bank from the FDIC, as receiver for Republic First Bank. As part of the Republic First Transaction, the Bank acquired approximately 4.8 billion of assets of Republic First Bank and assumed approximately 5.6 billion of liabilities of Republic First Bank. The Bank received approximately 0.8 billion of cash from the FDIC in connection with the Republic First Transaction. 

36 

As a result of the Republic First Transaction, the Bank enhanced its presence in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
 
 In connection with the Republic First Transaction, Fulton Bank made a 5.0 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation to provide additional impact grants to nonprofit community organizations across the region that share Bank s vision of advancing economic empowerment, particularly in underserved communities. 
 
 On July 18, 2024, the Corporation announced a plan to close 13 of the Bank's financial center offices and consolidate the operations of those offices into nearby financial center offices operated by the Bank. The plan was adopted as part of the Bank's integration of the assets acquired and the deposits and certain other liabilities assumed in the Republic First Transaction. The premises and equipment of the 13 locations include five locations owned by the Bank and eight locations leased by the Bank. The Corporation recorded pre-tax costs of approximately 9.8 million reflected in acquisition-related expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of write-offs of premises and equipment and related expenses, and lease termination charges. The financial centers are expected to close on or about November 22, 2024. 
 
 See "Note 2 - Business Combinations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, "Item 1. Financial Statements." 
 
 Common Stock Offering 
 
 On May 1, 2024, the Corporation completed its previously announced underwritten public offering of 19,166,667 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of 15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts. The net proceeds to the Corporation from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses were approximately 272.6 million. 
 
 The Corporation intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including to support new opportunities in connection with the Republic First Transaction. 
 
 Sale-Leaseback Transaction 
 
 On May 10, 2024, the Bank and Fulton Financial Realty Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, entered into the Sale-Leaseback Transaction and received an aggregate cash purchase price of 55.4 million. The Bank leased each of the locations sold in the Sale-Leaseback Transaction for an initial term of 15 years, with the option to extend the term of each for up to three successive terms of up to five years each. The Corporation recorded a pre-tax gain, after deduction of transaction-related expenses, of approximately 20.3 million in connection with the Sale-Leaseback Transaction during the second quarter of 2024. See "Note 13 - Leases" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements." 
 
 Securities Restructuring 
 
 In May 2024, the Corporation sold approximately 345.7 million AFS securities and recorded a pre-tax loss of 20.3 million during the second quarter of 2024. The proceeds from the sale were reinvested into higher-yielding securities of a similar type and similar duration.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The Corporation's accounting policies are fundamental to understanding Management s Discussion. Critical policies are those that the Corporation considers to be most important to the presentation of its financial condition and results of operations, because they require management's most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 
 The Corporation's critical accounting policies are described in Part II, "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Based Financial Measures 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains supplemental financial information, as detailed below, that has been derived by methods other than GAAP. The Corporation has presented these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Corporation's results of operations. Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how the Corporation evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Corporation's industry. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP measures, are also useful to investors to evaluate the Corporation's results. Investors should recognize that the Corporation's presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures, and the Corporation strongly encourages a review of its consolidated financial statements in their entirety.

The following table summarizes the changes in FTE interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average balances (volume) and changes in yields and rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the same period in 2023: 
 2024 vs. 2023 Increase (Decrease) due to change in Volume Yield/Rate Net (dollars in thousands) FTE Interest income on: Net loans (1) 
 45,403 26,590 71,993 Investment securities 2,255 8,324 10,579 Other interest-earning assets 14,515 181 14,696 Total interest income 62,173 35,095 97,268 Interest expense on: Demand deposits 7,544 12,534 20,078 Savings and money market deposits 5,512 9,688 15,200 Brokered deposits (1,306) 400 (906) Time deposits 17,951 8,845 26,796 Borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities (5,395) (2,654) (8,049) Total interest expense 24,306 28,813 53,119 
 (1) Average balance includes non-performing loans. 
 
 Note: Changes which are partially attributable to both volume and rate are allocated to the volume and rate components presented above based on the percentage of direct changes that are attributable to each component. 
 
 Compared to the third quarter of 2023, FTE total interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 97.3 million, or 29.1 , primarily due to an increase of 62.2 million attributable to changes in volume, of which 45.4 million related to average net loans. Also contributing to the increase in FTE total interest income was 35.1 million attributable to changes in yield, of which 26.6 million related to net loans. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 54 bps in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Overall, the increase in FTE interest income was largely due to net loans acquired and cash received in the Republic First Transaction. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, interest expe nse increa sed 53.1 million comp ar ed to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in the rate on interest-bearing liabilities resulting in a 28.8 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense attributable to rate was driven by increases in the rates on demand deposits, savings and money market deposits and time deposits. The increase in interest expense attributable to volume was primarily due to increases in average time deposits. The increase in interest expense on deposits was in part due to deposits assumed in the Republic First Transaction. 
 
 Average loans and average FTE yields, by type, are summarized in the following table:

During the third quarter of 2024, average net loans increased 3.0 billion, or 14.3 , c ompared to the same period in 2023. The increase in average net loans was primarily due to 2.5 billion of average net loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction. Excluding the Republic First Transaction, average net loans increased 514.4 million largely due to increases of 371.1 million and 321.0 million in average commercial mortgage loans and average residential mortgage loans, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of 111.0 million in average commercial and industrial loans. 
 
 The yield on total loans increased 48 bps to 6.20 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 5.72 for the same period in 2023, primarily due to net loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction being accounted for at current market interest rates. 
 
 Average deposits and average interest rates, by type, are summarized in the following table:

 The cost of deposits increased 68 bps, to 2.24 , for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.56 for the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in rates and a change in the mix of deposits. 
 
 Average deposits increased 4.4 billion during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to 3.8 billion of average deposits assumed in the Republic First Transaction. Excluding the Republic First Transaction, average deposits increased 632.2 million largely due to increases of 1.1 billion, 377.0 million, 127.5 million in average time deposits, average savings and money market deposits, and average interest-bearing demand deposits, respectively, partially offset by decreases of 868.3 million and 128.0 million in average noninterest-bearing demand deposits and average brokered deposits, respectively. 
 
 Average borrowings and interest rates, by type, are summarized in the following table:

 (1) Includes repurchase agreements, short-term promissory notes, capital leases and collateral liabilities. 
 
 Average borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities decreased 461.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in average borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to decreases in average Federal funds purchased and average FHLB advances of 634.2 million and 39.0 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in average other borrowings and interest-bearing liabilities of 215.6 million.

 Compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, non-interest income before gain on acquisition, net of tax, and investment securities (losses) increased 11.4 million, or 20.4 . The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to a 3.0 million reduction to other non-interest income to reflect market valuation movement in certain of the Corporation's legacy commercial customer back-to-back interest rate swap transactions resulting from the transition from LIBOR to SOFR in the third quarter of 2023 and 2.6 million from acquired operations in the Republic First Transaction. Also contributing to the increase in non-interest income were increases of 2.2 million in wealth management revenues due to an increase in assets under management, 1.2 million in cash management fee income due to an increase in account analysis fees with customers electing to move funds to interest-bearing deposit accounts and 1.1 million in other commercial banking income driven by 0.5 million in gains on SBA loan sales.

 Non-interest expense increased 55.1 million, or 32.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Excluding FultonFirst implementation and asset disposal costs and acquisition-related expenses, non-interest expense increased 31.5 million, or 18.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to 28.7 million from the acquired operations in the Republic First Transaction and 5.2 million in salaries and benefits expense driven by annual merit increases, an increase in the number of employees and higher incentive compensation expense. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Corporation's ETR was 20.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the impact from the (7.7) million adjustment on the gain on acquisition, net of tax, the Corporation's ETR was 18.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 18.9 for the same period in 2023.

 Note: Changes which are partially attributable to both volume and rate are allocated to the volume and rate components presented above based on the percentage of direct changes that are attributable to each component. 
 
 Compared to the same period in 2023, FTE total interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 233.0 million due to increases of 121.9 million attributable to changes in yield, of which 99.4 million was attributable to net loans, and 111.2 million attributable to changes in volume, of which 91.8 million was attributable to average net loans. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 63 bps in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in FTE interest income was largely due to net loans and cash acquired in the Republic First Transaction. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, int erest expense increased 168.3 million comp ared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by an increase in the rate on interest-bearing liabilities resulting in an 112.8 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense attributable to rate was driven by increases in the rates on average savings and money market deposits, average demand deposits and average time deposits. The increase in interest expense attributable to volume was 55.6 million primarily driven by increases in average time deposits and average demand deposits. The increase in interest expense on deposits was in part due to deposits assumed in the Republic First Transaction.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 The provision for credit losses was 54.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 44.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to the Republic First Transaction, which included a provision for credit losses of 23.4 million for non-PCD Loans, partially offset by an elevated level of provision for credit losses in the same period in 2023 due to a 13.3 million charge-off for a commercial office loan.

 Non-interest expense increased 104.5 million, or 21.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Excluding the gain on the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, acquisition-related expenses and FultonFirst implementation and asset disposal costs, non-interest expense increased 74.7 million, or 15.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in non-interest expense was largely due to 49.4 million from acquired operations in the Republic First Transaction and 25.8 million in salaries and benefits expense driven by annual merit increases, an increase in the number of employees, higher incentive compensation expense and lower deferred costs from loan origination activities. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Corporation's ETR was 14.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the impact from the 39.7 million gain on acquisition, net of tax, the Corporation's ETR was 17.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.8 for the same period in 2023.

 Compared to December 31, 2023, total AFS securities at September 30, 2024 increased 914.9 million, or 38.1 . The increase in AFS securities at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to increases in residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of 698.8 million and 638.0 million, respectively, partially 
 52 

offset by decreases in state and municipal securities and corporate debt securities of 220.7 million and 144.0 million, respectively. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total HTM securities decreased 35.9 million compared to December 31, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease of 33.8 million in residential mortgage-backed securities due to payments. 
 
 Loans 
 
 The following table presents ending net loans outstanding by type:

 (2) Includes unearned income of 34.8 million for September 30, 2024 and 38.0 million for December 31, 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loans increased 2.8 billion, or 13.2 , compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in net loans during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to net loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction of 2.5 billion based on preliminary fair values as of the Acquisition Date. Excluding net loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction, net loans increased 340.1 million, or 1.6 , largely due to increases of 341.7 million and 241.5 million in commercial mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans, respectively, partially offset by decreases of 116.0 million, 94.7 million and 61.5 million in commercial and industrial loans, consumer loans and construction loans, respectively. 
 
 The Corporation does not have a significant concentration of credit risk with any single borrower. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 10.8 billion, or 44.8 , of the loan portfolio was comprised of commercial mortgage loans and construction loans. 
 
 The Corporation has established lower total lending limits for certain types of commercial lending commitments and lower total lending limits based on the Corporation's internal risk rating of an individual borrower at the time the lending commitment is approved. The Corporation adheres to loan portfolio management practices, which include requiring an annual review of the majority of loans. Additionally, management monitors the loan portfolio throughout the year taking into account, among other things, the size, complexity and level risk of loans and individual borrowers. An independent loan review function assesses the portfolio for internal risk rating accuracy and loan servicing policy requirements. The Corporation consolidates risk migrations to identify emerging risks by industry and real estate property types, taking into consideration economic forecasts and industry trends. Recently, the Corporation identified the office and multi-family commercial mortgage loan portfolios as posing heightened risks and consequently moderated the volume of new loan originations. The Corporation takes a risk-based approach when reviewing a specific loan portfolio, such as the office loan or multi-family loan portfolios. The Corporation reviews portfolio concentrations and adjusts the lending limits based on asset quality, economic forecasts and industry outlook.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-accrual loans increased by approximately 54.2 million, or 44.6 , largely due to additions to non-accrual loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction of 25.6 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-accrual loans as a percentage of total net loans increased to 0.73 , compared to 0.57 as of December 31, 2023.

 Non-performing loans at September 30, 2024 increased 48.8 million, or 31.8 , compared to 153.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in non-performing loans during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to additions to non-performing loans from the Republic First Transaction of 26.6 million. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total net loans were 0.84 and 0.72 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See "Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details on non-performing loans. 
 56 

The ability to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner is important to maintaining an adequate ACL. For commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgages and commercial construction loans to commercial borrowers, an internal risk rating process is used to monitor credit quality. The evaluation of credit risk for residential mortgages, home equity loans, construction loans to individuals, consumer loans and leases and other loans is based on payment history, through the monitoring of delinquency levels and trends. 
 
 Total internally risk-rated loans were 15.5 billion and 13.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, of which 2.1 billion and 0.9 billion were criticized and classified, respectively. For a description of the Corporation's risk ratings, see "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The following table presents criticized and classified loans, or those with internal risk ratings of special mention or substandard or lower for commercial mortgages, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans to commercial borrowers, by class segment:

 The increase of 858.2 million in special mention loans as of September 30, 2024 was primarily due to loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction with a balance of 721.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The increase of 336.1 million in substandard or lower loans as of September 30, 2024 was primarily due to loans acquired in the Republic First Transaction with a balance of 171.7 million as of September 30, 2024.

 Deposits and Borrowings 
 
 The following table presents ending deposits by type: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Increase (Decrease) (dollars in thousands) Noninterest-bearing demand 5,501,699 5,314,094 187,605 3.5 Interest-bearing demand 7,779,472 5,722,695 2,056,777 35.9 Savings and money market deposits 7,740,595 6,616,901 1,123,694 17.0 Total demand and savings 21,021,766 17,653,690 3,368,076 19.1 Brokered deposits 843,473 1,144,692 (301,219) (26.3) Time deposits 4,286,905 2,739,241 1,547,664 56.5 Total deposits 26,152,144 21,537,623 4,614,521 21.4 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total deposits increased by 4.6 billion, or 21.4 , compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total deposits was largely due to 3.9 billion of deposits assumed in the Republic First Transaction. Excluding the Republic First Transaction, total deposits increased approximately 750.8 million largely due to increases of 898.2 million, 506.4 million and 185.8 million in time deposits, savings and money market deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits, respectively, partially offset by decreases of 505.9 million and 333.8 million in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and brokered deposits, respectively. 
 
 Total uninsured deposits were estimated to be 9.5 billion and 7.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Time deposits of 250 thousand or more were 1.1 billion and 551.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 (1) Includes repurchase agreements, short-term promissory notes and capital leases. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total borrowings decreased 435.3 million, or 17.5 , compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in total borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to decreases in Federal funds purchased, FHLB advances and other borrowings of 240.0 million, 150.0 million and 45.8 million, respectively. 
 
 Shareholders' Equity 
 
 On December 19, 2023, the Corporation announced that its Board of Directors approved the 2024 Repurchase Program. The 2024 Repurchase Program will expire on December 31, 2024. Under the 2024 Repurchase Program, the Corporation is authorized to repurchase up to 125.0 million of shares of its common stock through December 31, 2024. Under this authorization, up to 25.0 million of the 125 million authorization may be used to repurchase shares of the Corporation's preferred stock and outstanding subordinated notes. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1,934,297 shares were repurchased under the 2024 Repurchase Program at a total cost of 30.3 million, or 15.69 per share. No shares were repurchased during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 On May 1, 2024, the Corporation completed its previously announced underwritten public offering of 19,166,667 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of 15.00 per share, before underwriting discounts. The net proceeds to the Corporation from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses were approximately 272.6 million. 
 
 The Corporation intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including to support new opportunities in connection with the Republic First Transaction. 
 
 Regulatory Capital 
 
 The Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary bank, Fulton Bank, are subject to the Capital Rules administered by banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the Corporation's financial statements. 
 
 The Capital Rules require the Corporation and Fulton Bank to: 
 
 Meet a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50 of risk-weighted assets; 
 
 Meet a minimum Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio of 4.00 of average assets; 
 
 Meet a minimum Total capital ratio of 8.00 of risk-weighted assets and a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.00 of risk-weighted assets; 
 
 Maintain a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.50 above the minimum risk-based capital requirements, which must be maintained to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments; and 
 
 Comply with a revised definition of capital to improve the ability of regulatory capital instruments to absorb losses. Certain non-qualifying capital instruments, including cumulative preferred stock and TruPS, are excluded as a component of Tier 1 capital for institutions of the Corporation's size. 
 
 60 

As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation's capital levels met the minimum capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffers, as prescribed in the Capital Rules. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Fulton Bank met the well-capitalized requirements under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized, a bank must maintain minimum Total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, Common Equity Tier I risk-based and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the Capital Rules. There were no other conditions or events since September 30, 2024 that management believes have changed the Corporation's capital categories. 
 
 The following table summarizes the Corporation's capital ratios in comparison to regulatory requirements: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Regulatory Minimum for Capital Adequacy With Capital Conservation Buffer Total Risk-Based Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets) 14.0 14.0 8.0 10.5 Tier I Risk-Based Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets) 11.3 11.2 6.0 8.5 Common Equity Tier I (to Risk-Weighted Assets) 10.5 10.3 4.5 7.0 Tier I Leverage Capital (to Average Assets) 9.0 9.5 4.0 4.0 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments. The types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk, equity market price risk, debt security market price risk, foreign currency price risk and commodity price risk. Due to the nature of its operations, foreign currency price risk and commodity price risk are not significant to the Corporation. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk, Asset/Liability Management and Liquidity 
 
 Interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas. First, changes in rates have an impact on the Corporation's liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow. Second, movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the Corporation's net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity. 
 
 The Corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk. The Corporation's ALCO is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity positions of the Corporation, approving asset and liability management policies, and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions. 
 
 The Corporation uses two complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk. They are a simulation of net interest income and estimates of economic value of equity. Using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of the Corporation's interest rate risk, level of risk as time evolves, and exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 
 Simulation of net interest income is performed for the next 12-month period. A variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve. These results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario. Simulation of net interest income is used primarily to measure the Corporation's short-term earnings exposure to rate movements. The Corporation's policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income, in a non-parallel instantaneous shock, to 10 of the base case net interest income for a 100 bps shock in interest rates, 15 for a 200 bps shock, 20 for a 300 bps shock and 25 for a 400 bps shock. A "shock" is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates. The shocks do not take into account changes in customer behavior that could result in changes to mix and/or volumes in the balance sheet, nor does it take into account the potential effects of competition on the pricing of deposits and loans over the forward 12-month period. 
 
 Contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the simulation model as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio. Assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for non-maturity deposit accounts. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model's simulated results due to timing, amount and frequency 
 61 

of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies. 
 
 The following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate changes in rate-ramp scenarios over a 12-month period, that is, a gradual non-parallel shift, on net interest income as of September 30, 2024: 
 Rate Ramp (1) 
 Annual change in net interest income change in net interest income +400 bp + 28.7 million +2.6 +300 bp + 23.4 million +2.1 +200 bp + 17.5 million +1.6 +100 bp + 10.7 million +1.0 100 bp - 14.1 million -1.3 200 bp - 28.2 million -2.5 300 bp - 41.6 million -3.7 400 bp - 53.1 million -4.8 
 (1) These results include the effect of implicit and explicit interest rate floors that limit further reduction in interest rates. 
 
 The following table summarizes the expected impact of abrupt interest rate changes, that is, a non-parallel instantaneous shock, on net interest income as of September 30, 2024: 
 Rate Shock (1) 
 Annual change in net interest income change in net interest income +400 bp + 51.5 million +4.6 +300 bp + 41.3 million +3.7 +200 bp + 31.4 million +2.8 +100 bp + 22.4 million +2.0 100 bp - 32.8 million -3.0 200 bp - 62.4 million -5.6 300 bp - 88.9 million -8.0 400 bp - 114.3 million -10.3 
 (1) These results include the effect of implicit and explicit interest rate floors that limit further reduction in interest rates. 
 
 Economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows. Discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities. Abrupt changes or "shocks" in interest rates, both upward and downward, are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment. This measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer-term repricing risks and options in the Corporation's balance sheet. The Corporation's policy limits the economic value of equity that may be at risk, in a non-parallel instantaneous shock, to 10 of the base case economic value of equity for a 100 bps shock in interest rates, 20 for a 200 bps shock, 30 for a 300 bps shock and 40 for a 400 bps shock. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation was within economic value of equity policy limits for every 100 bps shock. 
 
 Interest Rate Derivatives 
 
 The Corporation enters into interest rate derivatives with certain qualifying commercial loan customers to meet their interest rate risk management needs. The Corporation simultaneously enters into interest rate derivatives with dealer counterparties, with identical notional amounts and terms. The net result of these interest rate derivatives is that the customer pays a fixed rate of interest and the Corporation receives a floating rate. These interest rate derivatives are derivative financial instruments, and the gross fair values are recorded in other assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value during the period recorded in other non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. 

62 

Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 The Corporation's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to reduce volatility in interest income and interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Corporation primarily uses interest rate derivatives as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The Corporation enters into interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing floating rate loans and borrowings. 
 
 For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified into interest income or interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income as interest payments are made on the Corporation's variable-rate liabilities. 
 
 In January 2023, the Corporation terminated interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with a combined notional amount of 1.0 billion. As the hedged transaction continues to be probable, the unrealized losses that have been recorded in AOCI will be recognized as a reduction to interest income when the previously forecasted hedged item affects earnings in future periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 21.2 million of these unrealized losses have been reclassified as a reduction of interest income on loans, including fees, on the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 In October 2024, the Corporation terminated a pay fixed, receive floating interest rate derivative designated as a cash flow hedge with a notional amount of 250.0 million. As the hedged transaction continues to be probable, the unrealized loss of 1.2 million included in AOCI will be recognized as an increase to interest expense when the previously forecasted hedged item affects earnings in future periods. 
 
 Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Corporation executed 900.0 million of receive fixed, pay floating interest rate derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk to manage the Corporation's exposure to interest rate movements. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The Corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the cash needs of its customers, who, as depositors, may want to withdraw funds or who, as borrowers, need credit availability. Liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments and outstanding loans and through the availability of deposits and borrowings. The Corporation also maintains secondary sources that provide liquidity on a secured and unsecured basis to meet short- and long-term needs. 
 
 The Corporation maintains liquidity sources in the form of interest-bearing deposits and customer funding (short-term promissory notes). The Corporation can access additional liquidity from these sources, if necessary, by increasing the rates of interest paid on those instruments. The positive impact to liquidity resulting from paying higher interest rates could have a detrimental impact on NIM and net interest income if rates on interest-earning assets do not experience a proportionate increase. Borrowing availability with the FHLB and the FRB, along with federal funds lines at various correspondent banks, provides the Corporation with additional liquidity. 
 
 Fulton Bank is a member of the FHLB and has access to FHLB overnight and term credit facilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had total borrowing capacity of approximately 10.7 billion with 5.0 billion of advances and letters of credit outstanding, for a remaining available borrowing capacity of approximately 5.7 billion under these facilities. Advances from the FHLB are secured by qualifying commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans, investments and other assets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had aggregate federal funds lines borrowing capacity of 2.6 billion with no amounts outstanding against that amount. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation had 1.5 billion of collateralized borrowing capacity at the FRB discount window with no amounts outstanding and had no borrowings drawn against the Bank Term Funding Program facility, which expired March 11, 2024. 
 
 A combination of commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, consumer loans and securities are pledged to the FRB of Philadelphia to provide access to FRB discount window borrowings. Securities carried at 0.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and 0.4 billion at December 31, 2023 were pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits. 
 
 Liquidity must also be managed at the Corporation's parent company level. For safety and soundness reasons, banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends. Generally, these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income. 
 63 

Management continues to monitor the liquidity and capital needs of the parent company including monitoring the granularity of the deposit portfolio and level of uninsured deposits. Management will implement appropriate strategies, as necessary, to remain adequately capitalized and to meet its cash needs. 
 
 The consolidated statements of cash flows provide additional information. The Corporation's operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 provided 288.7 million of cash. Cash provided by investing activities was 1.8 billion and was mainly due to the sale of AFS securities and net cash received in the Republic First Transaction. Cash used by financing activities was 1.2 billion primarily due to the repayment of borrowings. 
 
 Debt Security Market Price Risk 
 
 Debt security market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of debt securities, unrelated to interest rate changes, could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Corporation. The Corporation's debt security investments consist primarily of U.S. government-sponsored agency issued mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt securities. All of the Corporation's investments in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have principal payments that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. 
 
 State and Municipal Securities 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation owned securities issued by various states and municipalities with a total fair value of 0.9 billion. Uncertainty with respect to the financial strength of state and municipal bond insurers places emphasis on the underlying strength of issuers. Pressure on local tax revenues of issuers due to adverse economic conditions could have an adverse impact on the underlying credit quality of issuers. The Corporation evaluates existing and potential holdings primarily based on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing state or municipality and then, to a lesser extent, on any credit enhancement. State and municipal securities can be supported by the general obligation of the issuing state or municipality, allowing the securities to be repaid by any means available to the issuing state or municipality. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 100 of state and municipal securities were supported by the general obligation of corresponding states or municipalities. Approximately 73 of these securities were school district issuances, which are also supported by the states of the issuing municipalities. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation's management, including the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15, promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Corporation reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We review our internal controls over financial reporting on a regular basis and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. During the second quarter of 2024, as the result of the Republic First Transaction, we commenced the evaluation of the applicable controls, and designed and implemented new controls as needed. The evaluation of the changes to processes, information technology systems and other components of internal control over financial reporting related to the Republic First Transaction is ongoing. Otherwise, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
