 Liquidity and Going Concern 
 As a growth company in the early commercialization stage of its lifecycle, Eos is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the development of an enterprise. In this regard, substantially all of the Company s efforts to date have been devoted to the development and manufacturing of battery energy storage systems and complementary products and services, recruitment of management and technical staff, deployment of capital to expand the Company s operations to meet customer demand and raising capital to fund the Company s development. However, as a result of these efforts, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and expects to continue to incur such losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future until such time that the Company can reach a scale of profitability to sustain its operations. 
 In order to execute its development strategy, the Company has historically relied on outside capital through the issuance of equity, debt and borrowings under financing arrangements (collectively outside capital to fund its cost structure. While the Company believes its recent entry into new credit facilities as discussed below has significantly improved its capital position and provides a path to sustainable operations and profitability, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to achieve such profitability or do so in a manner that does not require additional outside capital. Moreover, while the Company has historically been successful in raising outside capital, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to obtain outside capital in the future or do so on terms that are acceptable to the Company, should it be needed. 
 As disclosed in Note 3, Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, on June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a financing transaction with CCM Denali Debt Holdings, LP, an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management LP (herein after referred to as Cerberus , Denali , Lender , Holder ). As a result of this transaction, Cerberus agreed to provide a secured multi-draw facility to be made in installments (the Delayed Draw Term Loan as well as a revolving credit facility Revolving Facility ), to be made available beginning June 21, 2026, at Cerberus sole discretion and only if the Delayed Draw Term Loan is fully funded. 
 As of the date the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were issued (the issuance date ), management evaluated the significance of the following negative financial conditions in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 205-40, Going Concern: 
 Since its inception, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash from operations in order to fund its development. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of , incurred negative cash flows from operations of and had an accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available to fund the Company s operations and working capital of , which includes loan commitment assets of classified as current assets on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 through the DOE s Clean Energy Financing Program. Certain technical, legal and financial conditions must be met and due diligence to the satisfaction of the DOE must be completed before the DOE enters into definitive financing documents with the Company and funds the loan. The Company continues to work with the DOE to meet these conditions and close the loan, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure such a loan or on terms that are acceptable to the Company. 
 The Company is required to remain in compliance with certain quarterly financial covenants under its Credit Agreement. These financial covenants include, as defined in the Credit Agreement, (a) Minimum Consolidated EBITDA, (b) Minimum Consolidated Revenue, and (c) Minimum Liquidity (collectively, the financial covenants ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants and non-financial covenants, except for the September 30, 2024 Minimum Consolidated Revenue financial covenant. The Company secured a waiver of non-compliance from Cerberus for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company expects it may be unable to remain in compliance with the Minimum Consolidated Revenue financial covenant beginning December 31, 2024, absent the Company s ability to secure a waiver or amend the Credit Agreement. In the event the Company is unable to comply with the financial and the non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2024, and the Company is unable to secure another waiver, Cerberus may, at its discretion, enter into a forbearance agreement with the Company and/or exercise any and all of its existing rights and remedies, which may include, among other things, asserting its rights in the Company s assets securing the loan. Moreover, the Company s other lenders may exercise similar rights and remedies under the cross-default provisions of their respective borrowing arrangements with the Company. 
 Cerberus funded the Company August Draw ), and the Company received , net of the original issue discount, since the Company met the milestones for the August Draw as disclosed in Note 3, Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction. Subsequently, on November 1, 2024, Cerberus funded the Company related to the October 31, 2024 tranche October Draw or October Tranche ), and the Company received , which is net of the original issue discount from the Delayed Draw Term Loan as disclosed in Note 21, Subsequent Events . In the event the Company does not achieve the remaining funding milestone, and Cerberus chooses not to continue funding, and the Company s ongoing efforts to raise additional outside capital prove unsuccessful, the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due over the next twelve months beyond the issuance date. In such an event, management will be required to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include, among others, a significant curtailment in the Company s operations, a sale of certain of the Company s assets, a sale of the entire Company to strategic or financial investors and/or allowing the Company to become insolvent. 
 These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates that the Company will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the preparation of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. 
 
 Series A-1, A-2, B-1, and B-2 Preferred Stock 
 As discussed in Note 3, Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, the shares of Series A-1 and A-2 Preferred Stock that were issued in June and August 2024, respectively, and subsequently converted into shares of Series B-1 and B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively, in September 2024 (collectively Series B Preferred Stock and together with Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock ), become redeemable based upon the passage of time and therefore meet the criteria to be classified within temporary equity. Management has elected to recognize changes in the redemption value pursuant to ASC 480-10-S99-3A-15(b). As a result, the Company will remeasure the Preferred Stock to the maximum redemption value at each reporting date but will never be adjusted below its initial carrying value. Adjustments are reflected in Additional paid in capital on the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Shareholder approval was obtained on September 10, 2024. 
 The SPA Warrant is exercisable at the holder s discretion for cash or on a cashless basis. The SPA Warrant is subject to automatic cashless exercise on the expiration date if the fair market value of one share is greater than the exercise price then in effect. Upon an acceleration under the Credit Agreement, the Company may be required to purchase the SPA Warrant from the holder at an amount equal to the closing sale price less the SPA Warrant price at the request of the holder. The SPA Warrant meets the criteria for liability classification under ASC 480 and is recognized at fair value with changes in fair value included in Change in fair value of derivatives - related parties in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.

The Company has the right to settle conversions in shares of common stock, cash, or any combination thereof. 
 The Conversion Option includes an exercise contingency, which requires the Company to obtain stockholder approval for conversions subject to the Exchange Cap. If stockholder approval of the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock is not obtained, following commercially reasonable efforts, the Company will be required to settle the conversion in excess of the Exchange Cap in cash.

Therefore, the embedded conversion feature is required to be bifurcated from the AFG Convertible Notes and accounted for at fair value at each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognized on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. The embedded derivative is presented on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of Notes payable - related party.

 Yorkville Convertible Promissory Notes - Related Party 
 In December 2022, February 2023, March of 2023, and April 2023, the Company issued convertible promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of in a private placement to Yorkville under the second and third supplemental agreements to the SEPA. The fair values of the convertible promissory notes at issuance were greater than the proceeds received. Accordingly, the Company recorded the excess of fair value of these promissory notes over the proceeds as Interest expense - related party in the amount of , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is reflected in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. 
 During the first half of 2023, Yorkville delivered Investor Notices requiring the Company to issue and sell an aggregate of shares of common stock to Yorkville to offset all outstanding amounts owed to Yorkville under the outstanding convertible promissory notes. The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment from the issuance of common stock from the outstanding convertible promissory notes of for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is reflected in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. 
 The conversion feature for each of the convertible promissory notes did not qualify for the scope exception to derivative accounting, therefore the conversion option was bifurcated from each convertible promissory note. The bifurcated derivatives were recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and subject to remeasurement at the debt extinguishment date, with changes in fair value recognized as a realized gain or loss in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Net gain of was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As of December 31, 2023, there were outstanding Yorkville convertible promissory notes.

 SPA Warrant 
 As discussed in Note 3, Credit Agreement and Securities Purchase Transaction, the Company issued to the Purchaser, one warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock. The warrant has a term, a per share exercise price, and is exercisable at the Purchaser s discretion for cash or on a cashless basis. Upon an acceleration under the Credit Agreement, the Company could be required to purchase the warrant from the holder at an amount equal to the most recently quoted price. Following stockholder approval on September 10, 2024, the Warrant Conversion Cap increased to . See Note 3, Credit Agreement and Securities Purchase Transaction for additional information on this transaction. 
 Contingent Warrants 
 Following the Initial Draw, on three separate predetermined draw dates upon the achievement of the corresponding performance milestone for each such draw date, the Company will receive additional funds under the Credit Agreement and will issue securities under the SPA in an amount equal to the applicable percentage, up to an aggregate of ownership limitation on a fully-diluted basis at such time the Delayed Draw Term Loan is fully drawn. Although these contingent warrants are not issued or exercisable until additional draws occur, they meet the definition of a derivative and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income.

 20. Earnings Per Share (cont.) 

 Stock options 
 
 Generally, basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.The Preferred Series B is a participating security that does not have the obligation to share in the losses of the Company. Therefore, the more dilutive of the if-converted and two-class method must be applied when calculating EPS for the common shares. Management has elected to recognize changes in the redemption value of the Series B Preferred Stock. At each balance sheet date, the redemption value of the Series B Preferred Stock will be calculated, and if the redemption value is greater than the carrying value, the carrying value will be accreted to the redemption value. The accretion is recorded as a deemed dividend, which, in the absence of Retained earnings, reduces additional paid in capital and earnings available to common shareholders in computing basic and diluted EPS. Other potentially dilutive common shares and the related impact to earnings are considered when calculating EPS on a diluted basis. 
 Since the Company incurred a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as well as the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the potential dilutive shares from stock options, restricted stock units, warrants, and convertible notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented. Therefore, basic and diluted EPS are computed using the same number of weighted-average shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as well as the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the financial statements and notes thereto. 
 
 Overview 
 The Company offers an innovative Znyth technology battery energy storage system ("BESS") designed to provide the operating flexibility to manage increased grid complexity and price volatility resulting from an overall increase in renewable energy generation and a congested grid coming from an increase in electricity demand growth. The Company s BESS is a validated chemistry with accessible non-precious earth components in a durable design that is intended to deliver results in even the most extreme temperatures and conditions. The system is designed to be safe, flexible, scalable, sustainable and manufactured in the United States using raw materials primarily sourced in the United States. We believe the Company s Z3 battery module is the core of its innovative systems. The Z3 battery module is the only US designed and manufactured battery module that today provide utilities, independent power producers, renewables developers and C I customers with an alternative to lithium-ion and lead-acid monopolar batteries for critical 3- to 12-hour discharge duration applications. We believe the Z3 battery will transform how utility, industrial and commercial customers store power. 
 In addition to its BESS, the Company currently offers: (a) a BMS which provides a remote asset monitoring capability and service to track the performance and health of the Company s BESS and to proactively identify future system performance issues through predictive analytics; (b) project management services to ensure the process of implementing the Company s BESS are coordinated in conjunction with the customer s overall project plans; (c) commissioning services that ensure the customer s installation of the BESS meets the performance expected by the customer; and (d) long-term maintenance plans to maintain optimal operating performance of the Company s systems . 
 The Company s growth strategy contemplates increasing sales of battery energy storage systems and related software and services through a direct sales team and sales channel partners. The Company s current and target customers include utilities, project developers, independent power producers and commercial and industrial companies. 
 
 Strategy 
 The Company continues to invest in the refinement and production of its Z3 battery, which builds off the same electrochemistry that has not fundamentally changed for the better part of a decade. The next Z3 battery is designed to reduce cost and weight while improving manufacturability and system performance. The Eos Z3 battery is more cost-effective and has a simpler tub design with 50 fewer cells and 98 fewer welds per battery module than the Gen 2.3. The Company currently expects that the Z3 battery will give customers the benefit of two times the energy density per square foot, along with the ability to cycle multiple times per day, all with the same safety, reliability, security and recyclability. The Z3 transition is fully underway and the first semi-automated battery manufacturing line is installed and has started commercial production. The Z3 batteries utilize the same chemistry, which has over 3 million cycles, and incorporate a new mechanical design aimed at improving performance, lowering cost and increasing manufacturability. 
 The Company started delivery of its Z3 battery modules in the third quarter of 2023. The Z3 battery incorporates valuable lessons learned from the past 15 years into a new system design which the Company expects to result in efficiencies as it develops its new state-of-the-art manufacturing line. 
 The Company believes the simplicity, flexibility and safety of our products are what the market desires. In addition, we believe that the Inflation Reduction Act gives us a competitive advantage by virtue of production tax credits PTC that can be claimed on battery components manufactured domestically, and tax credits for customers for projects that satisfy domestic content requirements. See Regulatory Landscape section . The Company intends to engage with a consortium of community leaders, universities and supply chain partners in anticipation of pursuing grants made available under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021.

 Regulatory Landscape 
 U.S. Department of Energy DOE 
 In August 2023, the DOE issued a Conditional Commitment Letter to the Company for a loan of an aggregate principal amount of up to 398.6 million through the DOE s Clean Energy Financing Program. The Conditional Commitment Letter follows an extensive technical, financial and commercial due diligence process by the DOE. If finalized, the loan is expected to fund 80 of eligible costs of the Company s planned manufacturing expansion in and around Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. 
 Eligible costs include capital expenditures and other costs associated with ramping up the manufacturing lines and facility, for example start-up and shakedown costs, as well as certain material and labor costs before efficiencies are met. The Company is working to finalize the loan documents with the DOE and to fulfill certain conditions precedent. Eos is spending eligible costs now that would be reimbursable at first funding. 
 Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA 
 The IRA features significant economic incentives for both energy storage customers and manufacturers for projects placed in service after December 31, 2022. One of the most important features of the IRA is that it offers a 10-year term tax credit, whereas historically similar industrial credits have been shorter in duration. Customers placing new energy storage facilities in service will be allowed to claim at least a thirty percent investment tax credit ITC under certain conditions. The IRA also offers an extra ten percent credit if the project is in an energy community and another ten percent credit if the project satisfies domestic content requirements, which will be set forth when the implementing regulations are finalized. The ten percent bonus for domestic content could represent a strategic advantage for the Company resulting from the Company s near-sourcing and Made in America strategy, and we currently anticipate that projects utilizing Eos batteries will qualify for the bonus. 
 As discussed in Note 11, Government Grants to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, starting in 2023, there are Production Tax Credits under Internal Revenue Code 45X PTC that can be claimed on battery components manufactured in the U.S. and sold to U.S. or foreign customers. These tax credits available to manufacturers include a credit for ten percent of the cost incurred to make electrode active materials in addition to credits of 35 per kWh of capacity of battery cells and 10 per kWh of capacity of battery modules. These credits are cumulative, meaning that companies will be able to claim each of the available tax credits based on the battery components produced and sold through 2029, after which the PTC will begin to gradually phase down through 2032. These credits are expected to be a new source of cash flow for Eos in the future. 
 
 Company Highlights 
 In January 2024, the Company entered into a supply agreement with TETRA Technologies, Inc TETRA that further expanded this partnership.

 Change Change Cost of goods sold 25,764 21,262 4,502 21 68,114 59,448 8,666 15 
 Cost of goods sold primarily consists of direct costs relating to labor, material and overhead directly tied to product assembly, procurement and construction EPC ), project delivery, commissioning and start-up test procedures. Indirect costs included in cost of goods sold are manufacturing overhead such as equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety, quality and production control procurement, transportation, logistics, depreciation and facility-related costs. As a nascent technology with a new manufacturing process that is early in its product lifecycle, the Company still faces significant costs associated with production start-up, commissioning of various components, modules and subsystems and other related costs. The Company expects its cost of goods sold to exceed revenues in the near term as it continues to scale production and prepares battery energy storage systems delivered to customers to go-live. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Cost of goods sold increased by 4.5 million or 21 from 21.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Cost of goods sold increased by 8.7 million or 15 from 59.4 million. 
 The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an inventory reserve adjustment in 2024 due to lower of cost or market LCM amounting to approximately 6.7 million, since the Company has negative gross margins for the period. 
 The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in project commissioning costs on previously delivered projects, revaluations of inventory balances, along with the underutilization and absorption of labor and overhead associated with implementing the new line.

 Liquidity and Going Concern 
 As a growth company in the early commercialization stage of its lifecycle, Eos is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the development of an enterprise. In this regard, substantially all of the Company s efforts to date have been devoted to the development and manufacturing of battery energy storage systems and complementary products and services, recruitment of management and technical staff, deployment of capital to expand the Company s operations to meet customer demand and raising capital to fund the Company s development. However, as a result of these efforts, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and expects to continue to incur such losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future until such time that the Company can reach a scale of profitability to sustain its operations. 
 In order to execute its development strategy, the Company has historically relied on outside capital through the issuance of equity, debt and borrowings under financing arrangements (collectively outside capital to fund its cost structure. While the Company believes its recent entry into new credit facilities as discussed below has significantly improved its capital position and provides a path to sustainable operations and profitability, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to achieve such profitability or do so in a manner that does not require additional outside capital. Moreover, while the Company has historically been successful in raising outside capital, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to obtain outside capital in the future or do so on terms that are acceptable to the Company, should it be needed. 
 As disclosed in Note 3, Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction, on June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a financing transaction with CCM Denali Debt Holdings, LP, an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management LP (herein after referred to as Cerberus , Denali , Lender , Holder ). As a result of this transaction, Cerberus agreed to provide a 210.5 million secured multi-draw facility to be made in four installments (the Delayed Draw Term Loan as well as a 105.0 million revolving credit facility Revolving Facility ), to be made available beginning June 21, 2026, at Cerberus sole discretion and only if the Delayed Draw Term Loan is fully funded. 
 As of the date the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were issued (the issuance date ), management evaluated the significance of the following negative financial conditions in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 205-40, Going Concern: 
 Since its inception, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash from operations in order to fund its development. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 417.7 million, incurred negative cash flows from operations of 111.3 million and had an accumulated deficit of 1,293.6 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 23.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available to fund the Company s operations and working capital of 74.1 million, which includes loan commitment assets of 58.5 million classified as current assets on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Additionally, the Company continues to progress through the Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office s (LPO) process for its Title XVII loan. In August 2023, the DOE issued a conditional commitment letter to the Company for a loan of an aggregate principal amount of up to 398.6 million through the DOE s Clean Energy Financing Program. Certain technical, legal and financial conditions must be met and due diligence to the satisfaction of the DOE must be completed before the DOE enters into definitive financing documents with the Company and funds the loan. The Company continues to work with the DOE to meet these conditions and close the loan, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure such a loan or on terms that are acceptable to the Company. 
 The Company is required to remain in compliance with certain quarterly financial covenants under its Credit Agreement. These financial covenants include, as defined in the Credit Agreement, (a) Minimum Consolidated EBITDA, (b) Minimum Consolidated Revenue, and (c) Minimum Liquidity (collectively, the financial covenants ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants and non-financial covenants, except for the September 30, 2024 Minimum Consolidated Revenue financial covenant. The Company secured a waiver of non-compliance from Cerberus for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company expects it may be unable to remain in compliance with the Minimum Consolidated Revenue financial covenant beginning December 31, 2024, absent the Company s ability to secure a waiver or amend the Credit Agreement. In the event the Company is unable to comply with the financial and the non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2024, and the Company is unable to secure another waiver, Cerberus may, at its discretion, enter into a forbearance agreement with the Company and/or exercise any and all of its existing rights and remedies, which may include, among other things, asserting its rights in the Company s assets securing the loan. Moreover, the Company s other lenders may exercise similar rights and remedies under the cross-default provisions of their respective borrowing arrangements with the Company.

 Cerberus funded the Company 30.0 million August Draw ), and the Company received 28.5 million, net of the 5.0 original issue discount, since the Company met the milestones for the August Draw as disclosed in Note 3, Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction. Subsequently, on November 1, 2024, Cerberus funded the Company 65 million related to the October 31, 2024 tranche October Draw or October Tranche ), and the Company received 61.75 million, which is net of the 5.0 original issue discount from the Delayed Draw Term Loan as disclosed in Note 21, Subsequent Events . In the event the Company does not achieve the remaining funding milestone, and Cerberus chooses not to continue funding, and the Company s ongoing efforts to raise additional outside capital prove unsuccessful, the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due over the next twelve months beyond the issuance date. In such an event, management will be required to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include, among others, a significant curtailment in the Company s operations, a sale of certain of the Company s assets, a sale of the entire Company to strategic or financial investors and/or allowing the Company to become insolvent. 
 These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates that the Company will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 The Company has historically relied on outside capital to fund its cost structure and expects this reliance to continue for the foreseeable future until the Company reaches profitability through its planned revenue generating activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company closed on the following capital transactions: 
 Under the ATM offering program, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 16,627,523 shares raising proceeds of 14.1 million, net of fees paid to Cowen, at an average selling price of 0.87 per share, included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Deficit. 
 The Company secured a strategic investment of up to 315.5 million from Cerberus. The investment by Cerberus is structured as a 210.5 million Delayed Draw Term Loan to be made in four installments. On June 21, 2024 the first installment of 75.0 million was funded, and on August 29, 2024, the second draw of 30.0 million was funded. Additional amounts totaling 105.5 million will be made available to the Company, subject to the achievement of certain milestones. As part of the strategic investment, a 105.0 Revolving Facility will be made available to the Company at the Lenders sole discretion and only if the Delayed Draw Term Loan is fully funded. 
 The Company retired its existing 100.0 million Senior Secured Term Loan on favorable terms, strengthening the Company s balance sheet. See Note 3, Credit and Securities Purchase Transaction. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The Company expects capital expenditures and working capital requirements to increase as it executes its growth strategy. Total capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 20.1 million and 21.2 million, respectively. See Note 7, Property, Plant and Equipment for further discussion.

 Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows 
 The Company relies heavily on private placement of convertible notes, term loans, equipment financing and issuance of common stock and warrants. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to funding of debt interest payments, repayment of debt principal, product manufacturing, research and development and general corporate expenses. The Company s long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations and capital expenses for capacity expansion and maintenance, equipment upgrades and repair of equipment.

 Critical Accounting Estimates CAE 
 The Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). In preparing the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management regularly reevaluates assumptions, judgments and estimates. The Company s significant accounting policies are described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 These should also be read with the CAE in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Warrants Liability 
 The April 2023 warrants, May 2023 warrants and December 2023 warrants all are valued using the Black-Scholes model at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. This model incorporates inputs such as the stock price of the Company, risk-free interest rate, volatility and time to expiration. The volatility is a significant unobservable input classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The sensitivity of the fair value calculation to volatility could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. See Note 15, Fair Value Measurement to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Convertible Notes and Embedded derivatives 
 The Company estimated the fair value of the embedded conversion features in the 2021 Convertible Note and the AFG Convertible Notes using a binomial lattice model at inception and on subsequent measurement dates. This model incorporates significant inputs such as the stock price of the Company, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, debt yield and expected volatility. The volatility and debt yield are significant unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The sensitivity of the fair value calculation to debt yield and volatility could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. See Note 15, Fair Value Measurement to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents 

 The following is a new CAE as of June 30, 2024. 
 New Instruments fair valued see Note 15, Fair Value Measurement) 
 The fair value of the Delayed Draw Term Loan was estimated using a discounted cash flow DCF method, based on the contractual cash flows discounted at a debt yield. The fair value for the SPA Warrant is estimated based on its intrinsic value, using the Eos common stock closing price adjusted by a discounted for lack of marketability DLOM ), less the exercise price of 0.01 for the SPA Warrant. A DLOM was applied considering the underlying shares of the SPA Warrants are unregistered. The fair value of the Contingent Warrants is estimated based on the underlying Eos common stock closing price adjusted by a DLOM and an allowance for certain redemption features using a Black-Scholes model, considering the probability of achieving certain milestones. A DLOM was applied considering the underlying shares of the Contingent Warrants are unregistered. The fair values for all these instruments are designated as level 3 measurements as they rely on significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs for each of these instruments are detailed in Note 15, Fair Value Measurement ), which include debt yield, DLOM, and milestones achievement expectations. The sensitivity of the fair value calculation to debt yield, DLOM, and milestones achievement expectations could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes in the Company s market risk exposures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to those discussed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation and consistent with the evaluations previously reported in prior periods, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 because of material weaknesses resulting from lack of a formalized internal control framework in accordance with the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) Framework, inadequate segregation of duties in the financial reporting process, lack of review and approval of journal entries and a lack of management review controls. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including its CEO and its CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In light of these material weaknesses, management performed additional analyses, reconciliations and other post-closing procedures to determine that the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Based on this review, management concluded that the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 Management s Remediation Plan and Status 
 Through September 30, 2024, our management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, has materially designed the necessary measures to remediate the control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses. These remediation efforts are detailed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 These remediation efforts include the following: 
 1. Engaged external experts to complement internal resources and to provide support related to more complex applications of GAAP, tax, and internal controls. We will continue to utilize outside resources, as necessary, to supplement our internal team. 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 2. We designed a comprehensive internal control framework that includes a formal risk assessment process to identify and design our control activities to address all risks of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud. We developed formalized process and control documentation for all relevant areas of financial reporting, including IT general and automated controls that support financial reporting. 
 3. We designed a comprehensive segregation of duties framework and identified the necessary mitigating controls to compensate any applicable risk, including restricting the ability for one individual to both (i) create and post a journal entry in the general ledger and (ii) prepare and review account reconciliations. 
 4. We designed management review controls over each significant class of transaction, including areas considered highly complex, judgmental, and subject to management estimation. We have designed procedures to validate underlying source data and used in our financial reporting controls and the necessary IT general and automated controls to rely on the IT environment supporting our financial reporting. 
 5. We designed controls to identify any significant and unusual transactions, analyze, record, report, and disclose such matters. 
 We continue to assess risks on a continuous basis to timely identify new exposures or risk categories as business practices change and, as applicable, update our existing internal control framework to ensure that it has identified, developed and deployed the appropriate business process controls to meet the objectives and address the risks identified. 
 We have substantially designed the controls necessary to remediate the material weaknesses; however, we have determined that all the controls necessary to remediate the material weaknesses have not operated for a sufficient period of time to fully conclude remediation as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Part II - Other information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of the Company s operations. While the outcomes of these types of claims are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 The following is also disclosed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements: 
 Class Action Complaints 
 On March 8, 2023, a class action lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by plaintiff Richard Delman against certain defendants including the Company s former directors (the Delman Defendants ). Neither the Company nor Eos Energy Storage LLC were named as a defendant but each was identified in the Complaint as a relevant non-party and the Company has indemnification obligations relating to the lawsuit. On February 1, 2024, the parties agreed to a binding Settlement Term Sheet (the Settlement whereby plaintiff agreed to resolve the lawsuit in exchange for a settlement payment of 8.5 million, to be fully funded by the Company s Directors and Officers D O liability insurance policies subject to a retention by the Company of approximately 1.0 million consisting of the Company s payment of legal fees related to this matter. On June 1, 2024, the parties submitted to the Court of Chancery a definitive Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise, and Release, and related documents. On October 17, 2024, the Court of Chancery approved the proposed Settlement and the Company coordinating the settlement payment with the Company s D O insurers. 
 On August 1, 2023, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court of New Jersey by plaintiff William Houck against the Company, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, its former Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Financial Officer (with the Company, the Houck Defendants ). The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making knowingly false or misleading statements about the Company s contractual relationship with a customer and about the size of the Company s order backlog and commercial pipeline. Defendants deny the allegations and, on February 13, 2024, moved to dismiss the Complaint. On March 5, 2024, plaintiff filed an amended complaint that dropped the Company s former Chief Financial Officer as a defendant. On April 4, 2024, defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against this action.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no additional material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except as discussed below. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 If we fail to meet the covenants in Credit Agreement, we may be subject to default on the loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company including, among others, as defined in the Credit Agreement (i) meeting certain Minimum Consolidated EBITDA, Minimum Consolidated Revenue, and Minimum Liquidity (the cash in accounts controlled by the Agent,) measured quarterly, (ii) reporting and information covenants including the delivery of annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements, daily cash reports, annual financial plans and forecasts with weekly progress reports and updates, (iii) monthly meetings with the Lenders and the engagement of advisors and consultants requested by the Lenders, and (iv) restrictions on business and activities including debt incurrence, asset dispositions, distributions, investments, and modifications to or terminations of various material contracts. The Credit Agreement is subject to certain events of default which can be triggered by, among other things, (i) breach of payment obligations and other obligations and representations in the Credit Agreement nor related documents, (ii) default under other debt facilities with a principal above a predetermined amount, (iii) failure to perform or comply with certain covenants in the Credit Agreement, (iv) entry into a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in an involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or under any other debtor relief law,(v) any money judgment, writ or warrant of attachment or similar process involving in the aggregate at any time an amount in excess of 2.5 million, (vi) any order, judgement or decree entered against the Company or the any of its subsidiaries decreeing the dissolution or split up of such entity, (vii) the failure of the Common Stock to be listed on an internationally recognized stock exchange in the United States and (viii) a change of control. 
 Since the Company was not in compliance with the financial covenant for Minimum Consolidated Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company secured a waiver from Cerberus. The Company expects it may be unable to remain in compliance with the Minimum Consolidated Revenue financial covenant beginning December 31, 2024, absent the Company s ability to secure a waiver or amend the Credit Agreement. In the event the Company is unable to comply with all financial covenants when required under the Credit Agreement, and the Company is unable to secure another waiver or amendment to the Credit Agreement, Cerberus may, at its discretion, exercise any and all of its existing rights and remedies, which may include, among other things, asserting its rights in the Company s assets securing the loan, and the Lenders may no longer be required to continue funding under the Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure funding under the Credit Agreement or outside sources of capital in the event it fails to meet a funding milestone. Moreover, the Company s other lenders may exercise similar rights and remedies under the cross-default provisions of their respective borrowing arrangements with the Company. Any such default on the Credit Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, current stockholders may be subject to significant dilution, and the voting power of the currently outstanding Common Stock could be significantly diluted. 
 As of November 1, 2024, there were 217,904,747 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and an aggregate of 242,556,689 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exercise of outstanding convertible securities, including 142,282,584 shares of Common Stock underlying the SPA Warrant and Series B Preferred Stock issued to Cerberus. 
 If the Purchaser funds all future draws under the Delayed Draw Term Loan and the Company meets each of the milestones under the Delayed Draw Term Loan, the Purchaser will be entitled to receive Series B Preferred Stock and/or Contingent Warrants that, when aggregated with the SPA Warrant and Series B Preferred Stock, equal 33.0 of the issued and outstanding Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. Assuming the Company issues no other securities after November 1, 2024, such Series B Preferred Stock, SPA Warrant and Contingent Warrants (such warrants, collectively, the Warrants would aggregate to an equivalent of 156,714,957 shares of Common Stock. If the Purchaser funds all draws under the Delayed Draw Term Loan and the Company fails to meet all of the remaining milestones under the Delayed Draw Term Loan, the Purchaser would be entitled to receive Preferred Stock and/or Contingent Warrants (depending on whether stockholder approval has been received) that, when aggregated with the SPA Warrant and Series B Preferred Stock, equal 41.0 of the issued and outstanding Common Stock on a fully diluted basis, assuming the Warrants and Series B Preferred stock were fully convertible into Common Stock. Assuming the Company issues no other securities after November 1, 2024, such Preferred Stock and Warrants would aggregate to an equivalent of 221,107,338 shares of Common Stock.

 In addition, if the Company were to issue additional shares of Common Stock or securities convertible or exercisable into Common Stock or trigger anti-dilution protection under the Preferred Stock and Warrants, the Preferred Stock and Warrants may become convertible or exercisable into additional shares of Common Stock. The issuance, pursuant to the terms of the Warrants and the Series B Preferred Stock, of Common Stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of all stockholders, could dilute the book value per share of the Common Stock and will increase the number of the Company s outstanding shares, and upon conversion or exercise would dilute the voting power of the Common Stock, which could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decrease. Depressed trading prices of our Common Stock could further impair our ability to raise sufficient capital to carry on our business. 
 The Company may need to seek alternative sources of capital, or risk its ability to continue operations, in the event it fails to meet a milestone under the terms of the Credit Agreement and the SPA. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and the SPA, the Purchaser is not required to provide funding under the Delayed Draw Term Loan in the event that the Company does not meet the necessary performance and funding milestones stipulated in the Credit Agreement. In the event the Company does not meet these milestones and the Purchaser chooses not to continue funding, the Company would need to seek alternative sources of capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If the Purchaser does not continue funding, and the Company s efforts to raise additional outside capital prove unsuccessful, management would be required to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include, among others, a significant curtailment in the Company s operations, a sale of certain of the Company s assets, a sale of the entire Company to strategic or financial investors and/or allowing the Company to become insolvent. 
 A substantial number of shares of the Company s Common Stock that are issuable upon the exercise or conversion of securities issuable under the Delayed Draw Term Loan and the SPA are subject to a contractual lockup. 
 Under the terms of the Delayed Draw Term Loan and the SPA, the holders of our securities issuable thereunder are subject to a contractual lockup that expires on June 21, 2025. The securities issuable under the Delayed Draw Term Loan and the SPA represent a substantial portion of our outstanding shares of Common Stock and, subject to stockholder approval and beneficial ownership limitations, have the potential to represent an even larger portion of our outstanding shares of common Stock, and we are obligated to register the resale of these shares of Common Stock by the holders. 
 Upon the effectiveness of the resale registration statement or otherwise in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act and after expiration or waiver of the lock-up, the holders may sell our Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which could have the effect of increasing the volatility in the trading price of our Common Stock or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock. 
 The resale, or expected or potential resale, of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our Common Stock and make it more difficult for you to sell your Common Stock at times and prices that you feel are appropriate. Furthermore, because there will be a large number of shares registered pursuant to the registration statement, selling holders could continue to offer the securities covered by the registration statement for a significant period of time, the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the adverse market and price pressures resulting from an offering pursuant to a registration statement may continue for an extended period of time. 
 Further, sales of our Common Stock upon expected expiration of resale restrictions could encourage short sales by market participants. Generally, short selling means selling a security, contract or commodity not owned by the seller. The seller is committed to eventually purchase the financial instrument previously sold. Short sales are used to capitalize on an expected decline in the security s price. As such, short sales of our Common Stock could have a tendency to depress the price of our Common Stock, which could further increase the potential for short sales. 
 We cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our Common Stock will have on the market price of our Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock, including issuances made in the ordinary course of the Company s business, or the perception that such sales could occur, may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Common Stock.
