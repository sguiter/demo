 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

shares of HCMC common stock held as of 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on September 9, 2024, the record date for the Spin-Off (the Record Date ), a HCMC stockholder was entitled
to receive one share of Class A common stock and three shares of Class B common stock. The Distribution was made in book-entry form by
a distribution agent as soon as practicable after the date of the Distribution. 

As
a result of the Spin-Off, the operating results for the HCWC business through the date of the Spin-Off are reported in Loss from Discontinued
Operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. In addition, the related assets and liabilities
are reported as Assets and Liabilities of Discontinued Operations on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for year ended December
31, 2023. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts and disclosures included in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect
only the Company s continuing operations. For additional information, see Note 2, Discontinued Operations. 

Segment
Reporting 

The
Company operates as a single segment that includes all of its continuing operations, which is designed to enable customers to purchase
its products through stores or digital channels. The Company previously had two reportable segments: Grocery and Vape. The Grocery segment
was spun-off on September 13, 2024 and is now reported as discontinued operations for all periods through that date. 

. HCWC is now an independent
public company listed under the symbol HCWC on the NYSEAM. The Company retained no ownership interest in HCWC
following the Separation. 

Cash
of million held by HCWC and its subsidiary were transferred to HCWC on the Distribution Date. HCMC and HCWC settled
intercompany balances in the amount of 
million on the Spin-Off date. 

During
the third quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a net reduction to retained earnings of million as a result of the Separation, primarily
related to the transfer of certain assets and liabilities associated with its grocery business to HCWC. 

In
connection with the Separation, the Company entered into several agreements with HCWC that govern the relationship of the parties following
the Spin-Off. These agreements include: 

a
 Separation Agreement that will set forth HCMC s and the Company s agreements regarding the principal actions that both
 parties will take in connection with the Spin-Off and aspects of our relationship following the Spin-Off; 

a
 Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which HCMC and the Company will provide each other specified services on a transitional
 basis to help ensure an orderly transition following the Spin-Off. 

a
 Tax Matters Agreement that will govern the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of HCMC and the Company after the
 Spin-Off with respect to all tax matters and will include restrictions to preserve the tax-free status of the Spin-Off; and 

an
 Employee Matters Agreement that will address employment, compensation and benefits matters, including the allocation and treatment
 of assets and liabilities arising out of employee compensation and benefits programs in which our employees participated prior to
 the Spin-Off. 

Under
the terms of the transition services agreement, HCMC will provide to HCWC, on a transitional basis, certain services or functions,
including information technology, accounting, human resources, and payroll functions. Generally, these services will be provided for
a period of up to one year following the Spin-Off. Consideration and costs for the transition services will be determined using several
billing methodologies as described in the agreements, including customary billing and pass-through billing. Costs for transition services
provided to HCWC are recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the nature of the services. Following the Spin-Off,
the Company recognized a reduction of costs of million for services provided to HCWC in the third quarter of 2024 pursuant to the
transition services agreement.

million and positive working capital of million. The Company s liquidity needs
through September 30, 2024 have been satisfied through financing agreement with private lenders. 

Management has made plans to reduce certain costs
and raise needed capital, however there can be no assurance the Company can successfully implement these plans. The success of these plans
is dependent upon various factors, foremost being the ability to reduce outside consulting expenses and the ability to secure additional
capital from outside investors. There can be no assurance that such plans will be successful. 

The
Company believes its cash on hand and its ability to draw on its million line of credit will enable the Company to meet its obligations
and capital requirements for at least the twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. Accordingly, no adjustment
has been made to the financial statements to account for this uncertainty.

Accounting Policies

have been no material changes in the Company s significant accounting policies to those previously disclosed in the 2023 Annual
Report.

Morris product known and marketed as IQOS . Philip Morris claims that it is currently approaching million users
of its IQOS product and has reportedly invested over billion in their smokeless tobacco products. On December 3, 2021, the District
Court for the Northern District of Georgia effectively dismissed HCMC s patent infringement action against Philip Morris USA, Inc.,
and Philip Morris Products S.A. On December 14, 2021, the Company filed an appeal of the District Court for the Northern District of

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The terms we, us, our, and the Company 
refer to Healthier Choices Management Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, HCMC Intellectual Property Holdings, LLC and The Vape
Store, Inc. Vape Store ). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

HCWC
Spin-Off 

On
September 13, 2024, HCMC completed the Spin-off of our Grocery business into an independent publicly traded company HCWC. As a result,
the operating results for the HCWC through the date of the Spin-off are reported in Loss from Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for all periods presented. In addition, the related assets and liabilities are reported as Assets and Liabilities
of Discontinued Operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Unless
otherwise noted, all amounts, percentages and discussion reflect only the results of operations and financial condition from our continuing
operations. 

Company
Overview 

Healthier
Choices Management Corp. is a holding company focused on monetizing its intellectual
property through royalty and licensing agreements, facilitated by its wholly owned subsidiary, HCMC Intellectual Property Holdings, LLC.
HCMC s IP portfolio includes patents related to innovative products, such as the Q-Cup and Imitine, which the company actively
markets. In addition, HCMC is engaged in legal actions against major companies like Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds for patent infringement. 

Through
its wholly owned subsidiary HCMC Intellectual Property Holdings, LLC, the Company manages and intends to expand on its intellectual property
portfolio. 

Additionally,
the Company markets its patented the Q-Cup technology under the vape segment; this patented technology is based on a small, quartz
cup called the Q-Cup , which a customer partially fills with either cannabis or CBD concentrate (approximately 50mg) purchased
from a third party. The Q-Cup is then inserted into the Q-Cup Tank or Globe, that heats the cup from the outside without
coming in direct contact with the solid concentrate. This Q-Cup technology provides significantly more efficiency and an on
the go solution for consumers who prefer to vape concentrates either medicinally or recreationally.

Liquidity 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in conformity with GAAP,
which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainties related to our going concern
assessment. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent
realizable or settlement values. The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of these uncertainties. 

The
Company currently and historically has reported net losses and cash outflows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had
cash and cash equivalent of approximately 2.5 million and positive working capital of 0.2 million. The Company s liquidity needs
through September 30, 2024 have been satisfied through financing agreement with private lenders. 

Management has made plans to reduce certain costs and raise needed capital, however there can be no assurance the
Company can successfully implement these plans. The success of these plans is dependent upon various factors, foremost being the ability
to reduce outside consulting expenses and the ability to secure additional capital from outside investors. There can be no assurance that
such plans will be successful. 

The
Company believes its cash on hand and its ability to draw on its 5 million line of credit will enable the Company to meet its obligations
and capital requirements for at least the twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. Accordingly, no adjustment
has been made to the financial statements to account for this uncertainty. 

Factors
Affecting Our Performance 

We
believe the following factors affect our performance: 

Pending
Patent : We have developed, trademarked and are preparing to commercialize additional products. We include product development
expenses as part of our operating expenses. In October 2018, we announced the granting of three US patents related to our Q-Cup 
technology. In addition, we have a suite of patent applications pending in the United States. There is no assurance that we will be awarded
patents for any of these pending patent applications. There is no assurance that we can monetize the patents. 

Manufacturing :
We have no manufacturing capabilities and do not intend to develop any manufacturing capabilities. Third party manufacturers make our
products to meet our design specifications. We depend on third party manufacturers for our vaporizer e-liquid and accessories. Our customers
associate certain characteristics of our products including the weight, feel, draw, unique flavor, packaging and other attributes of
our products to the brands we market, distribute and sell. Any interruption in supply and or consistency of our products may harm our
relationships and reputation with customers, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In order to minimize the risk of supply interruption, we currently utilize several third-party manufacturers to manufacture
our products to our specifications.

sales and cost of sales were de minimis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company closed all its brick-and-mortar
retail vape stores, as management had shifted its retail sales focus to the wholesale and online channel. The sales and cost of sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 continued to be significantly impacted by the inability to bring new products
to market via distribution.

Total
operating expenses increased 0.9 million to 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.4 million for the
same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to 1.2 million increase in stock compensation expense and 0.1 million increase in
payroll and benefit expense, offset by 0.5 million decrease in legal fees.

Our
net cash provided by operating activities of approximately 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from a net
loss of 5.9 million, offset by a non-cash adjustment of 3.6 million and a net cash change of 3.4 million from changes in operating
assets and liabilities. Our net cash used in operating activities of approximately 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 resulted from a net loss of 5.1 million, offset by a non-cash adjustment of 2.4 million and a net cash change of 0.4 million
from changes in operating assets and liabilities. 

The
net cash used in investing activities of 47,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from purchases of property and
equipment. The net cash provided by investing activities of 176,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted from collection
on a note receivable and purchases of property and equipment. 

The
net cash used in financing activities of 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to 4.1 million
net transfer to HCWC related to Spin-Off and 2.0 million cash proceeds from related party. Net cash used in financing activities of
approximately 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is due to Series E Preferred Stock redemption and exercise,
payment for deferred offering cost related with Spin-Off, and net parent investment. 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments with vendors
that are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on liquidity. 

Our
cash balances are kept liquid to support our growing acquisition and infrastructure needs for operational expansion. Most of our cash
and cash equivalent are concentrated in one financial institution and is generally in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The Company
has not experienced any losses on its cash. The following table presents the Company s cash position as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023.

The
Company reported a net loss from continuing operation of 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company also
had positive working capital of 0.2 million. The Company expects to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable
future. 

The
Company anticipates its current cash and its ability to draw from the 5 million credit line with private lender will be sufficient to
meet projected operating expenses for the foreseeable future through at least twelve months from the issuance of the consolidated financial
statements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to exercise considerable judgment with respect
to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and
liabilities, our recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

We
base our estimates on our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry, current and expected economic conditions,
the attributes of our products, the regulatory environment, and in certain cases, the results of outside appraisals. These estimates
include useful lives and impairment of long-lived assets, deferred taxes and related valuation allowances, allocation of corporate
general expenses, and the valuation of the assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. We periodically re-evaluate our
estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are
necessary. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. 

21 

While
we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we
cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment,
actual results could differ from such estimates. 

There
have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates except allocation of corporate general
expense as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in the 2023 Annual Report, which we believe are the most
critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that
we use in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Allocation of corporate general expenses to HCWC was a result of recently completed spin-Off of HCWC, which led to a reevaluation of how corporate general expenses were allocated. The Company adopted a proportional cost allocation method to allocate parent expense to the carve-out entity. 

Seasonality 

We
do not consider our business to be seasonal. 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
report includes forward-looking statements including statements regarding retail expansion, the future demand for our products, the transition
to vaporizer and other products, competition, the adequacy of our cash resources and our authorized Common Stock, and our continued ability
to raise capital. 

The
words believe, may, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, 
 should, plan, could, target, potential, is likely, 
 will, expect and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial
trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. 

The
results anticipated by any or all of these forward-looking statements might not occur. Important factors that could cause actual
results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include our future common stock price, customer acceptance of our
products, and proposed federal and state regulation. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as the result of new information, future events or otherwise.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We
are required to report under Section 404(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, did not carry out an evaluation on internal controls
as of September 30, 2024 in regard to the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. As an evaluation was not carried out, our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered
by this report. 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal control over financial reporting based on
the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (2013 framework). Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of September 30, 2024 and noted the material weaknesses
as follows: 

Failure
 to have properly documented and designed disclosure controls and procedures and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal
 control over financial reporting. 

22 

Segregation
 of duties due to lack of personnel. 

The
 Company had ineffective design, implementation and, operation of controls over logical access, program change management, and vendor
 management controls. The Company controls on IT should have included the following: 

Appropriate
 restrictions that would adequately prevent users from gaining inappropriate access to the financially relevant systems. 

IT
 program and data changes affecting the Company s financial IT applications and underlying accounting records, should be identified,
 tested, authorized and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT system(s) were complete and accurate. 

Obtaining
 and reviewing key third party service provider SOC reports. 

Our
management concluded that considering internal control deficiencies that, in the aggregate, rise to the level of material weaknesses,
we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on the criteria set forth in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

Planned
Remediation 

Management
continues to work to improve its controls related to our material weaknesses listed above. In order to achieve the timely implementation
of the above, management has commenced the following actions and will continue to assess additional opportunities for remediation on
an ongoing basis: 

Continuing
 to increase headcount across the Company, with a particular focus on hiring individuals with strong internal control backgrounds
 and inventory expertise. 

Establishing
 policies and procedures in the IT area to mitigate data breach, unauthorized access and address segregation of duties, as well as
 review key third party service provider SOC reports. 

We
are currently working to improve and simplify our internal processes and implement enhanced controls, as discussed above, to address
the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and to remedy the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures. These material weaknesses will not be considered to be remediated until the applicable remediated controls are operating
for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financing Reporting 

Except
as detailed above, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

There
were two lawsuits in connection with alleged claimed battery defects for an electronic cigarette device. One had been dismissed by the
court wherein the plaintiff settled with the Company s insurance carrier with no economic impact to the Company. In the second
lawsuit, as of December 31, 2023, the Company had reached an arrangement with the plaintiff to resolve the matter, limiting potential
exposure of the Company to 1.5 million which was reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses, representing management s
estimate of the probable settlement amount based on the current status of discussions. This arrangement was formalized by a signed agreement
on July 1, 2024 and the Company has accrued 1.5 million at June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company already paid 700,000,
and the remaining balance of 800,000 was reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheets. 

On
November 30, 2020, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Philip Morris Products S.A. in
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuit alleges infringement on HCMC-owned patent(s) by the Philip
Morris product known and marketed as IQOS . Philip Morris claims that it is currently approaching 14 million users
of its IQOS product and has reportedly invested over 3 billion in their smokeless tobacco products. On December 3, 2021, the District
Court for the Northern District of Georgia effectively dismissed HCMC s patent infringement action against Philip Morris USA, Inc.
and Philip Morris Products S.A. On December 14, 2021, the Company filed a notice of appeal of the District Court for the Northern District
of Georgia s dismissal of the Company s patent infringement action against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Philip Morris Products
S.A. The appeal brief was filed on February 28, 2022. 

In
connection with such dismissal, the defendants sought to recover attorney s fees from the Plaintiff. On February 22, 2022, the
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted the defendant s an award of approximately 575,000 in attorneys 
fees to be paid by the Company. HCMC appealed this ruling on June 22, 2022. 

On
April 12, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of HCMC on two separate appeals it had filed in its
patent infringement action against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Philip Morris Products S.A. pending in the district court for the Northern
District of Georgia. 

In
the first appeal, HCMC appealed the ruling of the District Court dismissing HCMC s patent infringement action and denying HCMC s
motion to amend its pleading. In the second appeal, HCMC appealed the District Court s award of attorneys fees to Philip
Morris. In its decisions, the Federal Circuit ruled for HCMC by reversing both of those decisions and remanded the case back to the District
Court for further proceedings. 

On
September 26, 2023, HCMC filed a patent infringement lawsuit against R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company RJR in the U.S. District
Court for the Middle District of North Carolina in connection with HCMC s assertions that RJR s Vuse electronic cigarette
infringes one of HCMC s patents. 

On November 17, 2023, RJR filed a motion to dismiss
the action. HCMC opposed on December 22, 2023. To date the court has not ruled on the motion. 

On September 18, 2024, RJR filed an inter partes review of the patent-in-suit at the United States Patent and Trademark
Office USPTO ). A decision on institution will be made by the USPTO sometime after January 2025. 

From
time to time the Company is involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that there is no
other litigation pending that is likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations as of September 30, 2024. With respect to legal costs, we record such costs as incurred.
