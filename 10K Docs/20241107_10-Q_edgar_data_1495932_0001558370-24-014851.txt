 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains statements that are not historical fact and may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but rather represent current expectations and assumptions of future events. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many of these risks and other factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, project, plan, should, intend, may, will, could, can, would, potential, seek, goal and similar expressions of the future. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations, including, but not limited to: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the strength of the residential real estate market; the impact of monetary policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies on our operations; the impact of changes in consumer attitudes on home sale transaction volume; the impact of excessive or insufficient home inventory supply on home sale transaction value; our ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel; changes in tax laws and regulations that may have a material adverse effect on our business; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; the impact of security breaches, interruptions, delays and failures in our systems and operations on our business; financial condition and reputation; our ability to predict the demand or growth of our new products and services; our ability to maintain our agent growth rate; 
 the impact of adverse outcomes in litigation and regulatory actions against us and other companies and agents in our industry on our business, including the outcome of any proposed settlements related to those actions; and 
 the effect of inflation and continuing high interest rates on real estate transaction values and our operating results, profits and cash flows. 
 Other factors not identified above, including those described under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ), may also cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are difficult to anticipate and are generally beyond our control. You should consider these factors in connection with considering any forward-looking statements that may be made by us. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available operating, financial and market information and are inherently uncertain. Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

(the Company was incorporated in Delaware on July 30, 2008 and launched the first cloud-based real estate brokerage offering agent-centric commission structure, revenue sharing, and agent equity opportunities in 2009. Today, the Company operates a diversified portfolio of service-based businesses whose operations benefit substantially from utilizing our enabling technology platform. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from

Table of Contents 
 commissions received by our residential real estate brokerages which provide a full suite of brokerage and adjacent services (such as mortgage, title, and content creation) to our real estate agents and brokers. Our residential real estate agents and brokers affiliate their real estate licenses with us and operate their businesses utilizing our cloud-based technology platform to enhance their real estate business and optimize efficiencies. Our enabling and innovative technology platform is a robust suite of cloud-based applications and software services tailored for our real estate agents and brokers and targets business operations such as customer relationship management, marketing, client services, and brokerage functionalities. We succeed when our real estate professionals succeed and we remain focused on being the most agent-centric business on the planet. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, following the discontinuation of Virbela, eXp manages its operations in three operating business segments: North American Realty; International Realty; and Other Affiliated Services. While we do not consider acquisitions a critical element of our ongoing business, we seek opportunities to expand and enhance our portfolio of solutions and believe we are well-positioned to capture additional revenue from such solutions. Discontinued Operations In the first quarter of 2024, we determined that there had been a significant change to the Virbela business model. We have begun the process of winding down the Virbela business, which includes closing out current contracts and reducing our external customers. Further, the technology is being replaced with Virbela Frame technology that will be initially utilized internally within the Company. We expect the process to wind down the Virbela business to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result of this change, the Company has determined that Virbela qualifies for reporting as discontinued operations and will be reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheet and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Prior year segment and financial statement information has been reclassified to reflect Virbela as discontinued operations. See Note 3 Discontinued Operations to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the discontinuation of Virbela. Strategy Our strategy is to grow organically in North America and certain international markets by increasing our independent agent and broker network. Through our cloud-based operations and technology platform, we strive to achieve customer-focused efficiencies that allow us to increase market share and attain strong returns as we scale our business within the markets in which we operate. By building partnerships and strategically deploying capital, we seek to grow the business and enter attractive verticals and adjacent markets. The Company s primary emphasis is on achieving operational excellence for our real estate agents, which we monitor using the aNPS. We remain focused on optimizing our operating costs to match our revenue trends. One critical area of capital deployment during the third quarter of 2024 remained our Sustainable Revenue Share Plan (the Revenue Share Plan ), whereby we pay real estate professionals affiliated with the Company a portion of eXp Realty s commission for their contribution to Company growth. Regular evaluations are conducted to ensure the plan s continued alignment with the Company's overarching objectives and for regulatory compliance. MARKET CONDITIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS Our business is dependent on the levels of home sales transactions and prices, which can vary based on economic conditions within the markets for which we operate. Changes in these conditions can have a positive or negative impact on our business. The economic conditions influencing housing markets primarily include economic growth, interest rates, unemployment, consumer confidence, mortgage availability and supply and demand. In periods of economic growth, rising consumer confidence and lower interest rates, demand typically increases resulting in higher home sales transactions and home sales prices. Conversely, in periods of economic recession, declining consumer confidence and higher interest rates, demand typically decreases, resulting in lower home sales transactions and home sale prices. Additionally, regulations imposed by local, state and federal government agencies and geopolitical instability can also negatively impact the housing markets in which we operate. Over the last several quarters, several macroeconomic conditions have been contributing to the slowdown in the U.S. residential real estate market, which directly impacts our business and financial results. These conditions include, but are not limited to rising inflation, continued higher than average mortgage interest rates, volatility in the U.S. equity markets and continued unrest around the world. In April 2019, the National Association of REALTORS NAR and certain brokerages and franchisors were named as defendants in a class action complaint alleging a conspiracy to violate federal antitrust laws by, among other things, requiring 

 20 

Table of Contents 
 residential property sellers in Missouri to pay inflated commission fees to buyer brokers (the NAR Class Action ). The Company was named as one of several defendants in similar class action suits, and has since entered into a settlement term sheet with plaintiffs in the Hooper Action, as discussed further in Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to these unaudited consolidated financial statements. In March 2024, NAR entered a settlement agreement to resolve on a class wide basis the claims against NAR in the NAR Class Action (the NAR Settlement ). In addition to a monetary payment, NAR agreed to change certain business practices, including changes to cooperative compensation and buyer agreements, which business practice changes went into effect on August 17, 2024. eXp is empowering its agents in light of the NAR Settlement by offering comprehensive training sessions focused on compliance and best practices, addressing the clarifications in commission transparency and buyer representation agreements, providing resources such as buyer-representation agreement forms, and providing trainings to agents so that they understand the new guidelines and can integrate them into their operations. The Company believes it is well positioned to grow its market share in the current market conditions. We have a strong base of agent support, which should drive organic market share growth, retention and productivity. Additionally, we offer agents a low-cost, high-engagement model, which affords agents and brokers increased income and ownership opportunities while offering a scalable solution to brokerage owners who want to survive and thrive during market fluctuations. We have an efficient operating model with lower fixed costs driven by our cloud-based model, with no brick-and-mortar locations. National Housing Inventory During the third quarter of 2024, the continued higher mortgage rates and higher home prices have contributed to a rise in inventory levels, as measured in months of supply. According to NAR, inventory of existing homes for sale in the U.S. was 1.39 million as of September 2024 (preliminary) compared to 1.13 million at the end of September 2023. This represents 4.3 months of inventory in 2024 compared to 3.4 months of inventory in the prior year. Mortgage Interest Rates While mortgage rates continue to be higher than historic averages and negatively impact the demand for homebuying, mortgage rates during the third quarter of 2024 declined from the prior year. Based on Freddie Mac data, the average rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed rate mortgage was 6.08 in September 2024 compared to 7.3 in September 2023. Housing Affordability Index According to NAR, the composite housing affordability index increased to 98.6 for August 2024 (preliminary) from 91.1 for August 2023. When the index is above 100, it indicates that a family earning the median income has sufficient income to purchase a median-priced home, assuming a 20 down payment and ability to qualify for a mortgage. The housing affordability index has been declining year over year due to mortgage rate conditions and higher average home prices driven by constrained inventory levels. Existing Home Sales Transactions and Prices According to NAR, existing home sale transactions decreased to an annual rate of 3.84 million in September 2024 (preliminary) compared to 3.98 million in September 2023, a decrease of 3.5 . According to NAR, the nationwide existing home sales average price for September 2024 (preliminary) was 404,500 compared to 392,700 in September 2023, an increase of 3.0 . The declining home sales transactions in the U.S. have negatively impacted our transaction metrics, and increased home sales prices have positively impacted our sales volume metrics. Legal Regulatory Environment See Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of the current legal environment and how such environment could potentially impact our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

 KEY BUSINESS METRICS Management uses our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and key business metrics related to our business and industry to evaluate our performance and make strategic decisions. The following table outlines the key business metrics that we periodically review to track the Company s performance: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, except transactions and agent count) Performance: Agent NPS 76 74 75 72 Agent count 85,249 89,156 85,249 89,156 Real estate sales transactions 117,830 118,626 330,223 325,004 Real estate sales volume 50,798,695 48,526,164 139,869,084 130,337,913 Other real estate transactions 22,950 20,854 64,851 53,980 Real estate per transaction cost 494 497 536 541 Revenues 1,231,187 1,212,793 3,469,485 3,292,362 Operating (loss) profit 8,334) 3,705 7,971) 16,544 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 23,942 20,792 67,797 62,263 (1) Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. and should not be considered as an alternative to net (loss) income from continuing operations, operating (loss) income, or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income from continuing operations, see Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures . 
 Revenue and adjusted EBITDA are key financial measures, and we review these measures to evaluate and drive our core operating performance. Agent net promoter score (aNPS) aNPS is a scale-based measure of customer satisfaction and an aNPS above 50 is considered excellent. aNPS plays a crucial role in attracting and retaining agents and teams, especially during a period marked by market contraction, due to lower transaction volumes and higher mortgage rates. Despite the challenging market conditions, the Company s aNPS was 76 and 75 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively compared to 74 and 72 for the same periods of 2023, respectively, due to our continuous investment in agent onboarding, expert care, transaction processing and technology. Agent count One of our key strengths is attracting real estate agent and broker professionals that contribute to our growth. The rate of growth of our agent and broker base is difficult to predict and is subject to many factors outside of our control, including actions taken by our competitors and macroeconomic factors affecting the real estate industry in general including interest rates, declining transaction volume in the U.S., and industry practice changes in light of the NAR Settlement. The number of agents declined (4) in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, as we continue to off board less productive agents. However, we are committed to retaining our most productive agents in the United States and Canada through the execution of our growth strategies and the end-to-end suite of services we offer our agents. Real estate sales transactions and volume Real estate sales transactions are based on the side (buyer or seller) of each real estate transaction and are recorded when our agents and brokers represent buyers or sellers in the purchase or sale, respectively, of a home. The number of real estate transactions is a key driver of our revenue and profitability. Transaction volume represents the total sales value for all transactions and is influenced by several market factors, including, but not limited to, the pricing and quality of our services and market conditions that affect home sales, such as macroeconomic factors, economic growth, local inventory levels, mortgage interest rates, and seasonality. Our real estate sales transactions and volume typically fluctuate with changes in the market s existing home sales transactions as reported by NAR; however, company-specific initiatives influence the transaction volume and productivity of our agents. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023, our real estate sales transactions decreased (1) and increased 2 , respectively, due to our agents improved productivity, and international growth, which more than offset the decline in existing home sales in the U.S. as reported by the NAR. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023, transaction volume increased 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 5 and 7 , respectively, due to increased transactions for the nine-month period and increased home sale prices for both periods in 2024. Other real estate transactions Other real estate transactions are recorded for leases, rentals and referrals that are undertaken by our agents and brokers. The increase in other real estate transactions reflects the productivity of our agents and brokers. Real estate per transaction cost Real estate per transaction cost is measured as selling, general and administrative, sales and marketing and technology and development expenses resulting from our services that directly support our agents and brokers, divided by total transactions (real estate and other). Real estate per transaction cost decreased (1) for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower costs attributable to cost containment initiatives, partially offset by legal expenses related to the antitrust lawsuits. Revenues Revenues represent the commission revenue earned by the Company for closed brokerage real estate transactions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to same periods of 2023, the Company s revenue increased primarily due to higher home sales prices in both periods and in the nine-month period, increased real estate transactions driven by improved agent productivity and increased international production in previously launched markets. Operating (Loss) Profit The operating (loss) in the third quarter of 2024 of 8.3) million includes 18.0 million additional litigation contingency accrual recorded in the third quarter of 2024, compared to operating profit of 3.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The third quarter of 2024 reflects increased revenues, net of agent commissions and other agent-related costs, and lower operating costs in 2024, offset by increased legal expenses related to the antitrust lawsuits. The operating (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 8.0) million includes 34.0 million litigation contingency accrual, compared to operating profit of 16.5 million in the same period of 2023, reflecting increased legal expenses related to the antitrust lawsuits, and increased severance and employee-related expenses, partially offset by increased revenues, net of agent commissions and other agent-related costs. Adjusted EBITDA Management reviews Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.9 million compared to 20.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in adjusted EBITDA reflects increased revenues, net of agent commissions and other agent-related costs, and lower operating costs, partially offset by legal expenses related to the antitrust lawsuits. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 67.8 million compared to 62.3 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in adjusted EBITDA reflects increased revenues, net of agent commissions and other agent-related costs, partially offset by legal expenses related to the antitrust lawsuits, as well as increased severance and employee-related expenses.

 (1) Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net (loss) income from continuing operations, operating income, or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of such measures to operating (loss) profit from continuing operations and net (loss) income from continuing operations, respectively, see Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures . Management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon revenue and Adjusted Segment EBITDA. Adjusted Segment EBITDA is defined by us as operating (loss) profit from continuing operations plus depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by us as net (loss) income from continuing operations, excluding other income (expense), income tax benefit (expense), depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, litigation contingency expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and stock option expense and other items that are not core to the operating activities of the Company. The Company s presentation of Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 
 North American Realty revenues increased 1 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increased home sales prices, despite the challenging market in the U.S. residential real estate markets. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6 due to improved business efficiencies and reduced costs. International Realty revenues increased 63 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increased real estate transactions driven by improved agent production in previously launched markets. Adjusted EBITDA improved 37 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to increased revenue and improved business efficiencies and reduced costs. Other Affiliated Services revenues increased 46 due to Virbela Frame revenue, which more than offset lower SUCCESS revenues. Adjusted EBITDA decreased (40) due to increased costs partially offset by increased revenues. Corporate expenses and other contain the costs incurred to operate the corporate parent of eXp Realty.

Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended Change 2024 vs. 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (In thousands) Statement of Operations Data: Revenues North American Realty 3,408,418 3,254,666 153,752 5 International Realty 60,142 37,644 22,498 60 Other Affiliated Services 4,681 3,729 952 26 Segment eliminations (3,756) (3,677) (79) (2) Total Consolidated Revenues 3,469,485 3,292,362 177,123 5 Adjusted Segment EBITDA (1) North American Realty 85,208 82,495 2,713 3 International Realty (7,401) (10,105) 2,704 27 Other Affiliated Services (3,037) (2,767) (270) (10) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA 74,770 69,623 5,147 7 Corporate expenses and other (6,973) (7,360) 387 5 Total Reported Adjusted EBITDA 67,797 62,263 5,534 9 
 (1) Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net (loss) income from continuing operations, operating income, or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of such measures to operating profit and net (loss) income from continuing operations, respectively, see Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures . Management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon revenue and Adjusted Segment EBITDA. Adjusted Segment EBITDA is defined by us as operating (loss) profit from continuing operations plus depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by us as net (loss) income from continuing operations, excluding other income (expense), income tax benefit (expense), depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, litigation contingency expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and stock option expense and other items that are not core to the operating activities of the Company. The Company s presentation of Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 
 North American Realty revenues increased 5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increased real estate transactions and increased home sales prices, despite the challenging market in the U.S. residential real estate markets. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3 due to increased revenues, net of agent commissions and other agent-related costs, partially offset by increased legal expenses, increased severance and employee-related expenses. International Realty revenues increased 60 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increased real estate transactions driven by improved agent production in previously launched markets. Adjusted EBITDA improved 27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to increased revenue and improved business efficiencies and reduced costs. Other Affiliated Services revenues increased 26 due to Virbela Frame revenue, which more than offset lower SUCCESS revenues. Adjusted EBITDA decreased (10) due to increases in selling, general and administrative expenses related to investing in business initiatives, partially offset by increased revenues. Corporate expenses and other contain the costs incurred to operate the corporate parent of eXp Realty. NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, is presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S.GAAP. We define the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to mean net (loss) income from continuing operations, excluding other income (expense), income tax benefit (expense), depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, litigation contingency expenses, stock-based compensation expense and stock option expense. Adjusted Segment EBITDA is defined as operating profit (loss) from continuing operations plus depreciation and

 amortization and stock-based compensation expenses. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA provides useful information about our financial performance, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater transparency with respect to a key metric used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We believe that Adjusted Segment EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that otherwise could be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in Adjusted Segment EBITDA. In particular, we believe the exclusion of stock and stock option expenses, provides a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our underlying operations and provides better transparency into our results of operations. We are presenting the non-U.S. GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe this measure provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA compared to net (loss) income from continuing operations, the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Some of these limitations are that: Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense related to our agent growth incentive program and stock option expense, which have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, significant recurring expenses in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; and Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges such as depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangible assets, and impairment charges related to these long-lived assets, and, although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, amortized, or impaired may have to be replaced in the future. 
 The following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income from continuing operations, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net (loss) income from continuing operations 6,481) 2,265 8,545) 15,614 Total other (income) expense, net (520) (348) (2,934) (2,032) Income tax (benefit) expense (1,333) 1,788 3,508 2,962 Depreciation and amortization 2,379 2,790 7,742 8,148 Litigation contingency 18,000 - 34,000 - Stock compensation expense (1) 9,910 11,764 28,067 29,912 Stock option expense 1,987 2,533 5,959 7,659 Adjusted EBITDA 23,942 20,792 67,797 62,263 
 (1) This includes agent growth incentive stock compensation expense and stock compensation expense related to business acquisitions. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows generated from our business operations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, and meet obligations as they become due. Our cash and cash equivalents balances and cash flows from operations have strengthened primarily due to transaction volume growth and improved cost leverage over the prior five years, attributable to the expansion of our independent agent and broker network and, to a lesser extent, increased average prices of home sales. Currently, our primary use of cash on hand is to sustain and grow our business operations, including, but not limited to, commission and revenue share payments to agents and brokers and cash outflows for operating expenses and dividend payments. In addition, except for the 34 million litigation contingency accrual, the Company has no known material cash requirements as of September 30, 2024, relating to capital expenditures, commitments, or human capital (except as passthrough commissions to agents and brokers concurrent with settled real estate transactions). The Company intends to use available cash to pay the 34 million antitrust litigation Settlement amount. We believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and cash flows expected to be generated from our operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our level of investment in technology, our rate of growth into new markets, and cash used to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock. Our capital requirements may be affected 

 30 

Table of Contents 
 by factors which we cannot control such as the changes in the residential real estate market, interest rates, industry practice changes in light of the NAR Settlement, and other monetary and fiscal policy changes to the manner in which we currently operate. In order to support and achieve our future growth plans, we may need or seek advantageously to obtain additional funding through equity or debt financing. We believe that our current operating structure will facilitate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our expected long-term liquidity requirements beyond the next twelve months. Net Working Capital Net working capital is calculated as the Company s total current assets less its total current liabilities. The following table presents our net working capital as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Current assets 309,585 266,475 Current liabilities (221,532) (141,640) Net working capital 88,053 124,835 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net working capital decreased 36.8) million, or (29) , compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to increased accrued liabilities and accounts receivable, due to the increased revenues in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Cash Flows The following table presents our cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 177,800 176,516 Net cash used in investment activities (12,959) (11,318) Net cash used in financing activities (138,370) (150,843) Effect of changes in exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (624) 403 Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 25,847 14,758 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities increased 1.3 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in operating activities was primarily driven by improved operating results, increased customer deposits, lower agent equity stock compensation expense and favorable working capital changes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities relates to cash used for purchases of property and equipment, acquisition of new business, and investments in affiliates and increased modestly compared to the same period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 net cash flows used in financing activities decreased 12.5 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by lower stock repurchases. Acquisitions While we do not consider acquisitions a critical element of our ongoing business, we seek opportunities to expand and enhance our portfolio of solutions, access new revenue streams, or otherwise complement or accelerate the growth of our existing operations . We may fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses with various sources of capital including existing cash balances and cash flow from operations. Acquisitions during the first nine months of 2024 have not had a material impact on cash flow. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Annual Report, which provides a description of our critical accounting policies. There were no changes to critical accounting policies or estimates as reflected in our 2023 Annual Report. For additional information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of MD A included in our 2023 Annual Report.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes in our exposures to market risk since December 31, 2023. For details on the Company's interest rate and foreign currency exchange, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Information About Market Risks in our 2023 Annual Report. Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (as the principal executive officer) and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was conducted by the Company under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer each concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably believed to be likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS See Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies and Note 13 Subsequent Events to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for additional information regarding the Company s legal proceedings, which is incorporated herein by reference. We cannot provide any assurances that results of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Litigation and other legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial uncertainties and adverse resolutions could occur. In addition, litigation and other legal matters, including class action lawsuits, government investigations and regulatory proceedings can be costly to defend and, depending on the class size and claims, could be costly to settle. As such, the Company could incur judgments, penalties, sanctions, fines or enter into settlements of claims with liability that are materially in excess of amounts accrued and these settlements could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of risks, whether currently known or unknown. For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, please see in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of the 2023 Annual Report. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. Except for the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of 2023 Annual Report, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report, the risk factor related to legal and regulatory matters and the modified risk factor related to our stock set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors as disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report. Modifications to the risk factors below are designated by underlined text and removals are designated by stricken text.

 Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters Adverse outcomes in litigation and regulatory actions against other companies and agents in our industry could adversely impact our financial results. Adverse outcomes in legal and regulatory actions against other companies, brokers, and agents in the residential and commercial real estate industry may adversely impact the financial condition of the Company and our real estate brokers and agents when those matters relate to business practices shared by the Company, our real estate brokers and agents, or our industry at large. Such matters may include, without limitation, RESPA, Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and state consumer protection law, antitrust and anticompetition, and worker classification claims. Additionally, if plaintiffs or regulatory bodies are successful in such actions, this may increase the likelihood that similar claims are made against the Company and/or our real estate brokers and agents which claims could result in significant liability and be adverse to our financial results if we or our brokers and agents are unable to distinguish or defend our business practices. As an example, in the matter of Burnett v. National Association of Realtors (U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri), a federal jury found NAR and certain other remaining brokerage defendants liable for 1.8 billion in damages related to allegations of breach of federal and state antitrust laws, which matter remains subject to final court approval. Additionally, certain other brokerage defendants settled with the plaintiffs, including both monetary and non-monetary settlement terms, which also remain subject to final court approval. Since that time, the Company has been named in multiple putative class action complaints; all defendants have since settled (some of which remain subject to final court approval). That same day, the Company, along with other brokerage and non-brokerage defendants, were named as defendants in Gibson v. National Association of Realtors , alleging a similar fact pattern and antitrust violations. Since that time, the Company was named as a defendant in additional putative class action lawsuits alleging similar fact patterns and antitrust violations. NAR and certain brokerage defendants have settled certain of these lawsuits, which include both monetary and non-monetary settlement terms. On October 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Settlement Term Sheet (the Settlement with plaintiffs in the U.S. antitrust litigation filed by plaintiffs 1925 Hooper LLC and others in the Northern District of Georgia (the Hooper Action ). The Company expects that the proposed Settlement would resolve all U.S. claims set forth in the Hooper Action, as well as all similar claims on a nationwide basis against the Company (collectively, the Nationwide Claims and would release the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their independent contractor real estate agents in the United States from the Nationwide Claims. By the terms of the Settlement, the Company agreed to make certain changes to its business practices and to pay a total settlement amount of 34.0 million. The Settlement remains subject to preliminary and final court approval and will become effective following any appeals process, if applicable. Both the NAR and the Company s settlement terms may materially impact business practices within the industry which could adversely impact the Company s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Risks Related to our Real Estate Business The real estate market may be severely impacted by industry changes as the result of certain class action lawsuits, settlements, or government investigations. The real estate industry faces significant pressure from private lawsuits and investigations by the Departm ent of Justice (the DOJ into antitrust issues. In April 2019, the National Association of REALTORS NAR and certain brokerages and franchisors (including Realogy Holdings Corp., HomeServices of America, Inc. RE/MAX, and Keller Williams Realty, Inc.) were named as defendants in a class action complaint alleging a conspiracy to violate federal antitrust laws by, among other things, requiring residential property sellers in Missouri to pay inflated commission fees to buyer brokers (the NAR Class Action ). On October 31, 2023, a jury found NAR and various of its co-defendants liable and awarded plaintiffs nearly 1.8 billion in damages (all defendants have since settled, some of which remain subject to final court approval). Class action suits raising similar claims are already pending in this and other jurisdictions and the outcome of the NAR Class Action may result in additional such actions being filed. The Company was named as one of several defendants in similar class action suits, but entered into a settlement term sheet on October 1, 2024 to resolve all U.S. Nationwide Claims. See, Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies and Note 13 Subsequent Events to these unaudited consolidated financial statements . Defending against class action litigation is costly, may divert time and money away from our operations, and imposes a significant burden on management and employees. Also, the results of any such litigation or investigation cannot be

 predicted with certainty, and any negative outcome could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, and/or undesirable changes to our operations or business practices, and accordingly, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. On March 15, 2024, NAR entered a settlement agreement to resolve on a class wide basis the claims against NAR in the NAR Class Action. In addition to a monetary payment of 418 million, NAR agreed to change certain business practices, including changes to cooperative compensation and buyer agreements. The NAR settlement agreement: (1) prohibits NAR and REALTOR MLSs from requiring that listing brokers or sellers make offers of compensation to buyer brokers or other buyer representatives; (2) prohibits NAR, REALTOR MLSs and MLS participants from making an offer of compensation on the MLS; and (3) requires all REALTOR MLS participants to enter into a written buyer agreement specifying compensation before taking a buyer on tour. The NAR settlement received preliminary court approval on April 23, 2024. These revised NAR rules and practices have caused and may require additional changes to our business model, including changes to agent and broker compensation and how we meet home buyers. Without mandated commission sharing, for example, we may see the introduction of hourly or a la carte services. Or, if buyers now compensate brokers, they may be more likely to contact listing agents directly, which could drive down dual agent broker commissions. Home lending rules and norms do not currently allow buyers to include buyer s agent compensation in the balance of a home loan, which may impair the ability of homebuyers to pay their agent fees when purchasing a home. The amended rules and regulations also require us to get a buyer agreement signed before we take a home buyer on a first tour. This requirement may dissuade buyers from hiring the Company, thereby reducing the fees we receive from our agents. These and other shifts in the model for agent and broker compensation could significantly change the brokerage landscape overall and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the NAR Class Action and various similar private actions already pending, beginning in 2018, the DOJ began investigating NAR for violations of the federal antitrust laws. The DOJ and NAR appeared to reach a resolution in November 2020, resulting in the filing of a Complaint and Proposed Consent Judgment pursuant to which NAR agreed to adopt certain rule changes, such as increased disclosure of commission offers. The DOJ has since sought to continue its investigation of NAR, and on April 5, 2024 a federal appeals court decided that the DOJ could reopen its investigation. It is uncertain what effect, if any, the resumption of the DOJ s investigation could have on the larger real estate industry, including any further settlement that may result therefrom. Risks Related to Our Stock Because we can issue additional shares of common stock and because we issue stock under equity incentive plan s , our stockholders may experience dilution in the future. We are authorized to issue up to 900,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 183,606,708 shares were issued and 154,669,037 shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company maintains a 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and a 2024 Equity Incentive Plan from which employees, agents, brokers and certain service providers of the Company and its affiliates can receive awards of the Company s common stock. As of December 31 September 30 , 2024, no additional issuances were being made out of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan.. As of September 30, 2024, there were 150,000,000 shares authorized and 36,000,000 shares registered under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, of which 147,766,310 are available for future issuance, subject to registration. The Company ceased issuing shares under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. when it switched to issuing shares under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan on September 1, 2024. Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock without consent of any of our stockholders, subject to applicable Nasdaq listing rules. Consequently, current stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our common stock in the future.
