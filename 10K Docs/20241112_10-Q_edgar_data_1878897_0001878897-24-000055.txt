per annum payable in cash, or, at the Company s election, per annum paid in kind, due semi-annually. The maturity date of the Convertible Notes is July 2, 2029. 
 
 The Purchasers have the right to elect at any time to convert the Convertible Notes into shares of the Company s common stock at an initial conversion price equal to per share of common stock, so long as the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by such Purchaser (together with its affiliates) would not exceed (the Beneficial Ownership Limitation of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the conversion, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Note. The Purchasers have the right to increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation upon no less than days prior written notice to the Company, provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation may in no event exceed of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the conversion. The initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes represents a premium of approximately to the last reported sale price of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on July 1, 2024. The conversion price will be subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. Assuming the Convertible Notes are converted in full (without issuance of any make-whole shares), and based on the current number of shares of common stock outstanding, the Purchasers would beneficially own approximately of the shares of common stock outstanding on an as-converted basis. 
 
 The Convertible Notes are senior secured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by certain of the Company s direct and indirect subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors and secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to customary exceptions. 
 
 On or after July 2, 2027, the Company will have the right to redeem up to one-third of the initial outstanding principal and capitalized interest of the Convertible Notes (the Redemption Amount in cash if the last reported sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) in a -day trading period. On or after January 2, 2028, the Company will have the right to redeem the Redemption Amount in cash if the last reported sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) in a -day trading period. On or after July 2, 2028, the Company will have the right to redeem the Redemption Amount in cash if the last reported sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) in a -day trading period. The Company may not redeem more than the Redemption Amount in any rolling six-month period after July 2, 2027. In each case, such optional redemption would entitle the holder of the Convertible Notes to convert into shares of common stock calculated pursuant to a customary make-whole table prior to the applicable redemption date. 
 
 In the event of certain major transactions, the Company will be required to repay the Convertible Notes on the date on which such transaction occurs at a price equal to the greater of (i) the outstanding principal and capitalized interest on the Convertible Note plus a make-whole premium and (ii) the sum of (a) the fair market value of the as-converted amount of the Convertible Note for common stock plus (b) the fair market value of additional make-whole shares calculated pursuant to a customary make-whole table. In the event of a major transaction triggered by (i) the common stock or, following an earlier merger, consolidation or similar transaction, the equity securities of a successor entity, ceasing to be listed on a national trading market or (ii) the sale of the Company s property management business, the Purchasers may decline to be repaid. 
 
 In addition, upon certain fundamental transactions that do not result in the foregoing major transactions, the right to convert the Convertible Notes into shares of common stock will be converted into the right to receive the shares of a successor entity, if any, or the Company and any additional consideration receivable as a result of such transaction. 
 
 The Purchase Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants (including restrictions on the Company s ability to incur indebtedness, permit liens, make dividends or distributions, consummate investments and consummate certain affiliate transactions). In addition, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, if the Company s Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for any two consecutive fiscal quarters from and after the fiscal quarter commencing July 1, 2024 is less than , the Company will be required to maintain Liquidity (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) of at least

as of the end of each calendar month until such time as the Company s Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is greater than at the end of any subsequent fiscal quarter. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Convertible Notes provide for customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, the following: nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of covenants or other agreements in the Purchase Agreement and Convertible Notes, certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, the failure of the common stock to be eligible for listing or quotation on a national trading market and the failure of the Company to file certain required reports under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Upon an event of default, the holders of the Convertible Notes may declare the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest immediately due and payable. In addition, after the occurrence of any Event of Default that results in the eventual acceleration of any Convertible Notes, such Convertible Notes bear an additional rate of interest equal to per annum. 
 Embedded Derivatives on the Convertible Debt: 
 The Company determined that the conversion feature meets the definition of a derivative liability. The Company separated the derivative liability from the host debt instrument based on the fair value of the derivative liability. In accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for derivatives and hedging, the Company has bifurcated these embedded derivatives and estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative liability based on a third-party valuation. The resulting discount created by allocating a portion of the issuance proceeds to the embedded derivative is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest method. Changes to the fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected quarterly in the Company s consolidated statements of operations as Change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt. The value of the embedded derivatives is contingent on changes in interest rates, the Company s stock price, stock price volatility, and the Company s dividend yield over the term of the debt.

 Fair V alues of Notes Payable and Other Obligations: 
 The estimated fair value of the Company s notes payable has been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies including the evaluation of the Company s credit risk as described in Note 1. However, considerable judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value and, accordingly, the estimate presented herein is not necessarily indicative of the amount that could be realized in a current market exchange. 
 Notes payable and other obligations 
 Notes payable is recorded on the condensed combined consolidated balance sheets at amortized cost. The determinations of fair values disclosed above would be classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy disclosed in Note 10 if such liabilities were recorded on the condensed combined consolidated balance sheets at fair value.

 In addition, the Company agreed to make certain changes to its business practices and emphasize certain practices that have been a part of Douglas Elliman s longstanding policies and practices, including: reminding its brokerages and agents that the Company has no rule requiring agents to make or accept offers of compensation; requiring its brokerages and agents to clearly disclose to clients that commissions are not set by law and are fully negotiable; prohibiting its brokerages and buyer agents from claiming buyer agent services are free; requiring its brokerages and agents to disclose to the buyer the listing broker s offer of compensation for prospective buyers agents as soon as possible; prohibiting its brokerages and agents from using any technology (or manual methods) to sort listings by offers of compensation, unless requested by the client; reminding its brokerages and agents of their obligation to show properties regardless of compensation for buyers agents for properties that

real estate salespersons formerly associated with the Company as independent contractors, have, together or separately, been named as defendants in multiple complaints by women accusing them of sexual assault and related wrongdoing. While the Company is not named as a defendant in these lawsuits, the salespersons former association with the Company has been reported in various publications. The Company is aware of the potential for litigation against the Company and certain of its current and former executives based on such alleged sexual assault and related wrongdoing, including claims that the Company and those executives are liable or indirectly liable for such wrongdoing. The Company and its executives deny all liability. 
 Litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases or that more cases, including antitrust lawsuits, could be commenced. With the commencement of any new case, the defense costs and the risks relating to the unpredictability of litigation increase. Management reviews on a quarterly basis with counsel all pending litigation and evaluates the probability of a loss being incurred and whether an estimate can be made of the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the financial impact of these litigations. The Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected from an unfavorable outcome in, or settlement of, any of these matters. 
 Accounting Policy . The Company and its subsidiaries record provisions in their consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, other than with respect to the Lawsuits: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of pending cases; or (ii) management is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any pending cases and, therefore, management has not provided any amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any.

 The fair value of the Level 2 certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is the rate offered by the financial institution. 
 The fair values of the Level 3 PropTech convertible trading debt securities were derived using a discounted cash flow model utilizing a probability-weighted expected return method based on the probabilities of different potential outcomes for the convertible trading debt securities. 
 The long-term investments are based on NAV per share provided by the partnerships based on the indicated market value of the underlying assets or investment portfolio. In accordance with ASC Subtopic 820-10, these investments are not classified under the fair value hierarchy disclosed above because they are measured at fair value using the NAV practical expedient. 
 The fair value of derivatives embedded within the convertible debt and the fair value of the convertible debt itself was derived using a binomial lattice valuation model. These derivatives have been classified as Level 3. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives embedded with the convertible debt are presented in the consolidated statements of operations. The value of the embedded derivatives is contingent on changes in interest rates, the Company s stock price, stock price volatility, and the Company s dividend yield. The Company s stock price, volatility, and dividend yield are based on market observable inputs. The interest rate component of the value of the note is computed by calibrating the yield as of the issuance date, such that the value of the convertible note is equal to the Principal less the Original Issue Discount. This yield is adjusted by the change in spreads from the discount curve equivalent to the Company s implied credit rating.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Notes thereto, included in our 2023 Annual Report filed with the SEC, and our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes as of and for the quarterly period and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Any forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Any forward-looking statements are subject to several important factors, including those factors discussed under Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report and this Quarterly Report and Special Note on Forward-Looking Statements, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a holding company and engaged principally in two business segments: 
 Real Estate Brokerage: the residential real estate brokerage services through our subsidiary Douglas Elliman Realty, which operates the largest residential brokerage company in the New York metropolitan area and also conducts residential real estate brokerage operations in Florida, California, Texas, Colorado, Nevada, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. 
 Corporate and other: the operations of our holding company as well as our investment business that invests in select PropTech opportunities through our New Valley Ventures subsidiary. 
 
 Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our financial results, we use the following business metrics to evaluate our business and identify trends affecting our business. To evaluate our operating performance, we also use Adjusted EBITDA attributed to Douglas Elliman, Adjusted EBITDA attributed to Douglas Elliman Margin and financial measures for the last twelve months ended September 30, 2024 Non-GAAP Financial Measures ), which are financial measures not prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Key Business Metrics Last twelve months ended Nine months ended September 30, Year ended December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 2024 2023 Key Business Metrics Total transactions (1) 
 21,466 16,444 16,584 21,606 Gross transaction value (in billions) (2)

 5,062 5,062 5,307 5,150 Annual Retention (5) 
 87 N/A N/A 92 Net loss attributed to Douglas Elliman Inc. (85,162) (70,319) (27,709) (42,552) Net loss income margin (8.81) (9.35) (3.74) (4.45) Adjusted EBITDA attributed to Douglas Elliman (34,792) (17,333) (23,234) (40,693) Adjusted EBITDA attributed to Douglas Elliman Margin (3.60) (2.30) (3.13) (4.26) 
 _____________________________ 
 (1) We calculate total transactions by taking the sum of all transactions closed in which our agent represented the buyer or seller in the purchase or sale of a home (excluding rental transactions). We include a single transaction twice when one or more of our agents represent both the buyer and seller in any given transaction. 
 (2) Gross transaction value is the sum of all closing sale prices for homes transacted by our agents (excluding rental transactions). We include the value of a single transaction twice when our agents serve both the home buyer and home seller in the transaction. 
 (3) Average transaction value per transaction is the quotient of (x) gross transaction value divided by (y) total transactions. 
 (4) The number of Principal Agents is determined as of the last day of the specified period. We use the number of Principal Agents, in combination with our other key business metrics such as total transactions and gross transaction value, as a measure of agent productivity. 
 27 

(5) Annual Retention is the quotient of (x) the prior year revenue generated by agents retained divided by (y) the prior year revenue generated by all agents. We use Annual Retention as a measure of agent stability. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA attributed to Douglas Elliman is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, investment and other income, stock-based compensation expense, benefit from income taxes, and other items. Adjusted EBITDA attributed to Douglas Elliman Margin is the quotient of (x) Adjusted EBITDA attributed to Douglas Elliman divided by (y) revenue. Last twelve months LTM financial measures are non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated by reference to the trailing four-quarter performance for the relevant metric. 
 We believe that Non-GAAP Financial Measures are important measures that supplement analysis of our results of operations and enhance an understanding of our operating performance. We believe Non-GAAP Financial Measures provide a useful measure of operating results unaffected by non-recurring items, differences in capital structures and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. Management uses Non-GAAP Financial Measures as measures to review and assess operating performance of our business, and management and investors should review both the overall performance (GAAP net income) and the operating performance (Non-GAAP Financial Measures) of our business. While management considers Non-GAAP Financial Measures to be important, they should be considered in addition to, but not as substitutes for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income, and net income. In addition, Non-GAAP Financial Measures are susceptible to varying calculations and our measurement of Non-GAAP Financial Measures may not be comparable to those of other companies. 
 Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are provided in the table below.

 Aircraft Leases. On October 17, 2024, the Company delivered notices of termination to terminate, effective as of November 16, 2024, the Aircraft Lease Agreements. 
 Convertible Debt. On July 2, 2024, we issued 50,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible notes due on July 2, 2029 (the Convertible Notes to funds advised by KLIM. The Convertibles Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.0 per annum payable in cash, or, at our election, 8.0 per annum paid in kind, due semi-annually. The convertible notes are convertible into common stock at an initial conversion rate equal to 1.50 per share, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes for general corporate purposes. 
 Litigation Settlement. On April 26, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement to resolve, on a nationwide basis, the Gibson and Umpa cases (the Lawsuits ). The settlement resolves all claims, on a nationwide basis, by the plaintiffs and proposed settlement class members in the Lawsuits, which includes, but is not limited to, all claims concerning brokerage commissions by the proposed settlement class members that were asserted in other lawsuits against us and our subsidiaries (collectively, the Claims ), and releases us, our subsidiaries, and affiliated agents from all Claims. The settlement is not an admission of liability, nor do we concede or validate any of the claims asserted against us. 
 Under the Settlement Agreement, we paid 7,750 , into an escrow fund, on June 12, 2024 and agreed to pay two 5,000 contingent payments subject to certain financial contingencies on or before December 31, 2027 (collectively, the Settlement Amount ).

 In addition, we agreed to make certain changes to our business practices and emphasize certain practices that have been a part of Douglas Elliman s longstanding policies and practices, including: reminding our brokerages and agents that we have no rule requiring agents to make or accept offers of compensation; requiring our brokerages and agents to clearly disclose to clients that commissions are not set by law and are fully negotiable; prohibiting our brokerages and buyer agents from claiming buyer agent services are free; requiring our brokerages and agents to disclose to the buyer the listing broker s offer of compensation for prospective buyers agents as soon as possible; prohibiting our brokerages and agents from using any technology (or manual methods) to sort listings by offers of compensation, unless requested by the client; reminding our brokerages and agents of their obligation to show properties regardless of compensation for buyers agents for properties that meet the buyer s priorities; and developing training materials for our brokerages and agents that support all the practice changes outlined in the injunctive relief. 
 See Note 8 - Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Update on Expense Reduction. Since June 2022, our operating results have been negatively impacted by a reduction of revenues from existing home sales caused, in part, by lower listing inventory and the volatility in the financial markets as well as increases in mortgage rates. As a result, during 2023 and 2024, we have endeavored to adjust our cost structure to better fit our business, including through, among other things, reductions in personnel and incentive compensation expense, eliminating certain corporate sponsorship events, streamlining advertising expenditures and beginning a process of consolidating offices as leases expire. These efforts have been undertaken to increase the efficiency of our operations without significantly impacting the agent experience. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our real estate brokerage segment reduced its operating expenses, excluding commissions, litigation settlement, restructuring expenses and non-cash stock compensation expenses by approximately 11,900 (5.9 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. These reductions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 11,900 of general and administrative expenses. 
 In 2023, we actively executed expense reduction programs that reduced expenses in our business, including our headcount by approximately 100 employees in 2023. These programs are continuing in 2024. In addition, in the second quarter of 2024, a lease on property used by one of our subsidiaries expired and it has moved its operations to a new location resulting in an approximate 4,000 reduction in annual occupancy costs on an ongoing basis.

Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion provides an assessment of our results of operations, capital resources and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The following table sets forth our revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues by segment: Real estate brokerage segment 266,316 251,548 Operating income (loss) by segment: Real estate brokerage segment 454 (1,992) Corporate and other segment (7,885) (6,829) Total operating loss (7,431) (8,821) Real estate brokerage segment Operating income (loss) 454 (1,992) Depreciation and amortization 1,898 1,999 Restructuring 18 215 Stock-based compensation 1,258 1,175 Adjusted EBITDA 3,628 1,397 Adjusted EBITDA attributed to non-controlling interest 182 138 Adjusted EBITDA attributed to Douglas Elliman 3,810 1,535 Corporate and other segment Operating loss (7,885) (6,829) Stock-based compensation 2,629 2,267 Adjusted EBITDA attributed to Douglas Elliman (5,256) (4,562) 
 Revenues . Our revenues were 266,316 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 251,548 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 14,768 increase in revenues was primarily due to increases in commission and other brokerage revenues which primarily related to increases in commissions from existing home sales and development marketing. 
 Operating expenses . Our operating expenses were 273,747 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 260,369 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 13,378 was due primarily to an increase in real estate agent commissions of 13,288 arising primarily from increases in commissions and other brokerage revenue partially offset by declines in general and administrative expenses. 
 Operating loss . Operating loss was 7,431 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8,821 for the same period in 2023. The 1,390 decline in operating loss was due to the net impact of increases in commission and other brokerage revenues partially offset by the increases in operating expenses. 
 Other (losses) income . Other losses was 20,018 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income of 1,822 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other losses primarily consisted of the change in fair value of embedded derivative of 20,166, interest expense of 1,461, primarily associated with the debt issuance, and investment and other losses, primarily associated with our PropTech investments of 4. This was offset by interest income of 1,551 and equity in earnings from equity method investments of 62. 
 31 

Loss before provision for income taxes . Loss before income taxes was 27,449 and 6,999 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Income tax expense (benefit) . Income tax expense was 0 compared to income tax benefit of 1,869 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We calculate our provision for income taxes based upon our estimate of the annual effective income tax rate based on full year projections and apply the annual effective income tax rate against year-to-date pretax income to record income tax expense, adjusted for discrete items, if any. We refine annual estimates as current information becomes available. 
 Real Estate Brokerage. 
 The following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of operations data for the Real Estate Brokerage segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024

 Revenues. Our revenues were 266,316 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 251,548 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 14,768 was primarily related to an increase in our commission and other brokerage income, as a result of an increase in commissions from existing home sales and development marketing. The increase in revenues was driven by an increased average price per transaction of 1.61 million per homesale in three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.57 million per homesale in the comparable 2023 period. 
 Our revenues from commission and other brokerage income were 254,074 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 239,255 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 14,819. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, our commission and other brokerage income generated from the sales of existing homes increased by 6,939 in New York City, 1,143 in the Northeast region, which excludes New York City. This was partially offset by declines of 3,231 in the Florida market, and 740 in the West region. In addition, our revenues from Development Marketing increased by 10,708 in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period and was primarily from an increase in closed sales in the Florida market. 
 Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses were 265,862 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 253,540 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 12,322, due primarily to increases in real estate brokerage commissions, partially offset by reductions in general and administrative and technology expenses. The primary components of operating expenses are described below. 
 Real Estate Agent Commissions. As a result of increases in our commissions and other brokerage income, our real estate agent commissions expense was 199,133 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 185,845 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Real estate agent commissions expense, as a percentage of revenues, increased to 74.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 73.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 32 

Operations and support. Operations and support expenses were 18,774 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17,121 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily related to higher professional fees in the 2024 period. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses were 20,774 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21,988 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline is primarily related to reductions in personnel as well as lower incentive compensation expenses offset by higher professional fees. 
 Technology. Technology expenses were 6,025 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5,602 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted from continued expense reduction efforts in 2024, which included the negotiation of existing licensing agreements in an effort to improve our technology efficiency. 
 Operating income (loss) Operating income was 454 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to operating loss of 1,992 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating income is primarily associated with the net impact of increased commission and other brokerage revenues and partially offset by increases in operating expenses. 
 Corporate and Other. 
 Corporate and Other loss. The operating loss at the Corporate and Other segment was 7,885 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6,829 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in operating expenses.

 Revenues . Our revenues were 752,306 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 741,442 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 10,864 increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in commissions and other brokerage income because of increased commissions from existing home sales. 
 Operating expenses . Our operating expenses were 804,874 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 782,368 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 22,506 was due primarily to the litigation settlement of 17,750 and increases in real estate brokerage commissions of 17,857 partially offset by a decline in other operating expenses of 13,101. 
 Operating loss . Operating loss was 52,568 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 40,926 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 11,642 increase in operating loss was primarily due to the litigation settlement and the net impact of declines in commissions and other brokerage revenues partially offset by a decline in operating expenses. 
 Other (loss) income . Other loss was 16,978 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income of 4,226 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other losses primarily consisted of the change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt of 20,166 associated with the issuance of the new financing debt, and interest expense of 1,475. This was partially offset by interest income of 3,989, 625 of investment and other income primarily associated with our PropTech investments, and equity earnings from equity method investments of 49. 
 Loss before provision for income taxes . Loss before income taxes was 69,546 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 36,700 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 34 

Income tax expense (benefit) . Income tax expense was 1,368 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax benefit of 8,552 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We calculate our provision for income taxes based upon our estimate of the annual effective income tax rate based on full year projections and apply the annual effective income tax rate against year-to-date pretax income to record income tax expense, adjusted for discrete items, if any. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we analyzed the likelihood of utilizing our deferred tax assets and determined it will be more likely than not that the benefits of these deductible differences will not be realized, and as a result we established a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax assets. We refine annual estimates as current information becomes available. 
 Real Estate Brokerage. 
 The following table sets forth our condensed consolidated statements of operations data for the Real Estate Brokerage segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023:

Summary of PropTech Investments 
 As of September 30, 2024, New Valley Ventures had investments (at a carrying value) of approximately 13,037 in PropTech companies. This amounts to approximately 3 of the value of Douglas Elliman s total assets, which totaled approximately 503 million, as of September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by 27,746 to 157,263, which included 5,847 of restricted cash, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and by 37,493, which included restricted cash of 7,549, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cash used in operations was 16,987 and 27,773 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline in the cash used in the 2024 period was related to the receipt of income tax refunds and lower uses of working capital. This was partially offset by lower operating income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 2,009 and 5,487 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was comprised of capital expenditures of 4,273 and the purchase of investments of 259 in our PropTech business. This was offset by 2,523 of distributions from our investments in equity securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was comprised of capital expenditures of 5,380, and purchase of investments of 515 in our PropTech business. This was offset by 408 of distributions from our investments in equity securities. 
 Our investment philosophy is to maximize return on investments using a reasonable expectation for return when investing in equity-method investments and PropTech investments as well as making capital expenditures. 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 46,742 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in financing activities of 4,233 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was comprised of proceeds from debt issuance of 48,750. This was offset by deferred financing charges of 1,997 and 11 for payroll tax liabilities associated with restricted stock withheld upon the vesting of restricted stock. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was comprised of dividends and distributions on common stock of 4,222 and 11 for payroll tax liabilities associated with restricted stock withheld upon the vesting of restricted stock. 
 We paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.05 per share from March 2022 to March 2023. On June 12, 2023, we announced that our Board had suspended the quarterly cash dividend, effective immediately. On June 12, 2023, our Board also declared a stock dividend on our common stock of 5 , which was paid on June 30, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 22, 2023. 
 36 

Real Estate Brokerage Litigation . On April 26, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve all claims on a nationwide basis in the pending class action litigations, Gibson v. NAR, No. 4:23-cv-00788-SRB (W.D. Mo.) and Umpa v. NAR, 4:23-cv-00945-SRB (W.D. Mo.) alleging claims on behalf of sellers against Douglas Elliman Inc. and our subsidiaries. Under the settlement agreement, the Company paid 7,750 into an escrow fund on June 12, 2024, and agreed to pay two 5,000 contingent payments subject to certain financial contingencies on or before December 31, 2027 (collectively, the Settlement Amount ). The contingent payments may be accelerated under certain circumstances. The Company recognized an expens e of 17,750 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in other pending cases or that more cases, including antitrust lawsuits, could be concerned. 
 See Note 8 Contingencies for a complete discussion of Real Estate Brokerage Litigation and related litigation. 
 Other litigation. Two real estate salespersons formerly associated with the Company as independent contractors, have, together or separately, been named as defendants in multiple complaints by women accusing them of sexual assault and related wrongdoing. While the Company is not named as a defendant in these lawsuits, the salespersons former association with the Company has been reported in various publications. The Company is aware of the potential for litigation against the Company and certain of its current and former executives based on such alleged sexual assault and related wrongdoing, including claims that the Company and those executives are liable or indirectly liable for such wrongdoing. The Company and its executives deny all liability. 
 Management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met. Management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the cases pending against the real estate brokerage segment or the costs of defending such cases. It is possible that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any future period could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such brokerage-related litigation. 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 151,416 as of September 30, 2024 and, in addition to any cash provided from operations, such cash is available to be used to fund such liquidity requirements as well as other anticipated liquidity needs in the normal course of business. Management currently anticipates that these amounts, as well as expected cash flows from our operations and proceeds from any financings to the extent available, should be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months. We may acquire or seek to acquire additional operating businesses through a merger, purchase of assets, stock acquisition or other means, or to make or seek to make other investments, which may limit our liquidity otherwise available. 
 On July 2, 2024, we issued 50,000 in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes due 2029. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.0 per annum, payable in cash, or, at our election, 8.0 per annum paid in kind, due semi-annually. See Note 7 Notes Payable for more information concerning our Convertible Notes. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have various agreements in which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights. Payment by us under such indemnification clauses is generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential number of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not been material. As of September 30, 2024, we were not aware of any indemnification agreements that would or are reasonably expected to have a current or future material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding approximately 3,000 of letters of credit, collateralized by certificates of deposit. The letters of credit have been issued as security deposits for leases of office space, to secure the performance of our subsidiaries under various insurance programs and to provide collateral for various subsidiary borrowing and capital lease arrangements. 
 37 

As a service to its customers, Portfolio Escrow Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, administers escrow and trust deposits which represent undisbursed amounts received for the settlement of real estate transactions. Deposits at FDIC-insured institutions are insured up to 250. The escrow funds on deposit at the subsidiary were 36,061 and 41,338 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and corresponding escrow funds in holding of the same amount. While these deposits are not assets of the Company (and, therefore, are excluded from the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets), the subsidiary of the Company remains contingently liable for the disposition of these deposits. 

Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks principally from fluctuations in interest rates and could be exposed to market risks from foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices in the future. We seek to minimize these risks through our regular operating and financing activities and our long-term investment strategy. Our market risk management procedures cover material market risks for our market risk sensitive financial instruments.
