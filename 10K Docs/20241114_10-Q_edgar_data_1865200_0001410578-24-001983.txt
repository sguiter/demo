Risks and Uncertainties Management is currently evaluating the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, the war in Israel, interest rate fluctuations, and the recently adopted Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC rules and amendments affecting special purpose acquisition corporations like the Company, and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that such matters could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impacts are not readily determinable as of September 30, 2024. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from whom shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The IR Act applies only to repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. On July 7, 2023, shares of Class A common stock were redeemed by the Company s stockholders for a total of in connection with the First Special Meeting.

The Company evaluated the classification and accounting of the stock redemption under ASC 450, Contingencies . ASC 450 states that when a loss contingency exists, the likelihood that the future events will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable to remote. A contingent liability must be reviewed at each reporting period to determine appropriate treatment. The Company evaluated the current status and probability of completing an initial Business Combination as of September 30, 2024 and

The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. Management plans to address this uncertainty through capital contributions or working capital loans whereby, the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company s officers and directors can, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (see Note 5). However, there is no assurance that the Company s plans to raise capital or to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period.

Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable in certain redemption scenarios and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the initial purchasers thereof or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers thereof or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.

The Company expects to account for the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants as liabilities in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity . Because the Company does not control the occurrence of events, such as a tender offer or exchange, that may trigger cash settlement of the warrants where not all of the stockholders also receive cash, the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, as such, the warrants must be recorded as derivative liability. Additionally, certain adjustments to the settlement amount of the Private Placement Warrants are based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed option as defined under ASC 815-40, and thus the Private Placement Warrants are not considered indexed to the Company s own stock and not eligible for an exception from derivative accounting. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record a derivative liability upon the issuance of the warrants at the closing of this offering. Accordingly, the Company classifies each warrant as a liability at its fair value. The Public Warrants will be allocated a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Units equal to its fair value determined with the assistance of a professional independent valuation firm. The warrant liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s statement of operations. The Company reassess the classification of the warrants at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the warrants will be reclassified as of the date of the event that causes the reclassification. There has been no change in the classification of the warrants as of September 30, 2024.

In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the Company s consummation of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company is not required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period with respect to such securities. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The Company granted the underwriter a -day option from the date of the IPO to purchase up to additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discount. On December 13, 2021, the underwriter exercised the option in full, closing the sale of the additional Units on December 14, 2021.

In addition, the underwriter was entitled to a deferred fee of per Unit, or in the aggregate, payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On August 22, 2022, the underwriter delivered a letter to the Company pursuant to which the underwriter waived its entitlement to the payment of the deferred underwriting fee. The waived fee was recorded to accumulated deficit.

The Company accounted for the Non-Redemption Agreements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5T SAB Topic 5T ). The Company considered the Sponsor s transfer of Class B common stock to the unaffiliated third parties in exchange for the Non-Redemption Agreements as a capital contribution by the Sponsor, and recognized the excess fair value of the transferred Class B common stock as a non-redemption agreement expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (i) at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Closing ), upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended, Merger Sub will merge with and into Angel Studios, with Angel Studios continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Southport (the Merger (ii) at the Closing, all of the outstanding capital stock of Angel Studios (other than shares subject to Angel Studios options, shares held in treasury and any dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, of Southport Southport Common Stock ), in an aggregate amount equal to (x) 1,500,000,000 plus the aggregate gross proceeds of any capital raised by Angel Studios prior to the Closing, divided by (y) 10.00; (iii) at the Closing, all of the outstanding options to acquire capital stock of Angel Studios will be converted into comparable options to acquire shares of Southport Common Stock (subject to appropriate adjustments to the number of shares of Southport Common Stock underlying such options and the exercise price of such options); (iv) subject to the approval of the holders of Southport s public warrants, Southport will amend its public warrants so that, immediately prior to the Closing, each of the issued and outstanding Southport public warrants automatically will convert into 0.1 newly issued share of Southport Class A Common Stock and such warrants will cease to be outstanding; and (v) at the Closing, Southport will be renamed Angel Studios, Inc. . The Merger Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including, among others, the approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by the respective stockholders of Southport and Angel Studios, and the approval by Southport s stockholders of an extension to Southport s deadline to consummate a business combination to September 30, 2025. On October 2, 2024, the Company filed a definitive proxy statement with respect to a third special meeting of stockholders (the Third Special Meeting to obtain stockholder approval to further amend the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the time by which the Company must consummate its initial Business Combination from December 14, 2024 to September 30, 2025, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Third Extension Amendment Proposal ). On October 11, 2024, the Company received a redemption report from the Trustee indicating that, as of October 11, 2024, the holders of 985,170 shares of the Company s Class A common stock had properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 11.08 per share. On October 14, 2024, the Company determined to postpone the Third Special Meeting originally scheduled for October 15, 2024, to October 22, 2024, to allow additional time for the Company to engage with its stockholders and solicit redemption reversals. On October 21, 2024, the Company cancelled the Third Special Meeting and announced that it intended to file an amendment to the definitive proxy statement to reflect the addition of a new proposal to amend the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to eliminate the limitation that the Company may not redeem its outstanding shares of Class A common stock to the extent that such redemption would result in the Company having net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), of less than 5,000,001, in order to allow the Company to redeem such shares irrespective of whether such redemption would exceed this limitation (the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal ). Accordingly, the redemptions indicated on the October 11, 2024 redemption report from the Trustee in connection with the Third Special Meeting were not processed. On October 29, 2024, the Company filed an amendment to the definitive proxy statement that was filed with the SEC on October 2, 2024 (the Original Filing that amends and restates the Original Filing to: 1) reschedule the Third Special Meeting originally scheduled for October 15, 2024 and postponed to October 22, 2024 (as previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2024) to November 13, 2024 and 2) reflect the addition of the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal. On November 12, 2024, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 with the SEC in connection with the Business Combination with Angel Studios.

 cash at a redemption price of approximately 11.08 per share of Class A common stock, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 12 million. Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events Our entire activity from inception through September 30, 2024 relates solely to our formation, our IPO and, pursuit of an initial business combination. We have not generated any operating revenues to date, and we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 1,495,898, which consisted of 165,500 dividend income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account, offset by a 1,392,000 loss on the change in fair value of warrant liability, provision for income tax of 24,220, 87,371 in legal and accounting expenses, 51,268 of franchise tax expense, 56,000 of administrative expenses (of which 45,000 are due to related party), 25,813 of insurance expense, 21,250 of listing fees, 3,108 of other operating costs, and 368 of bank fees.

For nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 2,831,194, which consisted of 6,120,704 dividend income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account, offset by a loss of 725,950 on the change in fair value of the warrant liability, 522,948 of financing expenses related to the excess fair value of Class B common stock transferred by the Sponsor, provision for income tax of 1,253,934, 211,771 in legal and accounting expenses, 149,589 of franchise tax expense, 227,594 of insurance expense, 128,248 of administrative expenses, 63,750 of listing fees, and 5,726 of bank fees. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 517,975 and 2,171,553, respectively, and working capital deficit of 3,166,088 and 2,808,465, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1,860,000. Net loss of 1,739,275 was decreased by a non-redemption agreement expense of 274,973 related to the transfer of Class B shares by the Sponsor and a 1,275,000 loss on the change in fair value of warrant liability, and increased by 53,099 of accrued dividends on marketable securities held in the Trust Account, and 1,618,101 decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 5,745,670. Net income of 2,831,194 was increased by a 725,950 loss on the fair value of the warrant liability, 522,948 of non-cash financing expense related to the transfer of Class B shares by the Sponsor, and a 1,853,840 increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities, offset by a decrease for 188,262 of accrued dividends on marketable securities held in the Trust Account.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 12,895,117 and 44,709,805, respectively, consisting of securities held in a money market fund that invests in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of 185 days or less. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 517,975 and 2,171,553, respectively, held outside the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. Our management does not expect that we will be able to fund our liquidity requirements in the next 12 months from our current working capital. In order to fund the expected working capital deficiency or to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, our management plans to seek capital contributions or loans from our management team or our Sponsor or any of their respective affiliates. However, neither our management team nor our Sponsor or their respective affiliates are obligated to provide capital contributions or loan us these funds, and, as such, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient loans to fund any working capital deficiency. If we receive such loans, up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. These warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Sponsor has provided 220,000 and 553,227, respectively, in cash through a capital contribution and no amounts through loans. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Sponsor did not provide cash through a capital contribution or loans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within 12 months from September 30, 2024. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. In addition, we may target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds from our IPO and the Private Placement, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy redemptions by public stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. On May 25, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Company, the Sponsor converted 4,200,000 shares of the Company s Class B common stock held by it on a one-for-one basis into shares of the Company s Class A common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 27,200,000 shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding, comprised of 4,200,000 shares of Class A common stock held by the Sponsor and not subject to possible redemption and 23,000,000 shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption. On June 9, 2023, the holders of 18,849,935 shares of Class A common stock properly exercised their right to redeem their shares in connection with the First Special Meeting for 197,694,657 in cash, resulting in 4,150,065 shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding that are subject to possible redemption. On March 14, 2024, the holders of 2,986,952 shares of Class A common stock properly exercised their right to redeem their shares in connection with the Second Special Meeting for 32,214,591 in cash, resulting in 1,163,113 shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding that are subject to possible redemption.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement for our IPO, the underwriter of our IPO was entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per unit, or 8,050,000 in the aggregate, payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. However, on August 22, 2022, the underwriter delivered a letter to the Company pursuant to which the underwriter waived its entitlement to the payment of the deferred underwriting fee. We have entered into a letter agreement with our Sponsor pursuant to which we are required to pay our Sponsor a total of 15,000 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative services, commencing on December 10, 2021, the date that our securities were first listed on the NYSE, through the earlier of our initial Business Combination and our liquidation.

The Sponsor Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of September 30, 2025 or the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination, the Sponsor Promissory Note will not be repaid and all amounts owed under the Sponsor Promissory Note will be forgiven except to the extent that the Company as funds available to it outside of the Trust Account. Commitments and Contingencies Registration rights The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and in each case holders of the underlying securities thereof, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on December 9, 2021, requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A common stock). The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the Company s consummation of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company is not required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period with respect to such securities. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement We granted the underwriter a 45-day option from the date of our IPO to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discount. On December 13, 2021, the underwriter exercised the option in full, closing the sale of the 3,000,000 additional Units on December 14, 2021. The underwriter was paid an underwriting commission of 4,600,000 upon the closing of our IPO. In addition, the underwriter was entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per unit, or 8,050,000 in the aggregate, payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

 On August 22, 2022, the underwriter delivered a letter to the Company pursuant to which the underwriter waived its entitlement to the payment of the deferred underwriting fee. The 8,050,000 waived fee was recorded to accumulated deficit. Non-Redemption Agreements On May 25, 2023, the Company and the Sponsor entered into Non-Redemption Agreements with unaffiliated third parties in exchange for such third parties agreeing (i) not to redeem an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of Class A common stock sold in its initial public offering (the Non-Redeemed Shares in connection with the First Special Meeting and (ii) to vote in favor of the First Extension Amendment Proposal and the First Extension at the First Special Meeting (other than with respect to certain shares acquired or to be acquired pursuant to the Non-Redemption Agreements). In exchange for the foregoing commitments, the Sponsor agreed to transfer to such third parties an aggregate of up to 1,499,996 shares of Class B common stock held by the Sponsor, with 500,000 of such shares to be transferred to such third parties promptly upon consummation of the First Extension, and an additional 166,666 shares to be transferred to such third parties monthly beginning on September 14, 2023 and up to, and including, February 14, 2024, if the board of directors of the Company elects to further extend the deadline to consummate an initial Business Combination at or prior to such date, in each case, if such third parties continue to hold such Non-Redeemed Shares through the First Special Meeting. Prior to March 31, 2024, the Company had extended the deadline to complete the business combination six times, to March 14, 2024, resulting in a total of 1,499,996 shares of Class B common stock being transferred to such third parties. The Company accounted for the Non-Redemption Agreements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5T SAB Topic 5T ). The Company considered the Sponsor s transfer of Class B common stock to the unaffiliated third parties in exchange for the Non-Redemption Agreements as a capital contribution by the Sponsor, and recognized the excess fair value of the transferred Class B common stock as a non-redemption agreement expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company determined the excess fair value of the 1,499,996 Class B shares transferred to such third parties to be 1,209,879. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates as of September 30, 2024. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. The net proceeds from our IPO and the Private Placement held in the Trust Account are invested in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

 also acts as our principal accounting officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a 15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, related to the fact that the Company has not yet designed and maintained effective controls relating to the presentation of our statement of cash flows and recognition of excise tax liability. As previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as of December 31, 2022, we identified a material weakness related to the fact that we had not yet designed and maintained effective controls relating to the presentation of our statements of cash flows, which continues to exist as of September 30, 2024. In addition, as previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as of December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness related to the fact that we had not yet designed and maintained effective controls relating to the recognition of excise tax liability within our financial statements, which continues to exist as of September 30, 2024. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Remediation Activities As previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, we implemented a remediation plan to address the material weakness identified as of December 31, 2022. Our Chief Executive Officer will continue to perform additional post-closing review procedures including consulting with subject matter experts related to the accounting for marketable securities and stockholder redemptions. Additionally, we implemented a remediation plan to address the material weakness identified as of December 31, 2023. Our Chief Executive Officer will continue to perform additional post-closing review procedures including consulting with tax and legal subject matter experts related to the accounting for stockholder redemptions. The Company s management has expended, and will continue to expend, a substantial amount of effort and resources for the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements, we have improved, and will continue to improve, these processes to ensure that transactions are effectively evaluated in the context of the increasingly complex accounting standards. We plan to continue to enhance our review procedures of evaluating and implementing the accounting standards that apply to our financial statements, including additional analyses by our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting, tax and legal matters. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except as disclosed above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this quarterly report are any of the risks described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities We did not sell any unregistered equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Use of Proceeds from our IPO On December 14, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 23,000,000 Units, which included 3,000,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise in full by BofA Securities, Inc., the underwriter, of its over-allotment option, which option was granted to the underwriter under the underwriting agreement for our IPO. The Units were sold at a price of 10.00 per Unit, and our IPO generated gross proceeds of 230,000,000. The securities sold in our IPO were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-261370). The SEC declared the registration statement effective on December 9, 2021. At the time of the consummation of our IPO, we paid a total of 4,600,000 in underwriting fees related to our IPO. In addition, the underwriter agreed to defer 8,050,000 in underwriting fees. On August 22, 2022, the underwriter delivered a letter to the Company pursuant to which the underwriter waived its entitlement to the payment of the deferred underwriting fee. On December 14, 2021, a total of 234,600,000 of the net proceeds from our IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in the Trust Account. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account and are available for a Business Combination, assuming no redemptions, before fees and expenses associated with our initial Business Combination. The proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Through December 14, 2021, we incurred 1,285,218 for other costs and expenses related to our IPO. In connection with the vote to approve the First Extension Amendment Proposal, the holders of 18,849,935 shares of Class A common stock properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.49 per share of Class A common stock, for an aggregate redemption amount of 197,694,657. The Trustee redeemed 197,694,657 of marketable securities held in the Trust Account to pay the holders redeeming 18,849,935 shares of Class A common stock on July 7, 2023. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers during the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 None.
