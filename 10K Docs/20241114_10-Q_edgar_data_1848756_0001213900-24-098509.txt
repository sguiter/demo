including additional Units to cover over-allotments (the Over-Allotment Units ), at per Unit, generating
gross proceeds of , and incurring in other offering costs, in upfront underwriting fees (Note 5). 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial
Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement Private Placement of warrants (each, a Private
Placement Warrant and collectively, the Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant
to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of (Note 4). 

Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering
and the Private Placement, per Unit) of the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement
Warrants were deposited into a trust account (the Trust Account in the United States at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee, to be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning
set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), which invest only
in direct U.S, government treasury obligations until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution
of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s shareholders, as described below. On April 24, 2024, the Company amended the
investment management trust agreement, dated as of October 26, 2021, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, as trustee (as amended, the Trust Agreement ), to permit Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company (the Trustee ),
to hold the assets in the Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account or cash until the earlier of the consummation of
an initial business combination or the Company s liquidation. On the same day, the Company instructed the Trustee to liquidate the
investments held in the Trust Account and move the funds to an interest-bearing demand deposit account, with Continental continuing to
act as trustee. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public
Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds.

of the balance in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes
payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The
Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding
voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register
as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect
a Business Combination. 

The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding
Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the
completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination or
(ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with an initial business combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business
Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which Public Shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they
vote for or against a Business Combination. 

If the Company seeks shareholder approval of a
Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company s amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association (the Articles provides that, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of
such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section
13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights
with respect to or more of the Public Shares without the Company s prior written consent. 

The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem
their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially per share, plus any pro rata interest or
dividend earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share
amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the
Company will pay to the representative of the underwriter (as discussed in Note 5). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion
of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. These Class A ordinary shares were recorded at a redemption value
and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 

If a shareholder vote is not required and the
Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Articles, offer
such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and file tender
offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing
a Business Combination. 

The Company s Sponsor, officers and directors
agreed (a) to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering
in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company s Articles with respect to the Company s
pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting Public
Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including
the Founder Shares) and Private Placement Warrants (including underlying securities) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account
in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a
Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the
Articles relating to shareholders rights of pre- Business Combination activity and (d) that the Founder Shares and Private Placement
Warrants (including underlying securities) shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination
is not consummated. However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public
Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.

of interest or dividend to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares,
which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further
liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption,
subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation
and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirement
of applicable law. The representative of the underwriter agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the
Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date and, in such event, such amounts
will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event
of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the
Initial Public Offering price per Unit ). 

The Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to the
Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target
business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Sio Business Combination
agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount
per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions
in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective
target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable)
nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company
has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor
has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company
for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

First Extension Meeting 

On April 24, 2023, we held an extraordinary general
meeting of shareholders (the First Extension Meeting ), pursuant to which our shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles
to extend the date by which the Company must complete initial business combination from April 29, 2023 to April 29, 2024 (the First
Extended Date (or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors and included in a public announcement) (the First
Extension ). In connection therewith, the Sponsor agreed to loan us for each calendar month beginning on April 30, 2023
and ending on the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the date of the our liquidation in accordance with the terms
of the First Extension, up to a maximum aggregate amount of million (the First Extension Contribution ). On May 4,
2023, we issued a convertible promissory note (the First Extension Note to the Sponsor with a principal amount up to 
million. Pursuant to the First Extension Note, the Sponsor may convert the principal outstanding into warrants at per warrant. Such
warrants will be identical to the terms of the Private Placement Warrants. In connection with the vote to approve the First Extension,
the holders of Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price
of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately million, resulting in public shares
remaining. In addition, on April 28, 2023, holders of Class B ordinary shares elected to convert such shares into Class A ordinary
shares on a one-for-one basis for no consideration. 

The shareholders also approved a proposal to amend
the Articles to permit the Company s board of directors (the Board ), in its sole discretion, to elect to wind up the
Company s operations on an earlier date than the Extended Date as determined by the Board and included in a public announcement.
The shareholders also approved a proposal to amend the Articles to eliminate the limitation that the Company may not redeem public shares
in an amount that would cause the Company s net tangible assets to be less than in connection with the Company s
initial business combination. The shareholders also approved a proposal to provide for the right of a holder of the Company s Class
B ordinary shares, par value per share (the Class B ordinary shares ), to convert into Class A ordinary shares, par
value per share, on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of an initial business combination at the election of the holder. 

Second Extension Meeting 

On April 26, 2024, the Company had an extraordinary
general meeting of its shareholders (the Second Extension Meeting to vote on another amendment to its amended and restated
articles and memorandum of association to extend the deadline by which it has to complete an initial business combination from April 29,
2024 to April 29, 2025 (the Second Extension ). In connection with the vote to approve the Second Extension, the holders
of public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share,
for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately million, resulting in public shares outstanding. In connection with
the Second Extension Meeting, the Sponsor agreed to loan us for each calendar month beginning on April 30, 2024 and ending on
the earlier of (i) the completion of a business combination, (ii) the date of the our liquidation in accordance with the terms of the
Second Extension and (iii) April 29, 2025, up to a maximum aggregate amount of million (the Second Extension Contribution ),
and on April 26, 2024, the Company issued a promissory note (the Second Extension Note , together with the First Extension
Note, the Extension Notes to the Sponsor in the amount of million in connection with the Second Extension Contributions.
The Second Extension Note will fund extension deposit of for each calendar month beginning on April 30, 2024 until April 29, 2025.

and respectively had been drawn on the Extension Notes and there were Trust Account deposits in connection with the
Extension Notes, totaling . 

Sio Business Combination 

On November 13, 2023, the Company entered into
a Sio Business Combination Agreement with Sio, Sio Newco, and Pyrophyte Newco, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the
terms and conditions contained therein, (i) the Company will transfer by way of continuation from the Cayman Islands to Alberta in accordance
with the Cayman Islands Companies Act (as revised) (the Companies Act and continue as an Alberta corporation in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) (the ABCA (such continuation, the Domestication ),
(ii) following the Domestication, Pyrophyte will amalgamate with Sio Newco (the SPAC Amalgamation ), with Sio Newco surviving
the SPAC Amalgamation Pubco in accordance with the terms of a Plan of Arrangement (the Plan of Arrangement ),
and (iii) Sio and Pyrophyte Newco will amalgamate (the Sio Amalgamation and together with the SPAC Amalgamation, the Amalgamations ),
with Sio surviving the Sio Amalgamation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco and such entity will continue the business operations currently
undertaken by Sio. 

Subscription Agreements 

Concurrently with the execution of the Sio Business
Combination Agreement, Pyrophyte, Sio and Sio Newco entered into subscription agreements with (i) a certain accredited investor (the Non-Insider
PIPE Investor and (ii) certain other accredited investors who are existing shareholders of Sio or the Company (the Insider
PIPE Investors and, together with the Non-Insider PIPE Investor, the PIPE Investors ), pursuant to which, among other
things, Sio Newco agreed to issue and sell, in a private placement to close concurrently with and conditioned upon the effectiveness of
the consummation of the Sio Business Combination, an aggregate of Pubco Class A Common Shares (the PIPE Investment to the PIPE Investors for an aggregate purchase price equal to . 

Sio Securityholder Support Agreements 

In connection with the execution of the Sio Business
Combination Agreement, on November 13, 2023, the Company, Sio, and certain securityholders of Sio entered into support agreements (the
 Sio Securityholder Support Agreements ), pursuant to which, among other things, such shareholders agreed to vote (or cause
to be voted) all of their Sio shares and other voting securities of Sio Subject Securities in favor of the special resolution
of Sio shareholders in respect of the Plan of Arrangement, to be considered at Sio s shareholders meeting to approve the Sio Business
Combination. Additionally, such shareholders have agreed, among other things, not to, prior to the Closing, (a) transfer any of their
Subject Securities (or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding in connection therewith other than pursuant to the Plan
of Arrangement), subject to certain customary exceptions, or (b) enter into any voting arrangement that is inconsistent with the Sio Securityholder
Support Agreements. Sio covenants in the Sio Business Combination Agreement that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
Sio Securityholder Support Agreements from at least of its shareholders as promptly as possible, but in any event, within five days
of the execution date of the Sio Business Combination Agreement. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 
in cash. Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition
plans. If the Company s estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence, and negotiating
a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate
its business prior to an initial business combination. The liquidation deadline for the Company is also within the next twelve months
if an initial business combination is not consummated. The Company cannot assure that its plans to consummate an initial business combination
will be successful. 

As a result of the above, in connection with the
Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial
Statements Going Concern , management has determined that the liquidity conditions and the proximity to liquidation
date raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying

Public warrants
to purchase Class A ordinary shares to investors in the Company s Initial Public Offering and simultaneously issued Private
Placement Warrants. All of the Company s outstanding warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40.
Accordingly, we recognize the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting
period. The liabilities are subject to re- measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized
in the consolidated statements of income. 

Class A ordinary
shares the Company agreed to transfer to the Investors on or promptly after the consummation of the Sio Business Combination pursuant
to the Non-Redemption Agreement on November 13, 2023, the Company estimated the aggregate fair value of the Class A ordinary shares
attributable to the non-redeeming Pyrophyte shareholder to be or a weighted average of per share, which is estimated by
taking into considerations the estimated probability of the consummation of consummating the Sio Business Combination. The fair value
of the Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the non-redeeming shareholder was determined to be an offering cost in accordance with
Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A. In substance, the Company recognized the offering cost as a capital contribution to induce the shareholder
not to redeem its Class A ordinary shares, with a corresponding charge to additional paid-in capital to recognize the fair value of the
shares transferred as an offering cost.

Units at a purchase price of per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A ordinary shares and one-half
of one redeemable warrant Public Warrant ). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase share of Class
A ordinary shares at an exercise price of per share. 

,
or approximately per share, to cover certain offering costs in consideration for Class B ordinary shares, par value 
(the Founder Shares ). Up to Founder Shares were subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor depending on the extent to
which the underwriter s over-allotment option was exercised. At the close of the Initial Public Offering, the underwriter exercised
its overallotment option in full and these Founder Shares were no longer subjected to forfeiture as of October 29, 2021. 

On September 29, 2021, the Sponsor effected a
surrender of Class B ordinary shares to the Company for no consideration, resulting in an aggregate of of Class B ordinary
shares outstanding. Prior to the initial investment in the Company of by the Sponsor, we had no assets, tangible or intangible.
The per share purchase price of the Founder Shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the Company by the aggregate
number of Founder Shares issued. In connection with the First Extension, on April 28, 2023, all Class B ordinary shares were
converted from Class B ordinary shares into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis for no consideration. 

Private Placement Warrants 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial
Public Offering, the Company consummated the Private Placement of Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private
Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of . 

Each warrant is exercisable to purchase Class
A ordinary share at a price of per share. Certain proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the proceeds
from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date,
the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the
requirement of applicable law) and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.

for working capital loans (as amended and restated, the Working Capital Loan ). If the Company completes an initial business
combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. In the
event that an initial business combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to
repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working
Capital Loans bear no interest and would either be repaid upon consummation of an initial business combination or, at the Sponsor s
discretion. In addition, up to of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into Private Placement Warrants of the Company
at a price of per warrant. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and outstanding under
the Working Capital Loans respectively. 

On April 1, 2024, the Company amended and restated
the Working Capital Loan to extend the maturity date thereunder to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) months after the closing of the Initial
Public Offering and (ii) the consummation of a Business Combination. The Company also increased the principal amount from to
 . 

On April 26, 2024, the Company further amended
and restated the Working Capital Loan and extended the maturity date thereunder to the earlier of (i) forty-two (42) months after the
closing of the Initial Public Offering and (ii) the effective date of a Business Combination. 

Promissory Note Extension Loans 

In connection with the First Extension, the Sponsor
agreed to loan the Company an amount equal to the lesser of (i) per public share multiplied by the number of public shares then
outstanding and (ii) , for each calendar month beginning on April 30, 2023 until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business
Combination and (ii) the Company s liquidation (each, a Contribution ). 

In connection with the first Contribution, on
May 4, 2023, the Company issued a convertible promissory note to the Sponsor with a principal amount up to million for working capital
expenses (as discussed in Note 1). The convertible promissory note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of the
consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination, or the liquidation of the Company. If the Company does not consummate
an initial Business Combination by the First Extended Date, the convertible promissory note will be repaid only from funds held outside
of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Upon maturity, the outstanding principal of the convertible
promissory note may be converted into warrants identical to the Private Placement Warrants, at a price of per warrant, at the option
of the Sponsor. 

On April 26, 2024, in connection with the Second
Extension Meeting, the Company issued a promissory note to the Sponsor in the amount of million in connection with the Second Extension
Contributions. As of September 30, 2024, has been drawn on this note. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
the Sponsor has advanced and respectively to the Company. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, extension
contributions of and respectively were due from Sponsor, which is not included in the outstanding balance of the extension loans. 

The Company determined that the conversion option
on the convertible promissory notes should be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative in accordance with ASC 815. Although the exercise
price of the underlying warrants was lesser than the closing price of the Company s Class A ordinary shares as of September 30,
2024, the Company believes that the likelihood of the Sponsor s exercise of the option to convert the Promissory Notes to warrants
is de minimis. As a result, the Company recorded zero liability related to the conversion option. 

Administrative Support Agreement 

Commencing on the date of the Initial Public
Offering, the Company has paid the Sponsor per month for utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided
to the members of the Company s management team, which included payment of per month to our former Chief Financial
Officer and Executive Vice President of Business Development. Upon completion of the initial business combination or the
Company s liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. On July 1, 2022 the Company amended the
administrative support agreement with the Sponsor from per month to per month. The agreement was amended again on
September 25, 2024 with an effective date of May 1, 2024 to increase the fees from to per month. For the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred and respectively in Sponsor administrative fees. The Company
incurred and respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in Sponsor administrative fees.

warrants
issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (the of Public Warrants and the of Private Placement Warrants)
in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815- 40 Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity .
Such guidance provides that, because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded
as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classifies each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement
at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair
value recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of income. 

Additionally, certain adjustments to the settlement
amount of the Private Placement Warrants are based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed 
option as defined under ASC 815-40, and thus the Private Placement Warrants are not considered indexed to the Company s own stock
and not eligible for an exception from derivative accounting. 

The accounting treatment of derivative financial
instruments requires that the Company record a derivative liability upon issuance of the warrants at the closing of the Initial Public
Offering. Accordingly, the Company classified each warrant as a liability at its fair value. The Public Warrants were allocated a portion
of the proceeds from the issuance of the Units equal to its fair value determined with the assistance of a professional independent valuation
firm. The warrant liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability
is adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of income. The Company
reassesses the classification of the warrants at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the
period, the warrants will be reclassified as of the date of the event that causes the reclassification.

days after the completion of an initial public offering provided that the Company has an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary share issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current
prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or
blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder (or holders are permitted to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under
certain circumstances as a result of (i) the Company s failure to have an effective registration statement by the 60 th 
business day after the closing of the initial business combination or (ii) a notice of redemption described under Redemption
of warrants when the price per share of Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds ). The Company has agreed that as soon
as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of its initial business combination, the Company will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC and have an effective registration statement covering the Class A ordinary share
issuable upon exercise of the warrants and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60
business days after the closing of the Company s initial business combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those
Class A ordinary share until the warrants expire or are redeemed. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered
under the Securities Act in accordance with the above requirements, the Company will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants
on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to
issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or
qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding
the above, if the Company s Class A ordinary share are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities
exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company
may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance
with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect
a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register
or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. 

The warrants have an exercise price of 
per share, subject to adjustments, and will expire after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption
or liquidation. In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary share or equity-linked securities for capital raising
purposes in connection with the closing of the initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than 
per share of Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors
and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor
or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from
such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest or dividend thereon, available for the funding of the
initial business combination on the date of the consummation of the initial business combination (net of redemptions) and (z) the volume
weighted average trading price of Class A ordinary share during the trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day
on which the Company consummates the initial business combination (such price, the Market Value is below per share,
the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the
Newly Issued Price, and the and per share redemption trigger prices described under Redemption of warrants for
Class A ordinary share and Redemption of warrants for cash will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be
equal to and of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, respectively. 

The Private Placement Warrants are identical to
the Public Warrants, except that, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable
by the Company, (ii) they (including the Class A ordinary share issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain
limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the Sponsor until 30 days after the completion of the initial business combination,
(iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) are subject to registration rights. 

If a tender offer, exchange or redemption offer
shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of the Class A ordinary share and upon completion of such offer, the offeror owns
beneficially more than of the outstanding Class A ordinary share the holder of the warrant shall be entitled to receive the highest
amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a shareholder if such warrant had
been exercised, accepted such offer and all of the Class A ordinary share held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to the offer.
If less than of the consideration receivable by the holders of the Class A ordinary share in the applicable event is payable in the
form of common equity in the successor entity that is listed on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter
market, and if the holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following the public disclosure of the consummation
of the applicable event by the Company, the warrant price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference (but in no event less
than zero) of (i) the warrant price in effect prior to such reduction minus (ii) (A) the Per Share Consideration (as defined in the warrant
agreement) minus (B) the value of the warrant based on the Black-Scholes Warrant Value for a Capped American Call on Bloomberg Financial

The Company will not redeem the warrants as described
above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary share issuable upon exercise of
the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary share is available throughout the 30-day redemption
period. Any such exercise would not be on a cashless basis and would require the exercising warrant holder to pay the exercise price for
each warrant being exercised. 

Redemption of warrants when the price per share
of Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds : Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants: 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption; provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table set forth under Description of Securities Warrants Public Warrants based on the redemption date and the fair market value of Class A ordinary share (as defined below) except as otherwise described in Description of Securities Warrants Public Warrants in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K; and;

if the closing price of the Class A ordinary share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading Description of Securities Warrants Public Warrants Redemption Procedures Anti-dilution Adjustments in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K), the Private Placement Warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding public warrants, as described above. 

In no event will the Company be required to net
cash settle any warrant. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date and the Company liquidates the
funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they
receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly,
the warrants may expire worthless.

Private Placement Warrants

Public Warrants 

Private Placement Warrants 

The fair value of the Public Warrants issued in
connection with the Public Offering and Private Placement Warrants were initially measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation
model. The fair value of Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering have been measured based on the listed
market price of such warrants, a Level 1 measurement, since December 17, 2021, which was the date the Public Warrants detached from the
Units. The close price of the Public Warrants on the New York Stock Exchange was used as the primary input to the fair value of the Public
Warrants as of each relevant date subsequent to December 17, 2021. The measurement of the Public Warrants after the detachment of the
Public Warrants from the Units is classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market. The subsequent
measurements of the Private Placement Warrants after the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units are classified as Level 2 due
to the use of an observable market quote for a similar asset in an active market. 

Since fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the
trading volume for the public warrants has significantly reduced, as such the Company had reclassified the public warrants from Level
1 to Level 2 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants has subsequently been measured
by reference to the trading price of the Public Warrants, which is considered to be a Level 2 fair value measurement.

and growing cash flows. In particular, we will seek to identify companies provide the necessary products, equipment, services and technologies
to support the energy transition, without the need to have their business rely solely on a single type of technology. We believe our leadership
team s broad and diverse global network of transaction sources and relationships across a wide spectrum of renewable energy sectors
will allow us to effectively and efficiently identify and evaluate potential opportunities for our initial business combination. 

We intend to effectuate our initial business combination,
including the Sio Business Combination, using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement
Warrants, and our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. Our registration statement for the Initial Public Offering
became effective on October 26, 2021. We consummated the Initial Public Offering of 20,125,000 Units on October 29, 2021. Each Unit consisted
of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant, including the issuance of 2,625,000 Units as a result of the underwriter s
exercise of its over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant,
with each public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.
The Units were sold at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 201,250,000, and incurred 11,068,750
in underwriting fees (inclusive of 8,443,750 in deferred underwriting fees). 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial
Public Offering on October 29, 2021, we completed the closing of the Private Placement of an aggregate 10,156,250 Private Placement Warrants
at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of 10,156,250.

Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering,
the over-allotment and the Private Placement, 206,281,250 10.25 per unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial
Public Offering, the over-allotment and the Private Placement were placed in the Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust
Company acting as trustee. Such proceeds were invested in United States government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less
or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act, as determined by us, until February 2024, when the trustee liquidated such investments and moved the proceeds to an interest-bearing
demand deposit account. The proceeds will be held in such account until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and
(ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. 

On April 24, 2023, we held the First Extension
Meeting, pursuant to which our shareholders approved the First Extension, an amendment to the Articles to extend the date by which the
Company must complete initial business combination from April 29, 2023 to April 29, 2024 (or such earlier date as determined by our board
of directors and included in a public announcement). In connection therewith, the Sponsor agreed to loan us 160,000 for each calendar
month beginning on April 30, 2023 and ending on the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the date of the our liquidation
in accordance with the terms of the Extension, up to a maximum aggregate amount of 1.92 million. On May 4, 2023, we issued the First
Extension Note to the Sponsor with a principal amount up to 1.92 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Note has been fully drawn and
there were Trust Account deposits in connection with the First Extension Note, totaling 1.92 million. Pursuant to the First Extension
Note, the Sponsor may convert the principal outstanding into Private Placement Warrants at 1.00 per warrant. As of September 30, 2024,
the Sponsor did not elect to convert. In connection with the vote to approve the First Extension, the holders of 11,151,163 Class A ordinary
shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.56 per share, for an
aggregate redemption amount of approximately 118 million, resulting in 8,973,837 public shares remaining. 

At the First Extension Meeting, the shareholders
also approved a proposal to provide the holders of the Class B ordinary shares with the right to convert such shares into Class A ordinary
shares on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of an initial business combination at the election of such holder. On April 28, 2023,
the Sponsor elected to convert 5,031,250 Class B ordinary shares held by it, which represented all of the Class B ordinary shares outstanding
into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis for no consideration. 

On April 26, 2024, the Company had the Second
Extension Meeting to vote on another amendment to its amended and restated articles and memorandum of association to extend the deadline
by which it has to complete an initial business combination from April 29, 2024 to April 29, 2025, the Second Extension. In connection
with the vote to approve the Second Extension, the holders of 2,683,126 public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for
cash at a redemption price of approximately 11.35 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 30.4 million, resulting
in 6,290,711 public shares outstanding. In connection with the Second Extension Meeting, the Company issued a Second Extension Note to
the Sponsor in the amount of 1.08 million in connection with the Second Extension Contributions. The Second Extension Note will fund
extension deposit of 90,000 for each calendar month beginning on April 30, 2024 until April 29, 2025. 

Our management and our board of directors have
broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, the over-allotment and the
sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a business combination. 

If we have not completed our initial business
combination by the Extended Date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably
possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the
aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously
released to us (less taxes payable and up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then-outstanding
public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval
of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in any operations nor
generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since February 12, 2021 (inception) have been organizational activities, the Initial
Public Offering and identifying and evaluating a target company for an initial business combination and activities in connection with
the Sio Business Combination. and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering. We have not generated any operating revenues
until after completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest or dividend
income on the investments held in the Trust Account. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no
material adverse change has occurred since the date of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Since the Initial Public
Offering, we have incurred increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing
compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
we had a net income of 299,080, which consists of general and administrative expenses of 275,154, change in fair value of derivative
warrant liabilities of 202,187, offset by a gain on cash held in Trust Account of 776,421. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023,
we had a net income of 1,362,105, which consists of general and administrative expenses of 547,392, offset by a change in fair value
of derivative warrant liabilities of 683,395 and a gain on investments held in Trust Account of 1,226,102. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we had a net income of 2,289,894, which consists of general and administrative expenses of 1,405,024, offset by a change in fair value
of derivative warrant liabilities of 404,375 and a gain on cash and investments held in Trust Account of 3,290,543. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
we had a net income of 3,350,580, which consists of general and administrative expenses of 1,574,892 and a change in fair value of derivative
warrant liabilities of 202,188, offset by a gain on investments held in Trust Account of 4,723,284. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
cash used in operating activities was 752,489. This was made up of a net income of 2,289,894, changes in operating assets and liabilities
of 652,535, offset by a decrease in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of 404,375, and a 3,290,543 gain on cash and investments
held in Trust Account. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
cash used in operating activities was 203,494. This was made up of a net income of 3,350,580, changes in operating assets and liabilities
of 1,371,398, offset by a decrease in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities of 202,188, and a 4,723,284 gain on investments
held in Trust Account. 

We intend to use substantially all of the funds
held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, excluding deferred underwriting commissions,
to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. To the extent that
our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete a Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held
in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions
and pursue our growth strategies. 

We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust
Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel
to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate
documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. 

Going Concern Considerations 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 2,184
in cash and no cash equivalents outside the Trust Account. Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant
costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. Management s plans to address this need for capital through completing
the Sio Business Combination and the IPO Working Capital Loan. The Company cannot assure that its plans to consummate an initial business
combination will be successful. If the Company s estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due
diligence, and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient
funds available to operate its business prior to an initial business combination. The liquidation deadline for the Company is also currently
within the next twelve months if an initial business combination is not consummated. The Company cannot assure that its plans to consummate
the Sio Business Combination or any initial business combination will be successful. 

The Company
is a Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation with a currently scheduled liquidation date of April 29, 2025. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to consummate an initial business combination by April 29, 2025 (or such date as such deadline may
be extended). In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standard Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , management has determined that if the Company
is unable to complete an initial business combination and raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs and since the mandatory
liquidation deadline is less than 12 months away, there is substantial doubt that the Company will operate as a going concern. No adjustments
have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after the Extended Date. These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or
the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Commitments and Contractual Obligations 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. 

Registration Rights 

The holders of Founder Shares and Private Placement
Warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the IPO Working Capital Loan or the Extension Notes (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable
upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants issued upon conversion of such loans), are entitled to registration rights pursuant
to a registration rights agreement signed in connection with the Initial Public Offering. These holders are entitled to certain demand
and piggyback registration rights. 

The holders of these securities are entitled to
make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. These holders will be entitled to certain demand
and piggyback registration rights. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration
statements. 

Underwriting Agreement 

We granted the underwriter a 45-day option from
the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 2,625,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if
any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On October 29, 2021, the underwriter fully
exercised its over-allotment option. 

Additionally, the underwriter is entitled to a
deferred underwriting discount of 4 of the gross proceeds of the base portion of the Public Offering and a deferred underwriting discount
of 5.5 of the gross proceeds per over-allotment unit upon the completion of the Company s initial business combination. 

On June 8, 2023, the Company modified the terms
of UBS s deferred underwriting discount, which is effective as of the closing of the Sio Business Combination. 

Administrative Support Agreement 

The Company agreed to pay the Sponsor a
total of 15,000 per month, commencing on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering, for utilities, secretarial and
administrative support services provided to members of the management team, which amount was decreased to 5,000 per month in July
2022. The agreement was amended again on September 25, 2024 with an effective date of May 1, 2024 to increase the fees from 5,000
to 15,000 per month. Upon completion of the initial business combination or the liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred 45,000 and 15,000 respectively in Sponsor
administrative fees. The Company incurred 95,000 and 45,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
in Sponsor administrative fees. 

Due to Related Party

for working capital loans (as amended and restated, the IPO Working Capital Loan ). If the Company completes an initial business
combination, the Company would repay the IPO Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. In
the event that an initial business combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account
to repay the IPO Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the IPO Working Capital Loans.
On April 1, 2024, the Company amended and restated the IPO Working Capital Loan to extend the maturity date thereunder to the earlier
of (i) thirty (30) months after the closing of the Initial Public Offering and (ii) the consummation of a Business Combination. The Company

Capital Loan and extended the maturity date thereunder to the earlier of (i) forty-two (42) months after the closing of the Initial Public
Offering and (ii) the effective date of a Business Combination. The IPO Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation
of an initial business combination or, at the lender s discretion, up to 1,500,000 of such IPO Working Capital Loans may be convertible
into Private Placement Warrants of the post-initial business combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant. As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023, the Company had 1,476,742 and 723,322 outstanding under the IPO Working Capital Loans.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible
Redemption 

All of the Class A ordinary shares sold as part
of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares in connection
with the Company s liquidation if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in
connection with certain amendments to the Company s Charter. In accordance with SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable
equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require
ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all Class A ordinary shares subject to
possible redemption have been classified outside of permanent equity. 

The Company recognizes changes in redemption value
immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each
reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional
paid in capital and accumulated deficit. 

Net Income Per Ordinary Share 

The Company complies with accounting and disclosure
requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share . Net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of ordinary share outstanding during the period. The Company has not considered the effect of the
warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and Private Placements to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the calculation of diluted
income per share, since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. As a result, diluted income per share
is the same as basic income per share for the period presented. 

The Company historically had two classes of ordinary
shares -- Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Upon the conversion event in April 2023 to convert the Class B ordinary
shares into Class A ordinary shares, the Company now have redeemable and non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares. Income and losses are
shared pro rata between the redeemable and non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares. Net income per share, basic and diluted for redeemable
Class A ordinary shares is calculated by dividing the pro rata allocation of net income to redeemable Class A ordinary shares for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 by the weighted average number of redeemable Class A ordinary shares outstanding
for the periods. Net income per share basic and diluted for non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares is calculated by dividing the pro rata
allocation of net income to non-redeemable ordinary shares or the for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 by the
weighted average number of non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares outstanding for the periods. Remeasurement associated with the redeemable
shares of Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. 

Derivative Instruments 

The Company does not use derivative instruments
to hedge its exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. Management evaluates all of the Company s financial instruments,
including issued warrants to purchase its Class A ordinary shares, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features
that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and ASC 815-15. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether
such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. 

The Company issued 10,062,500 Public Warrants
to purchase Class A ordinary shares to investors in the Company s Initial Public Offering and simultaneously issued 10,156,250 Private
Placement Warrants. All of the Company s outstanding warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40.
Accordingly, we recognize the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting
period. The liabilities are subject to re- measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized
in our consolidated statements of income. The Company initially utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the Public Warrants and
Private Placement Warrants at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of income.
Inherent in pricing models are assumptions and inputs used to arrive the fair value of the Public and Private Placement warrants. The
subsequent measurements of the Public Warrants after the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units on December 17, 2021 were classified
as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market under the ticker PHYT.WS. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2023, the trading volume for the public warrants has significantly reduced, as such the Company had reclassified the public warrants
from Level 1 to Level 2 as of September 30, 2024. The close price of the Public Warrant was used as the fair value of the Public Warrants
as of September 30, 2024. The Private Placement Warrants have a make-whole provision in place, which will enable them to have a fair value
similar to Public Warrants as of September 30, 2024. 

Both the Extension Notes and the IPO Working Capital
Loan (together, the Convertible Promissory Notes ), contain a conversion feature, for which upon maturity, the outstanding
principal of the Promissory Notes, at the option of the Sponsor, may be converted into warrants identical to the Private Placement capital
warrants. The Company determined that the conversion option should be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative in accordance with
ASC 815. Although the exercise price of the underlying warrants was lesser than the closing price of the Company s Class A ordinary
shares as of September 30, 2024, the Company believes that the likelihood of the Sponsor s exercise of the option to convert the
Promissory Notes to warrants is de minimis. As a result, the Company recorded zero liability related to the conversion option on the Promissory
Notes.

Cash (Investments) held in Trust Account 

Our portfolio of investments held in the Trust
Account was money market funds solely comprised of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities,
or a combination thereof, until February 2024 when those investments were liquidated and funds moved into an interest-bearing demand deposit.
The investments held in the Trust Account were classified as trading securities. Trading securities were presented on the balance sheet
at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of those securities were included
in gain on investments held in Trust Account on the statements of income. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account
were determined using available market information. 

On April 24, 2024, the Company amended the Trust
Agreement in order to align the Company s investments held in the Trust Account to permit the Trustee to hold the assets in the
Trust Account in an interest-bearing demand deposit account or cash until the earlier of the consummation of an initial business combination
or the Company s liquidation. On the same day, the Company instructed the Trustee to liquidate the investments held in the Trust
Account and move the funds to an interest-bearing demand deposit account, with Continental continuing to act as trustee. As a result,
following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants are no longer invested in U.S. government securities or money market funds. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

Refer to Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

JOBS Act 

On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups
Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain
reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and
are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies.
We elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting
standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements
as of public company effective dates. 

As an emerging growth company, we
are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial
reporting, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies, (iii) comply
with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a
supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation.
These exemptions will apply for a period of five (5) years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we otherwise
no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. 

Recent Developments 

On October 29, 2024, we received notice from the New York Stock Exchange that it would suspend the listing of the Class
A ordinary shares, Public Warrants and Units before market open on October 30, 2024 and commence delisting proceedings with respect to
such securities because its Listed Company Manual does not permit a special purpose acquisition company, such as the Company, to remain
listed for more than three years after its initial public offering. Following the suspension, our Class A ordinary shares, Public Warrants
and Units began trading on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbols PHYTF, PHYWF and PHYUF, 
respectively. 

On November 12, 2024,
we entered into an amendment to the Sio Business Combination Agreement with Sio, Sio Newco and Pyrophyte Newco, pursuant to which the
parties thereto agreed to extend the outside date from November 13, 2024 to December 31, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly
Report, as of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective,
due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as we experienced difficulty in the accounting and reporting
related to the existence of assets, the accounting and reporting for the completeness and accuracy of our liabilities and the corresponding
expenses, as well as the accounting for complex financial instruments, and related party transactions which we experienced and reported
as a material weakness in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result, we performed additional analysis
as deemed necessary to ensure that our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly,
management believes that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report present fairly in
all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
