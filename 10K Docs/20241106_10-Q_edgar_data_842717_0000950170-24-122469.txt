The Company evaluates the fair value and credit quality of its securities AFS portfolio no less than quarterly. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the majority of securities in an unrealized loss position were of investment grade; however, a portion of the portfolio does not have a third-party investment grade available. These ungraded securities were primarily subordinated debt instruments issued by bank holding companies and are classified as corporate bonds in the tables above. The Company evaluated the issuers of these individually, observing that each issuer had strong capital ratios and profitability thereby indicating limited exposure to asset quality or liquidity issues, which resulted in no identifiable credit losses. Investment securities with unrealized losses are generally attributable to changes in the interest rate environment since purchase and not as a result of permanent credit impairment. Contractual cash flows for mortgage backed securities and U.S. Treasury and agencies are guaranteed and/or funded by the U.S. government and government agencies. State and municipal securities showed no indication that the contractual cash flows would not be received when due. The Company does not intend to sell, nor does it believe that it will be required to sell, any of its impaired securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for credit losses ACL against the Company's securities AFS portfolio. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Restricted equity investments consiste d of stock in the FHLB (carrying value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively), stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond ("FRB") (carrying value of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively), and stock in the Bank s correspondent bank (carrying value of thousand at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023). Restricted equity investments are carried at cost. The Company also has various other equity investments, including an investment in a fintech company and limited partnerships, totaling million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company reports such investments at fair value if observable market transactions have occurred in similar securities, resulting in a new carrying value that is evaluated for impairment no less than quarterly. These impairment analyses may include quantitative and/or qualitative information obtained either directly from the investee, a third-party broker, or a third-party valuation firm. If a potential impairment has been identified, the carrying value of the investment would be written down to its estimated fair market value through a charge to earnings. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company identified potential impairment triggers related to one of its investments, mainly due to regulatory pressures on banks partnering with fintech companies in the banking-as-a-service sector. These pressures led some fintech companies to announce cost-saving measures and at least one to seek bankruptcy protection. As a result, the Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to value the Company's investment in a fintech company. This valuation resulted in an million impairment charge, recorded in fair value adjustments of other equity investments, to adjust the investment to its estimated fair market value during the second quarter of 2024. 

 14 

million an d million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are reported in other investments on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments do not have readily-determinable fair values, are generally reported at amortized cost, and are periodically evaluated for potential impairment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company sold million of its SBIC investments at a thousand loss, which is reported in other noninterest income.

Credit Quality Indicators The Company segments loans held for investment into risk categories based on relevant information about the expected ability of borrowers to repay debt, such as current financial information, historical payment performance, experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. Management assigns loan risk grades by a numerical system as an indication of credit quality of its portfolio of loans held for investment. The Company uses the following definitions for loan risk ratings and periodically evaluates the appropriateness of these ratings across its loan portfolio. Independent third-party loan reviews are periodically performed on the Company's loan portfolio and such reviews are used to validate management's determination of loan risk grades. Bank regulatory agencies also periodically review the Company's loan portfolio, including loan risk grades and may change a grade based on their judgment of the facts at the time of review.

 Regulatory Matters 
 On January 24, 2024, the Bank consented to the issuance of a consent order (the Consent Order with the OCC, the Bank's primary regulator. The Consent Order generally incorporates the provisions of the formal written agreement (the "Written Agreement") entered into between the Bank and the OCC on August 29, 2022, as well as adding new provisions. The Written Agreement principally concerned the Bank s fintech operations and required the Bank to continue enhancing its controls for assessing and managing the third-party, Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering, 
 37 

and information technology risks stemming from its fintech partnerships. The Consent Order adds time frames by which certain of the directives are required, requires the Bank to submit a strategic plan and a capital plan, and places further restrictions on the Company s fintech operations. The Consent Order also requires the Bank to maintain a leverage ratio of 10.0 and a total capital ratio of 13.0 , referred to as minimum capital ratios. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believes it has timely submitted the required documents under the Consent Order. Complete copies of the Written Agreement and the Consent Order are included as Exhibits 10.14 and 10.15, respectively, to the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 In connection with the requirements of the Consent Order, during 2024, the Company developed and submitted a three-year strategic plan. The strategic plan sets forth the Company s priorities, which include; 1) remediation and compliance with the Consent Order; 2) redefining its fintech business, including exiting fintech banking-as-a-service BaaS depository operations; 3) refocusing on core community banking; 4) enhancing its enterprise risk management and credit risk administration infrastructures; 5) achieving operational efficiency, and 6) building development and training infrastructure for its employees. The Company also submitted its annual capital plan for the Company and the Bank. The capital plan supports the strategic plan and forecasts capital needs based on the Company s proposed strategy. 
 Private Placements 
 On April 3, 2024 and June 13, 2024, the Company closed private placements in which it issued and sold shares of its common and preferred stock for gross proceeds of 150.0 million and 11.6 million, respectively (collectively, the "Private Placements"). At a special meeting of shareholders held June 20, 2024, the Company s shareholders approved various proposals, thus approving the conversion of the preferred shares issued in the Private Placements into shares of the Company s common stock. On June 28, 2024, all outstanding shares of the Company s Mandatorily Convertible Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the "Series B Common Stock") converted into shares of the Company s common stock. The outstanding shares of the Company s Mandatorily Convertible Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the Series C Preferred Stock ), remained outstanding at September 30, 2024. On July 11, 2024, the holder of Series C Preferred Stock received the required regulatory non-objection to exchange the Series C Preferred Stock for common stock as stipulated in the Private Placements. The Company expects the exchange of the Series C Preferred Stock for shares of the Company's common stock will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2024. Capital proceeds received, net of issuance costs, from the Private Placements totaled 152.1 million. 
 The Private Placements also included the issuance of warrants for 6,549 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and warrants for 1,441 shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Each warrant can be exercised to purchase shares at a price of 10 thousand per share. On June 28, 2024, the warrants for Series B Preferred Stock converted to warrants for common stock, and the warrants for Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding pending exchange of the Series C Preferred Stock. The conversion rate on the warrants from preferred stock to common stock was 4,000 shares of common per preferred share. As of September 30, 2024, there were warrants outstanding to purchase 26,195,999 common shares. Of these, warrants to purchase 21,635,999 common shares have an exercise price of 2.50 per share, and warrants to purchase 4,560,000 common shares have an exercise price of 2.39 per share. The warrants have 5-year terms and expire April 3, 2029. 
 The issued warrants have been accounted for as freestanding financial instruments and classified as equity in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The warrants were deemed freestanding because they are (1) legally detachable and separately exercisable from the common or preferred shares, as applicable, issued in the Private Placements, (2) only exercisable into shares of the Company s stock, with no obligation for the Company to transfer any asset in settlement, and (3) do not obligate the Company to issue a variable number of shares. The warrants are classified as equity because they are freestanding and (1) the Company has sufficient authorized and unissued shares available for issuance, (2) the warrant agreements specify a fixed number of shares to be issued upon exercise, and (3) there are no provisions requiring cash payments by the Company in any "top-off" or "make-whole" situations or for failure to make timely filings with the SEC. 
 The Company intends to use the capital from the Private Placements to propel its near-term strategic initiatives, which include repositioning business lines, supporting organic growth, and further enhancing the Bank s capital levels, including compliance with the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Bank s Consent Order. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Bank s capital ratios exceeded these minimum capital ratios. 
 38 

Restatement 
 On October 31, 2023, the Company and the Audit Committee of its board of directors, after consultation with the Company s independent registered public accounting firm and the OCC, determined that certain specialty finance loans that, as previously disclosed, were placed on nonaccrual, reserved for, or charged off in the interim periods ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 should have been reported as nonaccrual, reserved for, or charged off in earlier periods. On November 14, 2023, the Company filed amendments to its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 to restate the consolidated financial statements included therein. Following the restatements, the Company has partially recovered and, in some cases, fully recovered amounts from certain specialty finance loans previously charged off. See Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 The Company does not believe that the restatements reflect any significant financial impact on the Company's financial condition as of September 30, 2024, or any trends in the Company's business or its prospects. The consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect the effects of the aforementioned restatement for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 General 
 There were no changes to the Critical Accounting Policies disclosed in Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Certain amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current year presentations. The reclassifications had no effect on net income, net income per share, total assets, total liabilities, or stockholders equity as previously reported. 
 Comparison of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 Total assets were 2.94 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 172.9 million from 3.12 billion as of December 31, 2023. Most of this decrease was attributable to a decline in loans held for investment, which decreased 250.5 million to 2.18 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 2.43 billion as of December 31, 2023. The Company previously announced it would exit its fintech BaaS operations. The Company has purposely and selectively reduced assets to meet the liquidity needs of exiting its fintech BaaS operations, which is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2024. The allowance for credit losses ("ACL") declined 10.4 million to 25.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from 35.9 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to a 9.4 million charge-off as a result of the previously noted specialty finance loan's reclassification to loans held for sale in the second quarter of 2024 and lower reserve needs due to loan portfolio balance reductions, partially offset by higher specific reserves for certain purchased loans. 
 Total deposits as of September 30, 2024 were 2.35 billion, a net decrease of 219.5 million from December 31, 2023. The decrease in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to a decrease of 264.4 million of interest-bearing fintech-related deposits. Total deposits related to fintech relationships decreased by 278.4 million to 187.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from 465.9 million as of December 31, 2023, and represented 8.0 and 18.2 of total deposits as of the same respective dates. Fintech BaaS deposits decreased by 307.3 million to 63.7 million as of September 30, 2024 from 371.0 million as of December 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, deposits, excluding fintech-related and brokered deposits, increased 143.5 million. 
 Total stockholders equity increased by 150.4 million to 336.3 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 186.0 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to the closing of the Private Placements in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of 946 thousand, or 0.01 per diluted common share, compared to a net loss of 41.4 million, or 2.18) per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company executed an agreement to sell a nonperforming specialty finance loan to a third party, reclassifying the loan from loans held for investment to loans held for sale in the same period at its estimated fair value. Upon reclassification, the Company recorded a charge-off of substantially all of the reserve held on the loan, which was provisioned for in prior years. In the third quarter, the sale was completed upon the receipt of all contractual amounts due. Income before income taxes of 1.5 million for the 
 39 

quarter included a 6.2 million recovery of credit losses resulting primarily from an 8.4 million recovery upon the completion of the specialty finance loan sale. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of 13.4 million, or 0.35) per diluted common share, compared to a net loss of 46.0 million, or 2.43) per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a second quarter 6.7 million non-cash, after-tax negative fair value adjustment recorded for an equity investment in a fintech company, partially offset by a 6.6 million after-tax recovery of credit losses on a specialty finance loan that was sold in the third quarter upon the receipt of all contractual amounts due. The third quarter 2023 loss included a non-cash, after-tax goodwill impairment charge of 26.8 million, which was the entirety of the goodwill balance, and a 4.7 million after-tax settlement reserve for the now-settled Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP litigation assumed in the 2019 acquisition of Virginia Community Bankshares, Inc VCB ). 
 The net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included 282 thousand and 3.5 million, respectively, of after tax-costs incurred for professional services related to regulatory remediation efforts in connection with the Consent Order, compared to 2.9 million and 5.7 million, respectively, of after tax-costs incurred for the same periods in 2023 in connection with the Written Agreement. 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income is the amount by which interest earned on interest-earning assets exceeds the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities and is the Company s primary revenue source. Net interest income is thereby affected by overall balance sheet size, changes in interest rates, and changes in the mix of investments, loans, deposits, and borrowings. The Company s principal interest-earning assets are loans to businesses, real estate investors, and individuals, and investment securities. Interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of negotiable order of withdrawal and savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta FHLB advances. A common net interest income measure is net interest margin. Net interest margin represents the difference between interest income and interest expense calculated as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.

The following table presents the average balance sheets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Also shown are the amounts of interest earned on interest-earning assets, with related tax-equivalent yields, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, with related rates, as well as a volume and rate analysis of changes in net interest income for the periods stated.

Average interest-earning assets were 2.80 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.04 billion for the same period of 2023, a 242.7 million decrease. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower average balances of loans held for investment and securities, which decreased 229.5 million and 36.3 million, respectively, partially offset by higher average balances of interest-earning deposits in other banks. Total interest income (on a taxable equivalent basis) decreased 3.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from the same period of 2023, primarily due to lower average balances of interest-earning assets. Lower loan yields in the 2024 period were primarily attributable to lower relative average balances of variable rate commercial and industrial loans, reversal of interest income on loans moved to nonaccrual, reversal of interest income for other loan adjustments, and lower accretion of purchase accounting adjustments (discounts) on acquired loans. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included accretion of discounts on acquired loans of 311 thousand and 624 thousand, respectively. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities were 2.12 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.35 billion for the same period of 2023, a 232.9 million decrease. Interest expense decreased by 170 thousand to 
 41 

20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.79 for the third quarter of 2024 from 3.45 for the third quarter of 2023, while total cost of funds was 3.09 and 2.73 for the same respective periods. Higher cost of funds in the 2024 period was primarily due to higher rates on time deposits, particularly brokered time deposits the Company began issuing late in the first quarter of 2023 to increase liquidity in response to financial industry events. Interest expense in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 included the amortization of fair value adjustments (premium) on assumed time deposits of 70 thousand and 160 thousand, respectively, which was a reduction to interest expense. 
 Net interest income (on a taxable equivalent basis) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 19.1 million compared to 22.2 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 3.1 million. Net interest margin was 2.74 and 2.92 for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accretion and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments had a 6 and 11 basis point positive effect on net interest margin for the same respective periods. 
 The following table presents the average balance sheets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Also shown are the amounts of interest earned on interest-earning assets, with related tax-equivalent yields, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, with related rates, as well as a volume and rate analysis of changes in net interest income for the periods stated.

Average interest-earning assets were 2.88 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.05 billion for the same period of 2023, a 168.4 million decrease. This decrease was primarily attributable to declines in average balances of loans held for investment and securities, which decreased 155.6 million and 44.1 million, respectively, partially offset by higher average balances of interest-earning deposits in other banks and loans held for sale. Total interest income (on a taxable equivalent basis) decreased 3.5 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 from the same period of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower average balances on loans held for investment, in addition to lower accretion of purchase accounting adjustments (discounts) on acquired loans. Interest income on loans held for investment for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 included 671 thousand of interest received as a result of the payoff of a nonaccrual loan, which had a 4 and 3 basis point positive effect on the yield on loans held for investment and net interest margin, respectively. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included accretion of discounts on acquired loans of 915 thousand and 1.8 million, respectively. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities were 2.25 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.29 billion for the same period of 2023, a 37.7 million decrease. Interest expense increased by 8.3 million to 62.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.18 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while cost of funds were 3.04 and 2.44 for the same respective periods. Higher cost of funds in the 2024 period was primarily due to higher market interest rates and a shift in the mix of average interest-bearing liabilities, partially to higher cost brokered funding sources. Interest expense in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 included the amortization of fair value adjustments (premium) on assumed time deposits of 248 thousand and 666 thousand, respectively, which was a reduction to interest expense. 
 Net interest income (on a taxable equivalent basis) was 59.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 71.4 million for the same period in 2023. Net interest margin was 2.76 and 3.12 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accretion and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments had a 6 basis point and 11 basis point positive effect on net interest margin for the same respective periods. 
 Provision for Credit Losses. The Company recorded a recovery of credit losses of 6.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of 11.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The recovery of credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 was 4.1 million compared to a provision for credit losses of 19.6 million for the same period in 2023. The recovery of credit losses in the 2024 periods was primarily attributable to an 8.4 million recovery from the sale of the previously mentioned specialty finance loan and lower reserve needs due to loan portfolio balance reductions, partially offset by higher specific reserves for certain purchased loans. Provision for credit losses in the 2023 periods was primarily attributable to specific reserves on the previously reported group of specialty finance loans, partially offset by a recovery of credit losses on lower balances of unfunded loan commitments.

The decline in MSR income was primarily due to negative fair value adjustments in the 2024 periods, arising from lower future interest rate expectations, and a 1.0 million third quarter of 2024 loss on the sale of a portion of the Company's portfolio of MSRs. The decline in other noninterest income in the 2024 periods compared to the same periods of 2023 was primarily attributable to a decline in income from fintech BaaS deposit partnerships. This decline was also attributable to a decline in income from SBIC investments as the Company sold the majority of these small business investment companies ("SBIC") in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Lower gain on sale of guaranteed government loans in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to the exit of the majority of the Company's guaranteed government lending team, which aligns with the Company s enhanced focus on lending opportunities within its core geographic market. Noninterest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included an 8.5 million non-cash, negative fair value adjustment of an equity investment the Company holds in a fintech company. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, other noninterest income included 831 thousand and 2.5 million, respectively, from fintech lending partnerships, compared to 821 thousand and 2.3 million for the same periods in 2023. The Company is currently evaluating these partnerships and, as a result, anticipates a decline in noninterest income associated with fintech lending partnerships beginning in 2025.

Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, the ESOP litigation settlement charge, and regulatory remediation expenses, noninterest expense decreased 1.9 million and 3.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. Salaries and employee benefits expense in third quarter of 2024 reflected lower head count, primarily in the Bank's GGL and compliance areas, and lower health insurance expense compared to the same respective period of 2023. Lower legal and regulatory filings expenses in the 2024 periods were primarily the result of reduced legal costs associated with the VCB ESOP litigation. Lower other contractual services and regulatory remediation expenses in the 2024 period were due to the reduction in the use of third-party resources in the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering BSA/AML area, as the Bank completes certain requirements under the Consent Order and exits its fintech BaaS operations. Higher audit fees in the first nine months of 2024 were primarily due to outsourced internal audits and assessments related to fintech operations. Higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance expense in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to changes in the Bank's insurance assessment rate. Other noninterest expense in the 2024 periods included approximately 940 thousand of excise taxes related to the surrender of bank owned life insurance policies in the period. 
 Income Tax Expense . Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 599 thousand compared to an income tax benefit of 4.7 million for the same period of 2023, resulting in effective income tax rates of 38.8 and 10.2 , respectively. Income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 424 thousand compared to income tax benefit of 5.3 million for the same period in 2023, resulting in effective income tax rates of 3.1 and 10.4 for the same respective periods. The higher effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the vesting of restricted stock awards, where the fair value of the underlying stock at the time of vesting was lower than the fair value previously recognized for financial reporting purposes. The lower effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to 2.0 million of tax expense recognized in the second quarter of 2024 upon surrendering bank owned life insurance policies. Taxes on such earnings were previously permanently deferred but became subject to tax upon the surrender of the policies. The effective tax rates in the 2023 periods were primarily attributable to the goodwill impairment charge of 26.8 million, which had no tax effect, thus resulting in a lower income tax benefit. 
 Analysis of Financial Condition 
 Loan Portfolio. The Company makes loans to commercial entities and to individuals. Loan terms vary as to interest rate, repayment, and collateral requirements based on the type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Credit risk tends to be geographically concentrated in that a majority of the loans are to borrowers located in the markets served by the Company. All loans are underwritten within specific lending policy guidelines that are designed to maximize the Company s profitability within an acceptable level of business risk.

The current lending environment for commercial real estate CRE loans has heightened risk due to a higher interest rate environment. Potential negative impacts include higher debt service burdens for floating rate loans and fixed rate loans that mature and require renewal or refinancing. Collateral values overall may be impaired by higher capitalization rates and also pose risks for refinancing maturing loans. In addition, certain CRE collateral types have experienced declining occupancy, demand, and rental rates, which could potentially lead to material declines in property level economics and borrowers' ability to service their debt. 
 In response to the heightened risk, earlier in 2024 the Bank s credit policy and risk committee conducted a targeted exam of certain of the Bank s loan types, including office loans, to confirm its internal risk ratings. In addition, the Bank s credit administration department led by its Chief Credit Officer performs a periodic analysis of emerging trends by geography where the Bank has the largest concentrations by CRE property type. The analysis includes all real estate property types and geographic markets represented in the loan portfolio. This analysis is provided to the board of directors to assess whether the CRE lending strategy and risk appetite continue to be appropriate, considering changes in local market conditions and the Bank s exposure to collateral type concentrations. Also, concentration limits by real estate collateral type are approved and monitored by the board of directors. As of September 30, 2024, all limits are in compliance.

Allowance for Credit Losses . In determining the adequacy of the Company s ACL, management makes estimates based on facts available at the time the ACL is determined. Such estimation requires significant judgment at the time made. Management believes that the Company s ACL was adequate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There can be no assurance, however, that adjustments to the ACL will not be required in the future. Changes in the economic assumptions underlying management s estimates and judgments; adverse developments in the economy, on a national basis or in the Company s market area; and changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers are criteria, among others, that could increase the level of the ACL required, resulting in charges to the provision for credit losses for loans. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Bank's ACL and may require an increase in the ACL or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on their judgment of the facts at the time of their review that may differ than that of management. 
 The following table presents an analysis of the change in the ACL by loan type as of the dates and for the periods stated.

In the second quarter of 2024, the Company executed an agreement to sell a nonperforming specialty finance loan to a third party, reclassifying the loan from loans held for investment to loans held for sale in the same period at its estimated fair value. Upon reclassification, the Company recorded a charge-off of substantially all of the reserve held on the loan, which was provisioned for in prior years. In the third quarter, the sale was completed upon the receipt of all contractual amounts due, and pursuant to the note sale agreement, the Company recorded an 8.4 million recovery of credit losses. 
 The ACL includes specific reserves for individually evaluated loans and a general allowance applicable to all loan categories; however, management has allocated the ACL by loan type to provide an indication of the relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. The allocation is an estimate and should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs will occur in these amounts, or that the allocation indicates future trends, and does not restrict the usage of the allowance for any specific loan or category. The following table presents the allocation of the ACL by loan category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans as of the dates stated.

Nonperforming loans, which include nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest, decreased 31.0 million from December 31, 2023 to 32.1 million as of September 30, 2024. This decline primarily reflects the sale of the previously noted specialty finance loan, which had a December 31, 2023 carrying value of 32.8 million. 
 The remaining purchase accounting adjustments (discounts) related to loans acquired by the Company were 4.2 million and 5.1 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Investment Securities. The investment portfolio is used as a source of interest income, credit risk diversification, and liquidity, as well as to provide collateral for borrowings. Securities in the investment portfolio classified as securities AFS may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the security's prepayment risk, general liquidity needs, such as funding loans and deposits, and other similar factors, and are carried at estimated fair value. The fair value of the Company s AFS investment securities portfolio was 314.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.3 million from 321.1 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to the sale of several mortgage backed securities and normal principal amortization, partially offset by year-to-date unrealized gains. As a result of elevated market interest rates, the Company s portfolio of AFS securities had an unrealized loss of approximately 44.7 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the majority of the investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated as investment grade by a leading rating agency. Investment grade securities are judged to have a low risk of default. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, securities with a fair value of 273.0 million and 35.9 million, respectively, were pledged to secure the Bank s borrowing facility with the FHLB. 
 The Company reviews its AFS investment securities portfolio for potential credit losses at least quarterly. AFS investment securities with unrealized losses are generally a result of pricing changes due to changes in the current interest rate environment and not as a result of permanent credit impairment. The Company does not intend to sell, nor does it believe that it will be required to sell, any of its impaired AFS securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost. No ACL has been recognized for AFS securities as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Restricted equity investments consisted of stock in the FHLB (carrying basis 11.3 million and 12.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively), stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the "FRB") (carrying value of 9.2 million and 5.9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively), and stock in the Company s correspondent bank (carrying value of 468 thousand at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023). Restricted equity investments are carried at cost. 
 The Company also has various other equity investments, including an investment in a fintech company and limited partnerships, totaling 4.5 million and 12.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company reports such investments at fair value if observable market transactions have occurred in similar securities, resulting in a new carrying value that is evaluated for impairment no less than quarterly. These impairment analyses may include quantitative and/or qualitative information obtained either directly from the investee, a third-party broker, or a third-party valuation firm. If a potential impairment has been identified, the carrying value of the investment would be written down to its estimated fair market value through a charge to earnings. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company identified potential impairment triggers related to one of its investments, mainly due to regulatory pressures on banks partnering with fintech companies in the BaaS sector. These pressures led some fintech companies to announce cost-saving measures and at least one to seek bankruptcy protection. As a result, the Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to value the Company's investment in a fintech company. This valuation resulted in an 8.5 million impairment charge, recorded in fair value adjustments of other equity investments, to adjust the investment to its estimated fair market in the second quarter of 2024. 
 The following table presents the amortized cost of the investment portfolio by contractual maturities, as well as the weighted average yields for each of the maturity ranges as of and for the period stated. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Deposits. The principal sources of funds for the Company are deposits, including transaction accounts (demand deposits and money market accounts), time deposits, and savings accounts, of customers in the Company s primary geographic market area. Such customers provide the Bank a source of fee income and cross-marketing opportunities and are generally a lower cost source of funding for the Bank. 
 49 

Fintech-related deposits are sourced from fintech partnerships and in recent history have been a significant source of deposits for the Company. Fintech BaaS deposits comprise a significant portion of the Company s fintech-related deposits. The Company is exiting its fintech BaaS operations and expects to be fully exited by the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Brokered deposit balances are sourced through intermediaries and are an unsecured source of funding for the Bank. Brokered deposits were added throughout 2023 to enhance liquidity in light of financial industry events that began in March 2023 and in anticipation of the exit of the Company's fintech BaaS operations. Brokered deposits represented approximately 18.3 and 20.1 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and were all time deposits at September 30, 2024. The Bank has a liquidity management program, with oversight of the Bank s asset and liability committee (the ALCO that sets forth guidelines for the desired maximum level of brokered deposits, which is 20.0 of total deposits. As noted, the Company issued brokered deposits as a liquidity management tool in light of industry events and the exit of its fintech BaaS operations, and for these reasons, brokered deposit levels approximated the high-end of the guideline at September 30, 2024. In recent quarters, the Company has reduced levels of brokered deposits and expects to continue to reduce levels in future periods to a level of 10.0 or less of total deposits. As certain brokered deposits have multiple-year terms, the Company expects brokered deposits to be a funding source for several years. The ALCO monitors brokered deposit concentrations as part of its liquidity risk management program. 
 Total deposits decreased 219.5 million from 2.57 billion as of December 31, 2023 to 2.35 billion as of September 30, 2024, as: 
 Deposits, excluding fintech-related and brokered deposits, increased 143.5 million from approximately 1.58 billion as of December 31, 2023 to approximately 1.73 billion as of September 30, 2024; 

Fintech-related deposits decreased 278.4 million from approximately 465.9 million as of December 31, 2023 to approximately 187.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Of the decline, fintech BaaS deposits decreased 307.3 million from December 31, 2023, and represent approximately 3 of total deposits at September 30, 2024. Partially offsetting the decline in fintech BaaS deposits were 28.9 million of increased fintech corporate deposits; 

Brokered deposits decreased 85.0 million from approximately 515.5 million as of December 31, 2023 to approximately 430.5 million as of September 30, 2024. 

As a result of the Consent Order, subsequent to the date of the order, the Bank is prohibited from soliciting, accepting, renewing, or rolling over any brokered deposits, except in compliance with certain applicable restrictions under federal law, while subject to the Consent Order. In response and pursuant to 12 USC 1831f, 12 CFR 337.6(c) and 12 CFR 303.243(a), the Bank submitted to the FDIC an application for a waiver of the prohibition on the acceptance, renewal, or rollover of brokered deposits by an adequately capitalized insured depository institution. During the third quarter, the Bank received approval from the FDIC allowing the Bank to accept, renew, and rollover brokered deposits. The approval is for a six-month period and in the amount of maturities during this period. The Bank expects to file another application for waiver of this prohibition in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Estimated uninsured deposits totaled approximately 402.0 million as of September 30, 2024, or 16.8 of total deposits, compared to 573.9 million, or 22.3 of total deposits, as of December 31, 2023. Excluding fintech BaaS deposits, estimated uninsured deposits were 16.7 and 18.2 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Approximately 19.6 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 were composed of noninterest-bearing demand deposits compared to 19.7 as of December 31, 2023. In contrast, approximately 44.1 and 34.8 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were composed of time deposits.

FHLB advances are secured by collateral consisting of a blanket lien on qualifying pledged loans in the Company s residential, multi-family, and commercial real estate mortgage loan portfolios, as well as selected investment securities. FRB advances through the FRB Discount Window are secured by qualifying pledged commercial and industrial loans. 
 Total borrowings decreased 85.0 million from 275.0 million as of December 31, 2023 to 190.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company utilizes its FHLB line of credit, as an element of its liquidity management program, to maintain cash levels in the range of 3 -5 of total assets. In the year-to-date period, funding from the Private Placements contributed to the reduction of outstanding balances. Conversely, FHLB advances were used to meet the effects from fintech BaaS operation wind down, if and when the timing of such differed from loan payoffs/paydowns and asset liquidations. 
 Subordinated notes, net, totaled 39.8 million and 39.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The effective interest rate on the subordinated notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.69 and 5.61 , respectively, compared to 5.67 and 5.57 for the same periods in 2023. The Company's subordinated notes are comprised of an issuance in October 2019 maturing October 15, 2029 (the 2029 Notes and an issuance in May 2020 maturing June 1, 2030 (the 2030 Note ). The fixed rates on these subordinated notes transition to variable rates based on the Secured Overnight Funding Rate ("SOFR") roughly five years from issued date. On October 15, 2024, the rate on the 2029 Notes reset quarterly to the current three-month SOFR interest rate, which was 465.0 basis points, plus 433.5 basis points. On June 1, 2025, the rate on the 2030 Note will reset quarterly to the current three-month SOFR interest rate plus 587 basis points. 
 Liquidity . Liquidity is essential to the Company s business. The Company s liquidity could be impaired by unforeseen outflows of cash, including deposits, or the inability to access the capital and/or wholesale funding markets. This situation may arise due to circumstances that the Company may be unable to control, such as general market disruption, negative views about the Company or the financial services industry generally, or an operational problem that affects the Company or a third party. The Company s ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the markets in which they operate or other events. 
 51 

Deposits are the primary source of the Company s liquidity. Cash flow from amortizing or maturing assets also provides funding to meet the liquidity needs of the Company. Deposit sources are the Bank s core customers and through brokered deposit markets. These markets are accessed through brokers or through the IntraFi Network IntraFi ), of which the Bank is a member. IntraFi facilitates the Bank attaining brokered deposits via an on-line marketplace. The Bank utilizes IntraFi's reciprocal deposit services to offer its high-value customers access to FDIC insurance through IntraFi's network of banks. Partly through the use of the IntraFi reciprocal deposit program, the Company has reduced uninsured deposits to 402.0 million as of September 30, 2024 from 573.9 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company has established a formal liquidity contingency plan that provides guidelines for liquidity management. Pursuant to the Company s liquidity contingency plan, liquidity needs are forecasted based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet. In this forecast, the Company expects to maintain a liquidity cushion. Management then stress tests the Company s liquidity position under several different stress scenarios, from moderate to severe. Guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established. Management also monitors the Company s liquidity position on a day-to-day basis through daily cash monitoring and short- and long-term cash flow forecasting and believes its sources of liquidity are adequate to conduct the business of the Company.

Managing the Company's liquidity position through the exit of the fintech BaaS operations has required significant liquidity oversight. Management has utilized proceeds from the Private Placements, loan portfolio amortization and prepayments, in-market deposit growth, and, as needed, availability of secured borrowing capacity to offset the outflow of fintech BaaS deposits. Fintech BaaS deposits have declined 307.3 million since December 31, 2023, with 63.7 million remaining as of September 30, 2024. Management believes that it has the adequate sources of liquidity to meet the remainder of the wind down and brokered deposit maturities. 
 Uninsured deposits at September 30, 2024 were 402.0 million or 16.8 of total deposits. In the unlikely event that uninsured deposit balances leave the Bank over a short period of time, management could more than satisfy the demand with cash on-hand and FHLB and FRB borrowing capacity. 
 Capital. Capital adequacy is an important measure of financial stability and performance. The Company s objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient support the Company's strategic objectives. 
 Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, financial institutions must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. A financial institution's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 52 

Banks must hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.50 above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios for all ratios except the Tier 1 leverage ratio. If a banking organization dips into its capital conservation buffer, it is subject to limitations on certain activities, including payment of dividends, share repurchases, and discretionary compensation to certain officers. Additionally, regulators may place certain restrictions on dividends paid by banks. The total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to retained earnings of banks. 
 Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized; although, these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. 
 The Consent Order requires the Bank to achieve and maintain minimum capital requirements that are higher than those required for capital adequacy purposes. Specifically, the Bank is required to maintain a leverage ratio of 10.00 and a total capital ratio of 13.00 . As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Bank met these minimum capital ratios. Until such levels are maintained and the Consent Order has been lifted, the Bank is deemed to be less than well capitalized, thus adequately capitalized. 
 Because the Bank may not be deemed to be well capitalized while subject to the Consent Order, it could be required to pay higher insurance premiums to the FDIC, obtain approval prior to acquiring branches or opening new lines of business, and be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny such as limitations on asset growth. 
 As previously noted, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (referred herein as current expected credit losses or CECL effective January 1, 2023. Federal and state banking regulations allow financial institutions to irrevocably elect to phase-in the after-tax cumulative effect adjustment at adoption to retained earnings ("CECL Transitional Amount") over a three-year period. The three-year phase-in of the CECL Transitional Amount to regulatory capital is 25 , 50 , and 25 in 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. The Bank made this irrevocable election effective with its first quarter 2023 call report. 
 The following tables present the capital ratios to which banks are subject to be adequately and well capitalized, as well as the capital and capital ratios for the Bank as of the dates stated. Adequately capitalized ratios include the conversation buffer, if applicable. The following table also includes the capital adequacy ratios to which bank holding companies are subject. On January 1, 2024, the Company became subject to these ratios. Also presented are the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Consent Order for the Bank with the corresponding capital amounts for both the leverage ratio and the total capital ratio as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The CECL Transitional Amount was 8.1 million, of which 4.1 million and 2.0 million reduced the regulatory capital amounts and capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract and involve the same credit risk and evaluation as making a loan to a customer. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis, in a manner similar to that if underwriting a loan. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding loan commitments of 320.3 million and 480.8 million, respectively. Of these amounts, 106.3 million and 113.5 million were unconditionally cancelable at the sole discretion of the Company as of the same respective dates. 
 Conditional commitments are issued by the Company in the form of financial stand-by letters of credit, which guarantee payment to the underlying beneficiary (i.e., third party) if the customer fails to meet its designated financial obligation. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commitments under outstanding financial stand-by letters of credit totaled 11.9 million and 12.6 million, respectively. The credit risk of issuing stand-by letters of credit can be greater than the risk involved in extending loans to customers. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a recovery of credit losses for unfunded commitments of 200 thousand and 1.7 million, respectively, primarily due to lower balances of unfunded loan commitments. As of September 30, 2024, the reserve for unfunded commitments was 1.4 million compared to 3.1 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 As of and for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a recourse reserve of 520 thousand for estimated putbacks and transition costs as part of the sale of a portion of its MSR portfolio in the same period. This amount is included in the loss on sale of MSRs and other liabilities on the consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheet, respectively. The putbacks relate to industry-standard items, including prepayments or early delinquencies of the underlying mortgages, as well as any deficiencies in the underlying documentation, all of which are subject to term limits per the sales agreement. 
 The Company invests in various partnerships, limited liability companies, and small business investment company funds. Pursuant to these investments, the Company commits to an investment amount that may be fulfilled in future periods. At September 30, 2024, the Company had future commitments outstanding totaling 7.6 million related to these investments. 
 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 As a financial institution, the Company is exposed to various business risks, including interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from volatility in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricing and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers' ability to prepay loans and depositors' ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity, changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion, and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and other market-based index rates. The Company s goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk. Management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that the Bank maintains. The Company manages interest rate risk through an ALCO comprised of members of management. The ALCO is responsible for monitoring the Company s 
 54 

interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management, pursuant to policy guidelines approved by the board of directors. 
 The Company employs an independent consulting firm to model its interest rate sensitivity that uses a net interest income simulation model as its primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity. Assumptions for modeling are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet. For maturing assets, assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets. For maturing liabilities, assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources. Assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period. These assumptions also cover how management expects rates to change on non-maturity deposits such as interest checking, money market checking, savings accounts, as well as certificates of deposit. Based on inputs that include the current balance sheet, the current level of interest rates, and the developed assumptions, the model produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged. This is considered the base case. The model then simulates what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates. The rate simulations are performed for a two-year period and include rapid rate changes of down 100 basis points to 400 basis points and up 100 basis points to 400 basis points. The results of these simulations are then compared to the base case. 
 The following tables present the estimated change in net interest income under various rate change scenarios as of the dates presented. The scenarios assume rate changes occur instantaneous and in a parallel manner, which means the changes are the same on all points of the rate curve.

The change in the results of interest rate scenarios from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of the decrease in the Bank s fintech BaaS deposits. A significant portion of fintech BaaS deposits bear interest rates that adjust with changes in the federal funds rate making them highly sensitive to instantaneous interest rate changes. 
 The severity of the effect of instantaneous increases in interest rates as shown above is due to the assumption of the timing of pricing changes in the Company's interest-bearing liabilities compared to its interest-earning assets. A significant portion of the Company's deposits through its fintech partnerships reprice with changes in federal funds rates by contractual agreement. Therefore, an instantaneous change in this index rate results in a relative change in deposit costs for this portion of deposits. 
 55 

Stress testing the balance sheet and net interest income using instantaneous parallel rate shock movements in the yield curve is a regulatory and banking industry practice. However, these stress tests may not represent a realistic forecast of future interest rate movements in the yield curve. In addition, instantaneous parallel rate shock modeling is not a predictor of actual future performance of earnings. It is a financial metric used to manage interest rate risk and track the movement of the Company s interest rate risk position over a historical time frame for comparison purposes. 
 The asset and liability repricing characteristics of the Company s assets and liabilities will have a significant impact on its future interest rate risk profile.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In the ordinary course of operations, the Company is party to legal proceedings. Based upon information currently available, management believes that such legal proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 For information regarding legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, please see Note 13 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Except as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. Additional risks not presently known to the Company, or that are currently deem immaterial, may also adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations. See also Cautionary Note About Forward-Looking Statements, included in Part 1, Item 2, of this Form 10-Q. 
 Liquidity and Capital 
 
 Future issuances of the Company s common stock or other securities, including upon the exercise of warrants issued by the Company, could adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock and could be dilutive. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company completed the Private Placements pursuant to which it has issued approximately (i) 53.9 million shares of the Company s common stock, (ii) warrants to purchase 23.8 million shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 2.50 per share and 2.4 million shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 2.39 per share, (iii) 2,732 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, which are convertible or exchangeable into 10.9 million shares of the Company s common stock, and (iv) warrants to purchase 1,441 shares of Series C Preferred Stock at an exercise price of 10 thousand per share, which are convertible or exchangeable upon exercise into 5.7 million shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 2.50 per share. 
 The issuance of shares of common stock in the Private Placements has resulted, and upon the conversion or exchange of the Series C Preferred Stock and upon exercise of the warrants will result, in substantial dilution to the holders of common stock in place prior to the consummation of the Private Placements and a significant reduction in the percentage interests of such common shareholders in the voting power and in the future earnings per share of their common stock. Further, the exercise of such warrants at any time when the exercise price is less than the tangible book value of the shares of the Company s common stock received will be dilutive to the tangible book value of the then existing common shareholders. The resale of the additional shares of the Company s common stock could also cause the market price of the Company s common stock to decline. 
 In addition, the Company s board of directors, without the approval of shareholders, could from time to time decide to issue additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, which may adversely affect the market price of the shares of common stock and could be substantially dilutive to holders of the Company s common stock. Any sale of additional shares of the Company s common stock may be at prices lower than the current market value of the Company s common stock. In addition, new investors may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to, and that could adversely affect, the Company s existing shareholders. For example, preferred stock would be senior to common stock in right of dividends and as to distributions in liquidation. The Company s shareholders bear the risk of future securities offerings diluting their stock holdings, adversely affecting their rights as shareholders, and/or reducing the market price of the Company s common stock. 
 Sales of large amounts of the Company s common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, may depress the Company s stock price. 
 The market price of the Company s common stock could drop if existing shareholders decide to sell their shares, especially certain of the purchasers in the Private Placements. As of July 19, 2024, Kenneth L. Lehman owned approximately 20.0 million common shares, or about 27.2 of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, and Castle Creek Capital Partners VIII, LP Castle Creek owned 593,078 common shares and owned all 2,732 outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, which are convertible or exchangeable into approximately 10.9 million shares of the Company s common stock in certain circumstances, which, taken together, would constitute about 13.6 of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock (taking into account such additional shares of the 
 57 

Company s common stock upon conversion or exchange). The market price could drop significantly if one or more shareholders sold substantial amounts of the Company s common stock or other investors perceive sales to be imminent. The Company cannot foresee the impact of such potential sales on the market, but it is possible that if a significant percentage of shares were attempted to be sold within a short period of time, the market for the Company s shares would be adversely affected. Even if a substantial number of sales do not occur within a short period of time, the mere existence of this market overhang could have a negative impact on the market for the Company s common stock . 
 Kenneth L. Lehman and Castle Creek are substantial holders of the Company s securities. 
 Following the conversion or exchange of the Series C Preferred Stock, the Company expects that Mr. Lehman will own approximately 20.0 million common shares, or about 23.7 of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, and Castle Creek will own approximately 11.5 million common shares, or about 13.6 of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock (in each case, taking into account such additional shares of the Company s common stock upon conversion or exchange). Pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement with the purchasers in the Private Placements, Mr. Lehman has the right to appoint one representative on the Company s Board of Directors, and Castle Creek has the right to appoint two representatives on the Company s Board of Directors. Mr. Lehman and/or Castle Creek may have individual economic interests that are different from the other s interests and different from the interests of the Company s other shareholders. 
 The Company's Series C Preferred Stock has rights, preferences, and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights, preferences, and privileges of common stock, which could adversely affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition. 
 The Series C Preferred Stock has certain rights, preferences, and privileges compared to the rights, preferences, and privileges of common stock. For example, the Series C Preferred Stock is senior to the Company s common stock, such that in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company s affairs, each holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive for each share of Series C Preferred Stock, out of the assets of the Company or proceeds thereof available for distribution to shareholders of the Company, before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to the holders of shares of the Company s common stock, payment in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the liquidation amount (which is initially 10 thousand per share of Series C Preferred Stock) and (ii) any declared and unpaid dividends on such share of Series C Preferred Stock (collectively, the Liquidation Preference ). In the case of a merger, sale of substantially all of the Company s assets, or certain other reorganization events, each holder of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive for each share of Series C Preferred Stock, out of the assets of the Company or proceeds thereof (whether capital or surplus), legally available for distribution to the shareholders of the Company, a preference distribution equal to two times the amount of the Liquidation Preference. 
 The Company s obligations to the holders of Series C Preferred Stock could limit its ability to obtain additional financing, which could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. Additionally, the preferential rights of the Series C Preferred Stock could also result in divergent interests between the holders of the Company s common stock and the holders of Series C Preferred Stock.
