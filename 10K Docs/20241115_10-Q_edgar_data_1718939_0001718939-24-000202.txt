Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation On July 6, 2023, the Company received confirmation of the acceptance of its Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Third Restated Certificate") from the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Third Restated Certificate was approved by the Company s stockholders by written consent pursuant to a definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 13, 2023. Written consent from the majority of stockholders was received as of May 13, 2023.

 million, net operating cash outflows of million for the same period, working capital of negative million and an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months following the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued is dependent upon its ability to produce revenues and/or obtain financing sufficient to meet current and future obligations and deploy such to produce profitable operating results. Management has evaluated these conditions and plans to generate revenue and raise capital as needed to satisfy the Company s capital needs. While the negotiation of significant additional revenue is well advanced, it has not reached a stage that allows it to be factored into a going concern evaluation. In addition, although the Company has previously been successful in raising capital as needed and has already made plans to do so as well as restructuring expenses to meet the Company s cash needs, no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in its capital raising efforts.

 The Company considers this entity to be a variable interest entity VIE because it is thinly capitalized and holds no cash.

Further, management of the Company also acts as management of TSIH and is the decision-maker as management grants shares held by TSIH to employees of the Company. As this VIE's primary purpose is to hold shares in the Company from time to time and holds no other liabilities or assets, the Company is the primary beneficiary of TSIH and will consolidate the VIE.

 Key Business Measures 
 In addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key non-GAAP business measures to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 This discussion includes information about Adjusted EBITDA that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by U.S. GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure is included below. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents U.S. GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude (1) other expense, (2) other income, (3) gain on sale of mobile hardware, (4) interest expense, (5) interest income, (6) stock-based compensation, (7) change in fair value of warrant liabilities (8) impairment of assets, (9) non-cash expenses for in-kind services, (10) depreciation, and (11) certain other items management believes affect the comparability of operating results. 
 Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results under U.S. GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about our period-over-period results. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our Company and our management, and it will be a focus as we invest in and grow the business. 
 31 

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs. 
 Although Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of certain charges or gains resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. 
 Due to these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplement to our U.S. GAAP results. 
 Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA 
 For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss)

 (2,141,683) 315,811 (6,647,249) (4,046,918) 
 Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) (non-GAAP) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased to a 2.14 million loss from a 316 thousand gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company signed a license agreement with Boumarang valued at 5.00 million and accounted for under other income. This figure was deducted from the Net income to arrive at the Adjusted EBITDA loss (non-GAAP), which is the primary driver for the significant change in Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) (non-GAAP) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period. The 5.00 million was partially offset by other expense including a 1.17 million loss related to the difference in the cash paid for the warrants and the FMV of the warrants issued on September 3, 2024 and a loss of 360 thousand related to the difference in the cash paid for the warrants and the FMV of the warrants issued on September 10, 2024. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized non-refundable license revenue advances from Interactive Global Solutions IGS for the provision of software of 2.51 million. This was a one-time occurrence which significantly improved our net revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2023 - and because there was no similar transaction during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was a contributor to the significant change in Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) (non-GAAP) for the three months ended September 30, 2024. See Results of Operations below for further discussion on the drivers behind the increase in Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) (non-GAAP) during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) (non-GAAP) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 64.25 , to a 6.65 million loss from a 4.05 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase in Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) (non-GAAP) was driven primarily by the license agreement with Boumarang valued at 5.00 million and accounted for under other income. This figure got deducted from the Net loss before taxes to arrive at the adjusted EBITDA loss. The 5.00 million was partially offset by other expense including a 1.17 million loss related to the 
 32 

difference in the cash paid the warrants and the FMV of the warrants issued on September 3, 2024 and a loss of 360 thousand related to the difference in the cash paid for the warrants and the FMV of the warrants issued on September 10, 2024. Additionally, the decrease of 2.40 million or 60.22 in Net revenue as a result of recognizing the IGS non-refundable license revenue advances for the provision of software of 2.51 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also is a factor in increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period, as there was no similar one-time transaction that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that significantly increased net revenues. See Results of Operations below for further discussion on the drivers behind the increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss (non-GAAP) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net revenue 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Net revenue 511,081 3,065,804 (2,554,723) (83.33) 
 33 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Net revenue decreased to 511 thousand, or an 83.33 decrease from the Net revenue of 3.07 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the 511 thousand in Net revenue consisted of 339 thousand from an S P 500 bank, 90 thousand from Mastercard, and various other customers for the remaining 82 thousand. The majority of the decrease in net revenue compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 relates to the termination of the September 15, 2022 Master Services Agreement with IGS ("IGS Contract") which caused the Company to recognize non-refundable license revenue advances from IGS under the IGS Contract for the provision of software of 2.51 million. This was a one-time occurrence which significantly improved our net revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and therefore is the primary reason for the stark decrease in net revenues of the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated 314 thousand total revenue from customers using the Orchestration Layer. This includes implementing the Orchestration Layer platform for 6 new enterprise customers through FIS on the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform during the three months ended September 30, 2024. In comparison, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company generated 139 thousand total revenue from Orchestration Layer customers. Since its launch in the third quarter of 2022, there have been 73 enterprise customers on the Orchestration Layer platform, including 60 financial institutions, as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, revenue from the Orchestration Layer's flagship enterprise customer grew 0.51 between the comparative periods as a result of transitioning and launching the customer on the Orchestration Layer platform. Orchestration Layer's flagship enterprise customer is already in full production and generating monthly recurring revenue with gross margins in excess of 79.64 . Finally, the Company S P 500 bank customer completed its transition to an augmented version of the SaaS platform during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Orchestration Layer is designed to be a one-stop-shop for Trust Stamp services and provides for easy integration to our products; chargeable on a per-use basis and is accelerating the Company s evolution from being exclusively a custom solutions provider to also offering a modular and highly scalable SaaS model with low-code implementation. 
 Cost of services 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Cost of services 254,892 239,313 15,579 6.51 
 Cost of services COS increased by 16 thousand or 6.51 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase during this period was primarily driven by costs of 91 thousand for the expansion of our proof of identity solutions using a third-party as required for proof of identity contracts. The solution was not considered a cost of sale until the fourth quarter of 2023, thus, there were no expenses for this solution during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of 79 thousand in internal development cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Research and development 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Research and development 569,506 605,196 (35,690) (5.90) 
 Research and development R D expenses decreased by 36 thousand, or 5.90 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in R D expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the decrease in outsourced software development with 10Clouds as the Company continued to transition this work internally which results in cost savings as internal work is more cost effective. Comparatively, outsourced software development costs decreased by 99.21 when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023. In both periods, R D expenses mainly were related to R D payroll and other R D compensation expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Selling, general, and administrative 2,181,907 2,053,524 128,383 6.25 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense SG A increased by 128 thousand, or 6.25 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in SG A expense was driven by a 270 thousand increase in salaries, stock-based compensation, payroll costs, and sales commissions during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Included in the 270 thousand was an increase of 236 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the timing of stock-based compensation awards. In addition, the Company incurred a 145 thousand increase in IT services costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to an AWS billing for usage not applied to a contract or used by the R D team during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The increases in SG A were offset by net variance reductions in SG A for the three months ended September 30, 2024 including a total reduction of 305 thousand in professional fees, marketing, travel costs, dues and subscription, office rent, and taxes. 
 In both periods, SG A expenses were primarily comprised of payroll and other compensation expenses to our Company's workforce.

 35 

expense incurred with respect to interest due to two subordinated business loans and security agreements that the Company entered into during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company also recorded 8 thousand in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for interest accrued on Malta's tax obligations.

The majority of the decrease in net revenue 
 36

 Research and development R D expenses decreased by 226 thousand, or 12.47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in R D expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the decrease in outsourced software development as the Company continued to transition this work internally which results in cost savings as internal work is more cost effective. Comparatively, outsourced software development costs decreased by 83.99 when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Selling, general, and administrative 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Selling, general, and administrative 6,805,995 5,900,715 905,280 15.34 
 Selling, general, and administrative expense SG A increased by 905 thousand, or 15.34 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in SG A expense was driven by a 1.30 million increase in salaries, stock-based compensation, payroll costs, and sales commissions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Included in the 1.30 million increase in salaries, stock-based compensation, payroll costs, and sales commissions is an increase of 702 thousand in SG A during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the timing of stock-based compensation awards. 
 The Company also incurred a 141 thousand increase in IT services during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to an AWS billing for usage not applied to a contract or used by the R D team during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Furthermore, there was a 109 thousand increase in SG A when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulting from the reversal of out-of-period costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 associated with carrying mobile hardware assets, reversed due to the cancellation of the related mobile hardware subscription. In addition, the Company had an increase in dues and subscriptions, due to continued business development and growth, of 70 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other notable increases in SG A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a total increase of 93 thousand in travel costs and accounting and audit fees. 
 The increases in SG A were partially offset by notable reductions in SG A for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 including a total reduction of 810 thousand in professional fees, management consulting and training, and office rent as direct result of the Company's recent non-personnel cost cutting initiative. 
 In both periods, SG A expenses were primarily comprised of payroll and other compensation expenses to our Company's workforce.

 Depreciation and amortization D A decreased by 49 thousand, or 8.16 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver for the decrease in D A relates to the Company selling mobile hardware in April 2023. As a result of the sale, there is no expense for mobile hardware depreciation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 30 thousand of expense for mobile hardware depreciation during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, there was a decrease in D A during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to fully depreciating the Pixelpin (a company we acquired in March 2021) intangible asset during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was amortization expense of 17 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 2 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 The Company s Operating loss increased by 3.17 million or 63.56 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Operating loss was mostly related to the termination of the September 15, 2022 Master Services Agreement with IGS ("IGS Contract") which resulted in 2.51 
 38 

million decrease in Net revenue when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the release from future contractual obligations for maintenance and upgrades as a result of the termination of the IGS Contract. 
 The Company also noted an increase of 767 thousand or 8.56 rise in operating expenses as a result of bolstering our sales resources and bringing in-house technical positions which led to increases in our SG A expenses that outpaced Net revenue growth. 
 Interest expense, net 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Interest expense, net (149,644) (29,753) (119,891) 402.95 
 Interest expense, net increased by 120 thousand, or 402.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase of 88 thousand as a result of TSI entering into two subordinated business loans and security agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Furthermore, interest expense was also increased by a further 15 thousand as a result of the Malta loan interest rate increasing from 4.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company recorded 12 thousand in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for interest accrued on Malta's tax obligations.

 Other income increased by 4.97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the Company agreeing to grant a non-exclusive license to Boumarang to exploit certain of the Company s patents for the purpose of producing, selling, marketing, and distributing drones. As consideration for the grant of the non-exclusive license, Boumarang agreed to pay the Company a non-refundable license fee of 5.00 million in the form of a prepaid warrant issued by Boumarang to the Company for 5,000,000 shares of common stock of Boumarang at 1.00 per share. In addition, there was an increase of 187 thousand for the gain from a settlement of a mobile hardware bill that was outstanding as of September 30, 2023, which we negotiated for a lower payment, and paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

In addition, the Company recorded a 360 thousand inducement expense as a result of the Company entering into a securities purchase agreement on September 10, 2024 as an inducement to an a previously executed securities purchase agreement dated July 13, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 598 thousand cash in its banking accounts. The Company is generating revenues, but has not yet generated profits, with a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 4.59 million, Net operating cash outflows of 6.18 million for the same period, and an accumulated deficit of 55.45 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company is not currently generating sufficient amounts of cash to meet its requirements for the next 12 months. The Company anticipates that it will need to raise capital from equity and/or debt financings within the next six (6) months in order to fund its operations. 
 On November 13, 2024, the Company entered into a secured promissory note, which provides for a term loan to the Company with the principal amount of 3.00 million and interest rate of 14 per annum. Principal and any accrued but unpaid interest under this Note shall be due and payable upon demand of the Holder at any time after January 12, 2025. The note is secured by all of the Borrower s assets, including receivables. 
 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is a business that has not yet generated profits, with a Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 4.59 million, Net operating cash outflows of 6.18 million for the same period, and an Accumulated deficit of 55.45 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months, following the date the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued, is dependent upon its ability to produce revenues and/or obtain financing sufficient to meet current and future obligations and deploy such to produce profitable operating results. Management has evaluated these conditions and plans to generate revenue and raise capital as needed to satisfy its capital needs. While the negotiation of significant additional revenue is well advanced, it has not reached a stage that allows it to be factored into a going concern evaluation. In addition, although the Company has previously been successful in raising capital as needed and has already made plans to do so as well as restructuring expenses to meet the Company s cash needs, no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in its capital raising efforts. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.

 Those adjustments included the add back of 5.00 million related to non-cash investment gain, 360 thousand from loss on inducement agreements, 1.17 million due to the termination of a common stock warrant agreement, 957 thousand related to stock-based compensation mainly due to the timing of stock-based compensation awards.
