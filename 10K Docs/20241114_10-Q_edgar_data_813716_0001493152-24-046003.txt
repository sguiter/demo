and , respectively, related to the performance
obligations under product development service agreements with customers. These contracts are long term in nature and revenue is recognized
at certain milestone intervals upon our delivery and customer acceptance of work product related to those milestones: namely, product
design, packaging, branding display, and prototypes. There were no costs to obtain the contracts identified, and therefore, no asset
has been recorded for customer acquisition costs. We have not recognized impairment losses related to the receivables from these contracts
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Additionally,
we recognized revenues of and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to
the delivery of products to our customers. Each delivery is based on the unique contract with the customer, which is a stand-alone contract
that we retain the right to accept or reject. Upon acceptance, we oblige delivery of such product to the customer at an agreed-upon place,
time, and price. We recognize revenue under the unique contract upon fulfillment of our performance obligations therein, typically limited
to the delivery of product. 

The
Company also recognizes revenue from advanced royalty payments per the terms in its Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement with one
of its distributors. The royalty to be received is calculated based on of gross sales, with an annual minimum royalty paid upfront
per calendar year for the term of the contract. There is a non-refundable Minimum Royalty for FY 2023. The Company recognizes
the minimum royalty and corresponding expense at the time of receipt. 

at September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Because we owned less than of that company s stock as of each date, and no significant influence
or control exists, the investment is accounted for using the cost method. Pursuant to ASC 321, the Company also searched for observable
transactions in the investee s stock and found none. 

We
evaluated the investment for impairment and determined there was none during the periods presented.

and potentially issuable shares from the conversions of convertible debentures outstanding that were excluded
in dilutive outstanding shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to the anti-dilutive effect these
would have on net loss per share. We do not currently have adequate authorized but unissued shares to satisfy our obligations should
all instruments eligible to convert to common stock be exercised. We are not currently contemplating an increase in our authorized shares
but may do so in the future. 

as of September 30, 2024, and a net loss from continuing operations
of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of . These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish our business plan and eventually attain
profitable operations. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary
if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

In
the coming year, our foreseeable cash requirements will relate to development of business operations and associated expenses. We may
experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. 

Historically,
we have mainly relied upon shareholder loans and advances to finance operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital by
retaining net earnings, if any, or through future public or private offerings of our stock or loans from private investors, although
we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such financing. Our failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon our
shareholders and us.

collection efforts but has recovered no funds. In September 2018, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. The

required us to pay the IRS of cash deposits. The monthly payments were to continue until the account balances were paid in full or
until the collection statute of limitation expired on October 6, 2020. We are currently in communication with the IRS regarding the statute
of limitations on this settlement and appropriate next steps. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company wrote off 
as time barred debt. The amounts of and were due as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Employment
Agreements 

We
engage Iehab Hawatmeh, our president and chief executive officer, through an employment agreement entered in August 2009 and amended
in September 2017. In July 2017, Mr. Hawatmeh had resigned all positions with us to pursue other business activities, thereby effectively
terminating the agreement. However, the amendment to his employment agreement in September 2017 reinstated Mr. Hawatmeh to his previous
positions, with a salary in an amount to be determined. Among other things, the reinstated employment agreement: (a) grants options to
purchase a minimum of shares of our stock each year, with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock as of
the grant date, for the maximum term allowed under our stock option plan; (b) provides for health insurance coverage, cell phone, car
allowance, life insurance, and director and officer liability insurance, as well as any other bonus approved by our board; and (c) includes
additional incentive compensation as follows: (i) a quarterly bonus equal to of our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
and amortization for the applicable quarter; (ii) bonuses equal to of the net purchase price of any acquisitions we complete that
are directly generated and arranged by Mr. Hawatmeh; and (iii) an annual bonus (payable quarterly) equal to of our gross sales of
all products, net of returns and allowances. On January 1, 2020, we resumed accruing wages for our chief executive officer. A total of

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and notes to our unaudited
financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors discussed
elsewhere in this report. 

Overview 

Based
on our diversified expertise in manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and technology services in a wide variety of consumer products,
including tobacco products, medical devices, and beverages, around the world, we have an innovative and consumer-focused approach to
brand portfolio management, resting on a strong understanding of consumers domestically, and we have established a footprint in more
than 50 key, international markets. 

Since
2021, we continue under our 2019 five-year manufacturing and distribution agreement with an unrelated party to manufacture, distribute,
and sell condoms, electronic tobacco products, cigars, energy drinks, water beverages, and related merchandise, all using the HUSTLER 
brand name. 

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Sales
and Cost of Sales 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net sales of 256,070 and 766,512, respectively, a decrease of 510,422 or
66.6 . We had cost of sales of 130,072 and 112,094, respectively, and gross profit of 125,998 and 654,418, respectively. Revenues
are derived from the design, manufacture, and delivery of certain licensed products in accordance with our GloBrands-HUSTLER distribution
agreement. We had higher revenue in the prior period due to additional income from the licensing of novelties in an international territory. 

Operating
Expenses 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, employee costs were 129,743 and 149,100 respectively, a decrease of 19,357 or
13 . Employee costs decreased in the current period due to efficiencies based on the current business level. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, selling, general, and administrative expenses S,G A were 218,480
and 505,169, respectively, a decrease of 286,689 or 56.8 . The decrease in S,G A expenses period over period was the result of
a reduction in spending on marketing. 

Other
Expense 

Total
other expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 639,047 compared to 167,222 for the prior period. In the current
period we had 190,399 of interest expense and a loss of 448,898 on derivative valuation. We also had other income of 250. In the prior
period we had 192,487 of interest expense and a gain of 25,265 on derivative valuation. 

Net
Loss 

Our
net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 861,272 compared to 167,073 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, an increase to our net loss of 694,199. Our net loss increased in the current period due to the reasons discussed
above.

or 25.2 . We had cost of sales of 456,533 and 467,811, respectively, for gross profit of 619,419 and 970,621, respectively. Revenues
are derived from the design, manufacture, and delivery of certain licensed products in accordance with our GloBrands-HUSTLER distribution
agreement. We had higher revenue in the prior period due to additional income from the licensing of novelties in an international territory. 

Operating
Expenses 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, employee costs were 380,645 and 422,902 respectively, a decrease of 42,257 or 10 .
Employee costs decreased in the current period due to efficiencies based on the current business level. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, S,G A costs were 601,714 and 794,362, respectively, a decrease of 192,648 or
24.3 . The decrease in S,G A expenses period over period was the result of a reduction in spending on marketing. 

Other
Expense 

Total
other expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,336,006 compared to 567,660 for the prior period. In the current
period we had 561,099 of interest expense and a loss of 775,157 on derivative valuation. We also had other income of 250. In the prior
period we had 562,546 of interest expense, a loss of 19,238 on derivative valuation, a gain on forgiveness of debt of 13,000 and other
income of 1,124. 

Net
Loss 

Our
net loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,698,946 compared to 814,303 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, an increase to our net loss of 884,643 Our net loss increased in the current period due to the reasons discussed
above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
have had a history of losses from operations, as our expenses have been greater than our revenue. Our accumulated deficit was approximately
 60.8 million at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had current assets of 2 million and current liabilities of approximately
 23 million, resulting in a working capital deficit of approximately 21 million at September 30, 2024. 

Operating
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operations used 8,434 of net cash, comprised of a loss of 1,814,150, noncash items totaling
 967,890 consisting primarily of losses recognized from the changes in fair values of derivative liabilities and debt discount amortization,
and changes in working capital totaling 837,826. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operations provided 33,008 of net
cash, comprised of a loss of 929,087, noncash items totaling 195,833 consisting primarily of losses recognized from the changes in
fair values of derivative liabilities and debt discount amortization, and changes in working capital totaling 837,826. 

Investing
Activities 

There
were no investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used
 8,414 for investing activities for the purchase of equipment. 

17 

Financing
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities provided 8,434 of cash, compared to using 19,273 of cash during the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in financing consisted of repayments of loans. 

Our
Capital Resources and Anticipated Requirements 

Our
monthly operating costs are approximately 35,000 per month, excluding approximately 50,000 of accruing interest expense and capital
expenditures. We continue to focus on generating revenue and reducing our monthly business expenses through cost reductions and operational
streamlining. We have only recently begun to generate enough cash to sustain our day-to-day operations, and we expect to access external
capital resources in the future to fund any new projects we may undertake. We cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining such
capital. 

If
we seek infusions of capital from investors, it is unlikely that we will be able to obtain additional debt financing. If we did incur
additional debt, we would be required to devote additional cash flow to servicing the debt and securing the debt with assets. 

Our
issuance of additional shares for equity or for conversion of debt could dilute the value of our common stock and existing stockholders 
positions. 

Convertible
Debentures and Note Payable 

We
currently have an outstanding amended, restated, and consolidated secured convertible debenture with Tekfine, LLC, an unrelated entity,
with a maturity date of April 30, 2027, to the extent not previously converted. The amended debenture had a total outstanding principal
balance of 2.4 million, with accrued interest of 2 million as of September 30, 2024. We also have four additional convertible debentures
with Tekfine with maturity dates ranging from December 8, 2022, until December 30, 2022, totaling 275,000, unless earlier converted.
The convertible debentures and accrued interest are convertible into shares of our common stock at the lower of 100 or 0.10 (depending
on the instrument) or the lowest bid price for the 20 trading days prior to conversion. 

As
of September 30, 2024, there is 21,882 of short-term advances due to related parties. The advances are due on demand and included in
current liabilities. No demand for payment has been made. 

Going
Concern 

These
interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that adequate sources of financing
will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly,
the interim unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification
of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we not be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

We
have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations.
Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief
executive and financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon
that evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide
reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the periods prescribed by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive and financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls
is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
