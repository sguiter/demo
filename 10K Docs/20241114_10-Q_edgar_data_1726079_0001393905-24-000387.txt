 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with (i) our unaudited financial statement as of September 30, 2024, that appear elsewhere in this registration statement. This registration statement contains certain forward-looking statements and our future operating results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to announce publicly the results of any revisions of the forward -looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The future of our company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the sale of products and services through our websites. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its common stock, if necessary. 
 
 Plan of Operation 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 0 in total assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 55,238 in liabilities and an accumulated deficit of 141,253. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has 0 in total assets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has 33,065 in liabilities and an accumulated deficit of 119,080. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 16,368 and 7,150 respectively. Cash flows from financing activities for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 16,368 and 7,150 respectively. 
 
 We have no material commitments for the next twelve months. We will however require additional capital to meet our liquidity needs. Currently, the Company has determined that its anticipated monthly cash flow needs should not exceed of 6,000 per month for the remaining months of 2024. 
 
 It is anticipated that the app can be completed and operational in approximately 6 months and a full marketing campaign in place within 3 months after that. In the event that the full proceeds of the offering are not raised, the timing of the rollout will be slowed as discussed above in Business. 
 
 The Company s projected capital needs and its projected increase in expenses are based upon the Company s projected roll-out of generating sites over the coming twelve months, however, in the event that the full offering proceeds are not raised, the Company would roll-out new of generating sites at a slower pace and/or focus its energies on the refinement of existing sites to maximum their productivity. The Company s success does not depend on a scheduled roll-out and therefore it has flexibility to scale back its expenses to meet actual income. 
 
 It is anticipated that the Company will receive increasing revenues from operations in the coming year, however, since the Company has not earned any revenues to date, it is difficult to anticipate what those revenues might be, if any, and therefore, management has assumed for planning purposes only that it may need to sell common stock, take loans or advances from officers, directors or shareholders or enter into debt financing agreements in order to meet our cash needs over the coming twelve months. The Issuer has no agreements or understandings for any of the above-listed financing options. 
 
 The Company has no intention in investing in short-term or long-term discretionary financial programs of any kind.

Results of Operations 
 
 Lack of Revenues 
 
 We have limited operational history. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 we did not generate any revenues. We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate any revenues in the next 12 months continues to be uncertain. 
 
 Overview for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 The Company s operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 6,352 and 3,800 respectively. Operating expenses consisted of professional fees 4,300 and general and administrative expenses 2,052 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Operating expenses consisted of professional fees 1,800 and general and administrative expenses 2,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Overview for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 The Company s operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were 22,173 and 10,850 respectively. Operating expenses consisted of professional fees 15,080 and general and administrative expenses 7,093 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating expenses consisted of professional fees 4,850 and general and administrative expenses 6,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Loss 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company incurred a net loss of 22,173 and 10,850 respectively. 
 
 The Company recorded a cumulative net loss of 141,253 for the period from inception on December 5, 2017 to September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed a going concern opinion which raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern, due to the limited nature of the Company s operations to date, the Company does not believe that past performance is any indication of future performance. The impact on the Company s revenues of recognized trends and uncertainties in our market will not be recognized until such time as the Company has had sufficient operations to provide a baseline. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
 
 We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 
 10 
 
 Equipment, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements . Equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to seven years, or the life of the lease, as appropriate. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets . Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the discounted expected future net cash flows from the assets. 
 
 Revenue Recognition . The Company recognizes revenue when all four of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of the products and/or services has occurred; (iii) the fees earned can be readily determined; and (iv) collectability of the fees is reasonably assured. 
 
 Loss Per Common Share . Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, there were no share equivalents outstanding. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 
 Not Applicable to Smaller Reporting Companies. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15/15d-15 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Company s management, our President (Principal Executive Officer) and Treasurer (Principal Accounting Officer). Based upon the results of that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of a September 30, 2024, our Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective and do not provide reasonable assurance that material information related to our Company required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions on required disclosure. 
 
 MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 11 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in INTERNAL CONTROL -- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. 
 
 Our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria in INTERNAL CONTROL -- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK issued by the COSO. 
 
 This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 
 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
