The Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to any Private Placement Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to any Private Placement Shares held by them in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial Business Combination or certain amendments to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association prior thereto or to redeem 100 of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Private Placement Shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and (iv) vote any Private Placement Shares held by them in favor of our initial Business Combination.

 of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in Trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company only intends to complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, including the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Shares, will be held in a trust account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. The Company provides the holders (the Public Shareholders of the Company s Public Shares with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders are entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount held in the Trust Account, plus any investment income earned thereon (less taxes payable). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the Underwriter (as discussed in Note 6). These Public Shares are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. If the Company seeks shareholder approval, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem the Public Shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a public shareholder on the record date for the general meeting held to approve the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the Sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. On May 4, 2023, and in connection with the IPO, the Company adopted an Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. The Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), is restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.

There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or during any Extension Period. The Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares and Private Placement Shares if the Company fails to complete an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or during any Extension Period. However, the Sponsor is entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to its Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period or during any Extension Period. The Underwriter has agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period or during any Extension Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be less than . In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement (a Target ), or any claim by a taxing authority, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) per Public Share or (ii) the lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the Underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on October 27, 2021 formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not selected any business combination target.

 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 500,104, which was due to our net income of 4,183,639, offset by a gain on investments held in the Trust Account of 4,775,370 and changes in working capital of 91,627.

There were no cash flows from investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investment activities was 116,725,000, which was due to the investment of cash into the Trust Account. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 530,000, which was due to the proceeds from the promissory note, related party. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 117,897,925, which was due to proceeds from the sale of Private Placement Shares of 5,955,000, proceeds from sale of Placement Units, net of underwriting discount paid of 112,700,000, and proceeds from the promissory note, related party of 59,025 offset by the repayment of the promissory note, related party of 435,522 and the payment of offering costs of 380,578. On May 9, 2023, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units, (the Units and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units sold, the Public Shares ), including 1,500,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter s over-allotment option in full, generating gross proceeds of 115,000,000, which is discussed in Note 3. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of and issued 538,000 and 57,500 private placement shares to Alchemy DeepTech Capital LLC (the Sponsor and Cantor Fitzgerald Co. (the Underwriter ), respectively (together, the Private Placement Shares at a price of 10.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of 5,955,000. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on May 9, 2023, an amount of 116,725,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Shares was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 339,638 in cash and cash equivalents held outside of the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of 877,569. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of the Company s financing and acquisition plans. The Company anticipates that the cash held outside of the Trust Account as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to allow the Company to operate for at least one year from the date these unaudited condensed financial statements are issued, and therefore substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern exists. Management plans to address this uncertainty with the successful closing of a Business Combination. The Company has until November 9, 2024 to consummate a Business Combination. If a Business Combination is not consummated by November 9, 2024, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. The Company is in the process of identifying a potential company for an initial Business Combination but requires additional time. An Annual Meeting was held on October 31, 2024 and the shareholders of the Company approved amending the Company s Articles of Association as a special resolution, giving the Company the right to extend from November 9, 2024 (the Current Termination Date for an additional three months until February 9, 2025, and thereafter on a month-to-month basis, as determined by the Directors in their sole discretion, until September 9, 2025 (the Extended Date the date by which, if the Company has not consummated its initial Business Combination, the Company must liquidate and dissolve. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate any Business Combination by the Extended Date. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Contractual Obligations On September 30, 2024, we did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities.

 There are both 5,175,000 of deferred underwriting fees, as well as an aggregate of up to 530,000 in a promissory note due upon the completion of the Company s business combination. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified critical accounting estimates. Recent Accounting Standards In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. The amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which provides for additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax rate reconciliation using both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects, tax credits and nontaxable or nondeductible items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold and disaggregation by nature and jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as by individual jurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on disclosures in our Financial Statements. Our management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. JOBS Act The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, the unaudited condensed financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404,(ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement

 that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 pursuant to Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting This Report does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Except as set forth below, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Prospectus in connection with the Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC on May 5, 2023. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

 We depend on a variety of U.S. and multi-national financial institutions to provide us with banking services. The default or failure of one or more of the financial institutions that we rely on may adversely affect our business and financial condition. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at certain of these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of the failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our liquidity, business and financial condition. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities On December 6, 2021, the sponsor acquired 4,312,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of 50,000 (or approximately 0.01 per share) which was settled by paying for certain expenses on behalf of the Company. On October 26, 2022, 287,500 founder shares were surrendered by our sponsor for no consideration. These shares were then cancelled by the Company resulting in a decrease in the total number of founder shares outstanding from 4,312,500 shares to 4,025,000 shares. On February 7, 2023, 1,150,000 founder shares were surrendered and thereupon cancelled by the company resulting in a decrease in the total number of founder shares outstanding from 4,025,000 shares to 2,875,000 shares. Upon cancellation, 375,000 founder shares were subjected to forfeiture if the over-allotment option was not exercised in full or in part by our underwriter. All share amounts and related information have been retroactively restated to reflect the surrenders and cancellations. On May 5, 2023, the full over-allotment option was exercised, and therefore, the 375,000 founder shares were no longer subject to forfeiture. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, on May 9, 2023, we consummated the sale of and issued 538,000 and 57,500 placement shares to the sponsor and the representative, respectively, at a price of 10.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of 5,955,000. These issuances were made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales. On October 22, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,874,999 shares of its Class A ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share to Alchemy Deeptech Capital LLC, (the Sponsor ), and the holder of the Company s Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B Shares. The Class A Shares issued in connection with the Conversion are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B Shares before the Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination as described in the prospectus for our initial public offering. Following the Conversion, there are 14,970,499 Class A Shares and one Class B Share issued and outstanding. Use of Proceeds In connection with the initial public offering, we incurred offering costs of 9,088,588 (including deferred underwriting commissions of 5,175,000).
