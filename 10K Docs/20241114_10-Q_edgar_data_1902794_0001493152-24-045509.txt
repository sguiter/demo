NOTE
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Statements made in this report that are not statements of historical
fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. Investors
are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently
available to our management and involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our plans, strategies,
objectives, expectations and intentions, which are subject to change at any time at our discretion. Forward-looking statements include
information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan and strategies.
Forward-looking statements include our assessment, from time to time of our competitive position, the industry environment, potential
growth opportunities, the effects and events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars, epidemics or pandemics. Forward-looking
statements often include words such as anticipates, believes, could, forecast, 
 estimates, expects, suggest, hopes, intends, may, 
 might, plans, potential, predicts, targets, projects, 
 projections, should, could, will, would or the negative of these
terms or other similar expressions. 

Where
in any forward-looking statement we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based
on the current plans and expectations of our management, expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, there
can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or accomplished. The following include some, but not
all, of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated: 

current
 economic conditions, including consumer spending levels and the price elasticity of our products; 

the
 highly competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we compete; 

our
 ability to successfully manage social, political, economic, legal and other conditions affecting our operations and our supply chain
 sources, such as political instability and acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, disruption of markets, operational disruptions,
 changes in import or export laws, currency restrictions and currency exchange rate fluctuations; 

the
 impact of the loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials; 

our
 ability to manage our inventory effectively and reduce inventory reserves; 

our
 ability to optimize our global supply chain; 

our
 ability to distribute our products effectively through our ecommerce store and through our growing wholesale distribution channel; 

our
 ability to keep pace with changing consumer preferences; 

the
 impact of any inadequacy, interruption or failure with respect to our information technology or any data security breach; 

our
 ability to protect our reputation and the reputation and images of our licensed and any future proprietary brand(s); 

unanticipated
 changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or a change in our ability to realize deferred tax benefits; 

our
 ability to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations; 

changes
 in our relationship with our employees and costs and adverse publicity from violations of labor or environmental laws by us or our
 suppliers; 

our
 ability to attract and retain key personnel; and 

our
 ability to integrate and grow potential acquisitions successfully. 

The
reader should understand that the uncertainties and other factors listed above or identified elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in
our Annual Report are not a comprehensive list of all the uncertainties and other factors that may affect forward-looking statements.
Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict
all of them. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We do not undertake any obligation
to update or revise any forward-looking statements or the list of uncertainties and other factors that could affect those statements.
You should, however, consult further disclosures and risk factors we include in Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q and Current Reports filed on Form 8-K.

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K,
Form 10-K/A and Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024, June 3,
2024 and August 13, 2024, respectively. Interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. 

In
the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all of the adjustments
necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and
the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. Management acknowledges
its responsibility for the preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements which reflect all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary in its opinion for a fair statement of its consolidated financial position
and the consolidated results of its operations for the periods presented. 

MGOTeam1
was formed on October 11, 2018, and the Company entered into a Rollover Agreement by and among MGOTeam1 and members of MGOTeam1 on December
6, 2021. All of the members of MGOTeam1, except for one member who owns a membership interest in MGOTeam1, exchanged all of their
membership interests in MGOTeam1 for shares of the Company s common stock. A sole MGOTeam1 member did not rollover its
 membership interest in MGOTeam1 to the Company as of December 6, 2021, and remains a member in MGOTeam1. 

We
account for the minority interest in MGOTeam1 as non-controlling interest. Both the Company and MGOTeam1 were under common control,
the series of contractual arrangements between the Company and MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021 constituted a reorganization under common
control and are required to be retrospectively applied to the consolidated financial statements at their historical amounts. 

. Accordingly,
the financial statements presented in this Form 10-Q have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split historically. 

. MGO received full payment of the consideration on March 22, 2024.

Revenue
transactions associated with the sale of Stand Flagpoles products comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of
the sale of products to customers either through direct wholesale or online sales through our website www.standflagpoles.com .
We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of
sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of
the product. Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the
agreement with the customer. Control transfers to online customers at the time upon receipt of the goods. The transactions price is determined
based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms
for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 30 days
or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for direct wholesale and online transactions. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated revenues of and , and 
and , respectively, directly from consumers via our website. The Company does not have any major customers as revenue is primarily

Results
of Operations for Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same three months in 2023, revenues decreased 46.4 to 565,400 from 1,054,161.
The decrease over the prior year s comparable period is attributable to the fact that the Company reduced marketing expenses during
the third quarter of 2024 in an effort to increase profitability while consciously reducing marketing costs, which helped in successfully
increasing gross margin. Revenues reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2,661,253, representing an 5.7 decrease
over revenues of 2,823,601 posted for the comparable nine-month period in 2023. The modest decrease over the prior year s comparable
three and nine month periods is primarily attributable to the decrease in marketing spend in the third quarter of 2024, as noted above. 

Cost
of Sales and Gross Profit 

Cost
of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 decreased 69.2 to 72,414 from 235,003, respectively. This resulted
in a gross profit of 492,986 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which compared to 819,158 for the same three-month period
in 2023. Gross profit margin rose to 88.0 from 78.0 on a comparable three-month basis. 

Cost
of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 586,502, down 23.0 from 761,473 reported for the same nine-month period
in the prior year. This resulted in a 0.6 increase in gross profit of 2,074,751 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 2,062,128 for the nine-month ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit margin rose to 78.0 for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024 from 73.0 reported for the same nine-month period in the prior year. 

Operating
Expenses 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses decreased 35.1 to 1,850,717 as compared to total operating expenses
of 2,850,658 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to a 24.0 decline in selling, general and administrative
expenses, which decreased to 1,386,146 from 1,827,926, respectively, primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense
in the third quarter of 2024 versus the same period in 2023; and a 54.6 decrease in marketing and e-commerce expenses, which declined
to 464,571 from 1,022,732, respectively. The decrease in marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared
to the prior year s same three-month period is attributable to the fact that the Company made cognitive efforts to focus on a higher
return on marketing spend. In addition, warehouse and shipping costs decreased from the prior year due to one-time expenditures in 2023
of shipping the licensed goods to the Company s new third-party fulfillment center. 

Total
operating expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 7,738,241, representing a 36.0 increase compared to 5,688,343
in total operating expenses for the same nine months in 2023. The increase was largely attributable to a 71.8 increase in selling, general
and administrative expenses, which rose to 5,711,978 from 3,325,737, respectively; and a 14.2 decrease in marketing and e-commerce
expenses, which declined to 2,026,263 from 2,362,606, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related
to workforce expansion, stock-based compensation expenses which were not occurring in the prior six month period of 2023, and increased
costs of legal and accounting expenses pertaining to executing capital raises and advancing the business combination process with Heidmar
during the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in marketing and e-commerce expenses is due to the Company making a cognitive effort
to focus on higher returns on marketing spend during 2024. 

Other
(Income) Expenses 

Total
other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10,927 and 10,463, respectively, compared to total other interest
income of 0 and 29,876 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

23 

Net
Loss 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations was 1,346,804, a 33.7 decrease from a net loss of 2,031,500
reported for the same three-month period in 2023. Net income from discontinued operations increased to 44,237 from a net loss of 520,613
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Overall, net loss totaled 1,302,567 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 2,552,113 for the same three-month period ended September 30, 2023. After factoring net
income of 5,229 and a net loss of 62,800 for non-controlling interest for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was 1,307,796, or 0.52 loss per share, and 2,489,313, or 1.79 loss per share, respectively. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations was 5,653,027, a 57.2 increase from a net loss of 3,596,339
reported for the same nine-month period in 2023. Net income from discontinued operations rose to 1,938,008 from a net loss of 1,574,104
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of the assignment of the Messi License to Centric. Overall,
net loss totaled 3,715,019 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 5,170,443 posted for the same nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023. After factoring net income of 229,073 and a net loss of 185,556 for non-controlling interest for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was 3,944,092, or 1.90 loss
per share, and 4,984,887, or 3.67 loss per share, respectively. 

Cash
Flows 

As
of September 30, 2024, cash on hand from continuing operations was 1,435,288, as compared to 836,446 as of December 31, 2023, an increase
of 72 . The increase was primarily attributable to the assignment of the Messi Brand to Centric in exchange for 2,000,000 in
cash and their assumption of our obligation to pay 1.5 million in royalty payments to LMM in 2024, as well as net proceeds aggregating
 3,215,752 received from the sale of our common stock pursuant to our At-The-Market Offering ATM ). Until such time that
the Company fully implements its growth strategy or completes its business combination with Heidmar, it expects to continue generating
operating losses in the foreseeable future, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, higher marketing and inventory expenses and costs
associated with being a public company. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operations was 4,715,475, a decrease of 26 as compared to cash used in operations
of 6,396,563 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the assignment of the Messi
Brand to Centric in exchange for 2,000,000 in cash and their assumption of our obligation to pay 1.5 million in royalty payments
to Leo Messi Management in 2024. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was 1,999,488, compared to
cash used in investing activities of 179,853 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 1212 increase was due to no significant
purchases of property and equipment occurring during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset by the 2,000,000 in proceeds received
from the assignment of the Messi Brand to Centric. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 3,218,540, a decrease of 61 as compared to cash
provided by financing activities of 8,183,514 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was directly related to the
completion of the Company s initial public offering in January 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 2,393,015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss from continuing
operations of 5,653,027, inclusive of 5,711,978 for general and administrative expenses, including higher workforce expenses, stock-based
compensation expense, third-party logistics services, professional fees and rent expense for office space, as well as 2,026,263 for
marketing and ecommerce expenses. 

On
March 21, 2024, MGO assigned the Messi License to Centric, which paid the Company 2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay
the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024. Effective as of that date, the Company discontinued operations on The Messi Store . 

On
February 12, 2024, the SEC deemed the Company s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 effective. This registration statement
contained two prospectuses: 1) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance, and sale from time to time of our common
stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to 100,000,000; and 2)
a sales agreement prospectus ATM covering the potential offering, issuance, and sale from time to time of shares of our
common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement with Maxim Group
LLC. On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 Amendment to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM
whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from 1,650,000 to 3,389,384. As of
the date of this report, the Company had received net proceeds of 3,215,752 from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to the
ATM and has exhausted the ATM.

If
the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company
could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if
no other means of financing operations are available. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership
held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially
increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification
of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As such,
the aforementioned factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for
a reasonable period. 

Critical
Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments, and Use of Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US
GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our most critical estimates include those related
to revenue recognition, inventories and reserves for excess and obsolescence, accounting for stock-based awards, and income taxes. On
an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our existing critical accounting policies which
are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Form 10-K/A and Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024, June 3, 2024 and August 13, 2024, respectively. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements,
including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 

Inflation 

Over
the past 18 months, inflation has adversely affected our business, financial condition, and results of operations by increasing our overall
cost structure, and such affects will be further exacerbated if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices, we charge
our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital
costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates, and other similar effects. As a result of
inflation, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, cost increases. In addition, poor economic and market conditions, including
a potential recession, may negatively impact market sentiment, decreasing the demand for sportswear and outerwear, which would adversely
affect our operating income and results of operations. If we are unable to take effective measures in a timely manner to mitigate the
impact of inflation, as well as a potential recession, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected. 

Climate
Change 

Our
opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any
material effect on our operations. 

25 

New
Accounting Pronouncements 

There
were certain updates recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ), most of which represented technical
corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

may be outstanding, together with interest on the unpaid outstanding principal balance of each advance, calculated as described in the
 INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD paragraph using an interest rate of 8.150 per annum based on a year of 360 days. Interest
shall be calculated from the date of each advance until repayment of each advance. The interest rate may change under the terms and conditions
of the INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT section. 

PAYMENT.

payment of all outstanding principal plus all accrued unpaid interest on August 7, 2026. In addition, Borrower will pay regular monthly
payments of all accrued unpaid interest due as of each payment date, beginning September 7, 2024, with all subsequent interest payments

CALCULATION METHOD. Interest on this Note is computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a

not used or filed a financing statement under any other name for at least the last five (5) years.

Hazardous
Substances. Except as disclosed to and acknowledged by Lender in writing, Borrower represents and warrants that: (1) During the period
of Borrower s ownership of the Collateral, there has been no use, generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, disposal, release
or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance by any person on, under, about or from any of the Collateral. (2) Borrower has no knowledge
of, or reason to believe that there has been (a) any breach or violation of any Environmental Laws; (b) any use, generation, manufacture,
storage, treatment, disposal, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance on, under, about or from the Collateral by any
prior owners or occupants of any of the Collateral; or (c) any actual or threatened litigation or claims of any kind by any person relating
to such matters. (3) Neither Borrower nor any tenant, contractor, agent or other authorized user of any of the Collateral shall use,
generate, manufacture, store, treat, dispose of or release any Hazardous Substance on, under, about or from any of the Collateral; and
any such activity shall be conducted in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances, including
without limitation all Environmental Laws. Borrower authorizes Lender and its agents to enter upon the Collateral to make such inspections
and tests as Lender may deem appropriate to determine compliance of the Collateral with this section of the Agreement. Any inspections
or tests made by Lender shall be at Borrower s expense and for Lender s purposes only and shall not be construed to create
any responsibility or liability on the part of Lender to Borrower or to any other person. The representations and warranties contained
herein are based on Borrower s due diligence in investigating the Collateral for hazardous waste and Hazardous Substances. Borrower
hereby (1) releases and waives any future claims against Lender for indemnity or contribution in the event Borrower becomes liable for
cleanup or other costs under any such laws, and (2) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Lender against any and all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, penalties, and expenses, including attorneys fees, consultants fees, and costs which Lender
may directly or indirectly sustain or suffer resulting from a breach of this section of the Agreement or as a consequence of any use,
generation, manufacture, storage, disposal, release or threatened release of a hazardous waste or substance on the Collateral. The provisions
of this section of the Agreement, including the obligation to indemnify and defend, shall survive the payment of the Indebtedness and
the termination, expiration or satisfaction of this Agreement and shall not be affected by Lender s acquisition of any interest
in any of the Collateral, whether by foreclosure or otherwise. 

Litigation
and Claims. No litigation, claim, investigation, administrative proceeding or similar action (including those for unpaid taxes) against
Borrower is pending or threatened, and no other event has occurred which may materially adversely affect Borrower s financial condition
or properties, other than litigation, claims, or other events, if any, that have been disclosed to and acknowledged by Lender in writing. 

Taxes.
 To the best of Borrower s knowledge, all of Borrower s tax returns and reports that are or were required to be filed,
have been filed, and all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges have been paid in full, except those presently being or to
be contested by Borrower in good faith in the ordinary course of business and for which adequate reserves have been provided. 

Lien
Priority. Unless otherwise previously disclosed to Lender in writing, Borrower has not entered into or granted any Security Agreements,
or permitted the filing or attachment of any Security Interests on or affecting any of the Collateral directly or indirectly securing
repayment of Borrower s Loan and Note, that would be prior or that may in any way be superior to Lender s Security Interests
and rights in and to such Collateral. 

Binding
Effect. This Agreement, the Note, all Security Agreements (if any), and all Related Documents are binding upon the signers thereof,
as well as upon their successors, representatives and assigns, and are legally enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. 

AFFIRMATIVE

including stipulations that coverages will not be cancelled or diminished without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lender.
Each insurance policy also shall include an endorsement providing that coverage in favor of Lender will not be impaired in any way by
any act, omission or default of Borrower or any other person. In connection with all policies covering assets in which Lender holds or

or replacement cost of any Collateral. The cost of such appraisal shall be paid by Borrower.

properties, income, or profits. Provided however, Borrower will not be required to pay and discharge any such assessment, tax, charge,
levy, lien or claim so long as (1) the legality of the same shall be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and (2) Borrower
shall have established on Borrower s books adequate reserves with respect to such contested assessment, tax, charge, levy, lien,

any property or any facility owned, leased or used by Borrower.

with Governmental Requirements. Comply with all laws, ordinances, and regulations, now or hereafter in effect, of all governmental
authorities applicable to the conduct of Borrower s properties, businesses and operations, and to the use or occupancy of the Collateral,
including without limitation, the Americans With Disabilities Act. Borrower may contest in good faith any such law, ordinance, or regulation
and withhold compliance during any proceeding, including appropriate appeals, so long as Borrower has notified Lender in writing prior
to doing so and so long as, in Lender s sole opinion, Lender s interests in the Collateral are not jeopardized. Lender may
require Borrower to post adequate security or a surety bond, reasonably satisfactory to Lender, to protect Lender s interest. 

Beneficial
Ownership Information. Comply with all beneficial ownership information reporting requirements of the Corporate Transparency Act
and its implementing regulations (collectively the CTA), if applicable to that Borrower. Any Borrower that is or becomes a reporting

other properties and to examine or audit Borrower s books, accounts, and records and to make copies and memoranda of Borrower s
books, accounts, and records. If Borrower now or at any time hereafter maintains any records (including without limitation computer generated
records and computer software programs for the generation of such records) in the possession of a third party, Borrower, upon request
of Lender, shall notify such party to permit Lender free access to such records at all reasonable times and to provide Lender with copies
of any records it may request, all at Borrower s expense. 

Environmental
Compliance and Reports. Borrower shall comply in all respects with any and all Environmental Laws; not cause or permit to exist,
as a result of an intentional or unintentional action or omission on Borrower s part or on the part of any third party, on property
owned and/or occupied by Borrower, any environmental activity where damage may result to the environment, unless such environmental activity
is pursuant to and in compliance with the conditions of a permit issued by the appropriate federal, state or local governmental authorities;
shall furnish to Lender promptly and in any event within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof a copy of any notice, summons, lien,
citation, directive, letter or other communication from any governmental agency or instrumentality concerning any intentional or unintentional
action or omission on Borrower s part in connection with any environmental activity whether or not there is damage to the environment
and/or other natural resources. 

Additional
Assurances. Make, execute and deliver to Lender such promissory notes, mortgages, deeds of trust, security agreements, assignments,
financing statements, instruments, documents and other agreements as Lender or its attorneys may reasonably request to evidence and secure
the Loans and to perfect all Security Interests. 

Covenant
Default Fee. Borrower shall pay to Lender a Covenant Default Fee of 500.00 in the event that Borrower fails to meet the requirements
contained in the Financial Covenants and Ratios section above (if any). The Covenant Default Fee is in addition to and not a replacement
for any other rights or remedies of Lender. 

LENDER S
EXPENDITURES. If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender s interest in the Collateral or
if Borrower fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Borrower s
failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Borrower is required to discharge or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents,
Lender on Borrower s behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not
limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on
any Collateral and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving any Collateral. All such expenditures incurred or paid by
Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date
of repayment by Borrower. All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender s option, will (A) be payable
on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due
during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Note; or (C) be treated as a balloon
payment which will be due and payable at the Note s maturity. 

NEGATIVE
COVENANTS. Borrower covenants and agrees with Lender that while this Agreement is in effect, Borrower shall not, without the prior
written consent of Lender: 

Indebtedness
and Liens. (1) Except for trade debt incurred in the normal course of business and indebtedness to Lender contemplated by this Agreement,
create, incur or assume indebtedness for borrowed money, including finance leases, (2) sell, transfer, mortgage, assign, pledge, lease,
grant a security interest in, or encumber any of Borrower s assets (except as allowed as Permitted Liens), or (3) sell with recourse
any of Borrower s accounts receivable, except to Lender. 

Continuity
of Operations. (1) Engage in any business activities substantially different than those in which Borrower is presently engaged,
(2) cease operations, liquidate, merge or restructure as a legal entity (whether by division or otherwise), consolidate with or
acquire any other entity, change its name, convert to another type of entity or redomesticate, dissolve or transfer or sell
Collateral out of the ordinary course of business, or (3) make any distribution with respect to any capital account, whether by
reduction of capital or otherwise. 

Loans,
Acquisitions and Guaranties. (1) Loan, invest in or advance money or assets to any other person, enterprise or entity, (2) purchase,
create or acquire any interest in any other enterprise or entity, or (3) incur any obligation as surety or guarantor other than in the
ordinary course of business. 

Agreements.
 Enter into any agreement containing any provisions which would be violated or breached by the performance of Borrower s obligations
under this Agreement or in connection herewith. 

Loan No: 5037422 BUSINESS LOAN AGREEMENT (Continued) Page 4 

CESSATION
OF ADVANCES. If Lender has made any commitment to make any Loan to Borrower, whether under this Agreement or under any other agreement,
Lender shall have no obligation to make Loan Advances or to disburse Loan proceeds if: (A) Borrower or any Guarantor is in default under
the terms of this Agreement or any of the Related Documents or any other agreement that Borrower or any Guarantor has with Lender; (B)
Borrower or any Guarantor dies, becomes incompetent or becomes insolvent, files a petition in bankruptcy or similar proceedings, or is
adjudged a bankrupt; (C) there occurs a material adverse change in Borrower s financial condition, in the financial condition of
any Guarantor, or in the value of any Collateral securing any Loan; or (D) any Guarantor seeks, claims or otherwise attempts to limit,
modify or revoke such Guarantor s guaranty of the Loan or any other loan with Lender. 

RIGHT
OF SETOFF. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a right of setoff in all Borrower s accounts with Lender
(whether checking, savings, or some other account). This includes all accounts Borrower holds jointly with someone else and all accounts
Borrower may open in the future. However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts for which setoff would
be prohibited by law. Borrower authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or setoff all sums owing on the
Indebtedness against any and all such accounts, and, at Lender s option, to administratively freeze all such accounts to allow
Lender to protect Lender s charge and setoff rights provided in this paragraph. 

DEFAULT.
 Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: 

Payment
Default. Borrower fails to make any payment when due under the Loan. 

Other
Defaults. Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement
or in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other
agreement between Lender and Borrower. 

Default
in Favor of Third Parties. Borrower or any Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or
sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Borrower s
or any Grantor s property or Borrower s or any Grantor s ability to repay the Loans or perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement or any of the Related Documents. 

False
Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or on Borrower s behalf under
this Agreement or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or
becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter. 

Death
or Insolvency. The dissolution of Borrower (regardless of whether election to continue is made), any member withdraws from Borrower,
or any other termination of Borrower s existence as a going business or the death of any member, the insolvency of Borrower, the
appointment of a receiver for any part of Borrower s property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor
workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Borrower. 

Defective
Collateralization. This Agreement or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any
collateral document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason. 

Creditor
or Forfeiture Proceedings. Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession
or any other method, by any creditor of Borrower or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the Loan. This includes
a garnishment of any of Borrower s accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not
apply if there is a good faith dispute by Borrower as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor
or forfeiture proceeding and if Borrower gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender
monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being
an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute. 

Events
Affecting Guarantor. Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any Guarantor of any of the Indebtedness or any Guarantor
dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness. 

Adverse
Change. A material adverse change occurs in Borrower s financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance
of the Loan is impaired. 

Right
to Cure. If any default, other than a default on Indebtedness, is curable and if Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, has not
been given a notice of a similar default within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Borrower or Grantor, as the case
may be, after Lender sends written notice to Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, demanding cure of such default: (1) cure the default
within ten (10) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than ten (10) days, immediately initiate steps which Lender deems in Lender s
sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continue and complete all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient
to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical. 

EFFECT
OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. If any Event of Default shall occur, except where otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Related Documents,
all commitments and obligations of Lender under this Agreement or the Related Documents or any other agreement immediately will terminate
(including any obligation to make further Loan Advances or disbursements), and, at Lender s option, all Indebtedness immediately
will become due and payable, all without notice of any kind to Borrower, except that in the case of an Event of Default of the type described
in the Insolvency subsection above, such acceleration shall be automatic and not optional. In addition, Lender shall have
all the rights and remedies provided in the Related Documents or available at law, in equity, or otherwise. Except as may be prohibited
by applicable law, all of Lender s rights and remedies shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election
by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action
to perform an obligation of Borrower or of any Grantor shall not affect Lender s right to declare a default and to exercise its
rights and remedies. 

MISCELLANEOUS
PROVISIONS. The following miscellaneous provisions are a part of this Agreement: 

Amendments.
 This Agreement, together with any Related Documents, constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties as to the
matters set forth in this Agreement. No alteration of or amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless given in writing and signed
by the party or parties sought to be charged or bound by the alteration or amendment. 

Attorneys 
Fees; Expenses. Borrower agrees to pay upon demand all of Lender s costs and expenses, including Lender s reasonable
attorneys fees and Lender s legal expenses, incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement. Lender may hire
or pay someone else to help enforce this Agreement, and Borrower shall pay the costs and expenses of such enforcement. Costs and expenses
include Lender s reasonable attorneys fees and legal expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including reasonable attorneys 
fees and legal expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals,
and any anticipated post-judgment collection services. Borrower also shall pay all court costs and such additional fees as may be directed
by the court.

Caption
Headings. Caption headings in this Agreement are for convenience purposes only and are not to be used to interpret or define the
provisions of this Agreement. 

Consent
to Loan Participation. Borrower agrees and consents to Lender s sale or transfer, whether now or later, of one or more participation
interests in the Loan to one or more purchasers, whether related or unrelated to Lender. Lender may provide, without any limitation whatsoever,
to any one or more purchasers, or potential purchasers, any information or knowledge Lender may have about Borrower or about any other
matter relating to the Loan, and Borrower hereby waives any rights to privacy Borrower may have with respect to such matters. Borrower
additionally waives any and all notices of sale of participation interests, as well as all notices of any repurchase of such participation
interests. Borrower also agrees that the purchasers of any such participation interests will be considered as the absolute owners of
such interests in the Loan and will have all the rights granted under the participation agreement or agreements governing the sale of
such participation interests. Borrower further waives all rights of offset or counterclaim that it may have now or later against Lender
or against any purchaser of such a participation interest and unconditionally agrees that either Lender or such purchaser may enforce
Borrower s obligation under the Loan irrespective of the failure or insolvency of any holder of any interest in the Loan. Borrower
further agrees that the purchaser of any such participation interests may enforce its interests irrespective of any personal claims or
defenses that Borrower may have against Lender. 

Governing
Law. This Agreement will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of
the State of Minnesota without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. This Agreement has been accepted by Lender in the State of
Minnesota. 

No
Waiver by Lender. Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Agreement unless such waiver is given in writing
and signed by Lender. No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any
other right. A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Agreement shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender s right otherwise
to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course of
dealing between Lender and Borrower, or between Lender and any Grantor, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender s rights or
of any of Borrower s or any Grantor s obligations as to any future transactions. Whenever the consent of Lender is required
under this Agreement, the granting of such consent by Lender in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances
where such consent is required and in all cases such consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Lender. 

Notices.
 Any notice required to be given under this Agreement shall be given in writing, and shall be effective when actually delivered, when
actually received by telefacsimile (unless otherwise required by law), when deposited with a nationally recognized overnight courier,
or, if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, as first class, certified or registered mail postage prepaid, directed to the
addresses shown near the beginning of this Agreement. Any party may change its address for notices under this Agreement by giving formal
written notice to the other parties, specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party s address. For notice purposes,
Borrower agrees to keep Lender informed at all times of Borrower s current address. Unless otherwise provided or required by law,
if there is more than one Borrower, any notice given by Lender to any Borrower is deemed to be notice given to all Borrowers. 

Severability.
 If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any circumstance,
that finding shall not make the offending provision illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any other circumstance. If feasible, the
offending provision shall be considered modified so that it becomes legal, valid and enforceable. If the offending provision cannot be
so modified, it shall be considered deleted from this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by law, the illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability
of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. 

Subsidiaries
and Affiliates of Borrower. To the extent the context of any provisions of this Agreement makes it appropriate, including without
limitation any representation, warranty or covenant, the word Borrower as used in this Agreement shall include all of Borrower s
subsidiaries and affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing however, under no circumstances shall this Agreement be construed to require
Lender to make any Loan or other financial accommodation to any of Borrower s subsidiaries or affiliates. 

Successors
and Assigns. All covenants and agreements by or on behalf of Borrower contained in this Agreement or any Related Documents shall
bind Borrower s successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns. Borrower shall
not, however, have the right to assign Borrower s rights under this Agreement or any interest therein, without the prior written
consent of Lender. 

Survival
of Representations and Warranties. Borrower understands and agrees that in extending Loan Advances, Lender is relying on all representations,
warranties, and covenants made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument delivered by Borrower to Lender
under this Agreement or the Related Documents. Borrower further agrees that regardless of any investigation made by Lender, all such
representations, warranties and covenants will survive the extension of Loan Advances and delivery to Lender of the Related Documents,
shall be continuing in nature, shall be deemed made and redated by Borrower at the time each Loan Advance is made, and shall remain in
full force and effect until such time as Borrower s Indebtedness shall be paid in full, or until this Agreement shall be terminated
in the manner provided above, whichever is the last to occur. 

Time
is of the Essence. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement. 

Waive
Jury. All parties to this Agreement hereby waive the right to any jury trial in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by any
party against any other party. 

Errors
and Omissions. Upon the request of Lender, Borrower agrees to fully cooperate to correct any clerical errors and/or omissions in
loan documents, including but not limited to the Note, guaranties, collateral, and any other Related Documents. This includes the execution

CONTINUING
GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE. For good and valuable consideration, Guarantor absolutely and unconditionally guarantees full
and punctual payment and satisfaction of the Indebtedness of Borrower to Lender, and the performance and discharge of all Borrower s
obligations under the Note and the Related Documents. This is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection, so Lender
can enforce this Guaranty against Guarantor even when Lender has not exhausted Lender s remedies against anyone else obligated
to pay the Indebtedness or against any collateral securing the Indebtedness, this Guaranty or any other guaranty of the Indebtedness.
Guarantor will make any payments to Lender or its order, on demand, in legal tender of the United States of America, in same-day funds,
without set-off or deduction or counterclaim, and will otherwise perform Borrower s obligations under the Note and Related Documents.
Under this Guaranty, Guarantor s liability is unlimited and Guarantor s obligations are continuing. 

INDEBTEDNESS.
 The word Indebtedness as used in this Guaranty means all of the principal amount outstanding from time to time and
at any one or more times, accrued unpaid interest thereon and all collection costs and legal expenses related thereto permitted by law,
reasonable attorneys fees, arising from any and all debts, liabilities and obligations of every nature or form, now existing or
hereafter arising or acquired, that Borrower individually or collectively or interchangeably with others, owes or will owe Lender. Indebtedness 
includes, without limitation, loans, advances, debts, overdraft indebtedness, credit card indebtedness, lease obligations, liabilities
and obligations under any interest rate protection agreements or foreign currency exchange agreements or commodity price protection agreements,
other obligations, and liabilities of Borrower, and any present or future judgments against Borrower, future advances, loans or transactions
that renew, extend, modify, refinance, consolidate or substitute these debts, liabilities and obligations whether: voluntarily or involuntarily
incurred; due or to become due by their terms or acceleration; absolute or contingent; liquidated or unliquidated; determined or undetermined;
direct or indirect; primary or secondary in nature or arising from a guaranty or surety; secured or unsecured; joint or several or joint
and several; evidenced by a negotiable or non-negotiable instrument or writing; originated by Lender or another or others; barred or
unenforceable against Borrower for any reason whatsoever; for any transactions that may be voidable for any reason (such as infancy,
insanity, ultra vires or otherwise); and originated then reduced or extinguished and then afterwards increased or reinstated. 

If
Lender presently holds one or more guaranties, or hereafter receives additional guaranties from Guarantor, Lender s rights under
all guaranties shall be cumulative. This Guaranty shall not (unless specifically provided below to the contrary) affect or invalidate
any such other guaranties. Guarantor s liability will be Guarantor s aggregate liability under the terms of this Guaranty
and any such other unterminated guaranties. 

CONTINUING
GUARANTY. THIS IS A CONTINUING GUARANTY UNDER WHICH GUARANTOR AGREES TO GUARANTEE THE FULL AND PUNCTUAL PAYMENT, PERFORMANCE
AND SATISFACTION OF THE INDEBTEDNESS OF BORROWER TO LENDER, NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING OR ACQUIRED, ON AN OPEN AND CONTINUING
BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY PAYMENTS MADE ON THE INDEBTEDNESS WILL NOT DISCHARGE OR DIMINISH GUARANTOR S OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITY
UNDER THIS GUARANTY FOR ANY REMAINING AND SUCCEEDING INDEBTEDNESS EVEN WHEN ALL OR PART OF THE OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS MAY BE A ZERO
BALANCE FROM TIME TO TIME. 

DURATION
OF GUARANTY. This Guaranty will take effect when received by Lender without the necessity of any acceptance by Lender, or any notice
to Guarantor or to Borrower, and will continue in full force until all the Indebtedness incurred or contracted before receipt by Lender
of any notice of revocation shall have been fully and finally paid and satisfied and all of Guarantor s other obligations under
this Guaranty shall have been performed in full. If Guarantor elects to revoke this Guaranty, Guarantor may only do so in writing. Guarantor s
written notice of revocation must be mailed to Lender, by certified mail, at Lender s address listed above or such other place
as Lender may designate in writing. Written revocation of this Guaranty will apply only to new Indebtedness created after actual receipt
by Lender of Guarantor s written revocation. For this purpose and without limitation, the term new Indebtedness does
not include the Indebtedness which at the time of notice of revocation is contingent, unliquidated, undetermined or not due and which
later becomes absolute, liquidated, determined or due. For this purpose and without limitation, new Indebtedness does not
include all or part of the Indebtedness that is: incurred by Borrower prior to revocation; incurred under a commitment that became binding
before revocation; any renewals, extensions, substitutions, and modifications of the Indebtedness. This Guaranty shall bind Guarantor s
estate as to the Indebtedness created both before and after Guarantor s death or incapacity, regardless of Lender s actual
notice of Guarantor s death. Subject to the foregoing, Guarantor s executor or administrator or other legal representative
may terminate this Guaranty in the same manner in which Guarantor might have terminated it and with the same effect. Release of any other
guarantor or termination of any other guaranty of the Indebtedness shall not affect the liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty. A
revocation Lender receives from any one or more Guarantors shall not affect the liability of any remaining Guarantors under this Guaranty.
 It is anticipated that fluctuations may occur in the aggregate amount of the Indebtedness covered by this Guaranty, and Guarantor
specifically acknowledges and agrees that reductions in the amount of the Indebtedness, even to zero dollars 0.00), shall not constitute
a termination of this Guaranty. This Guaranty is binding upon Guarantor and Guarantor s heirs, successors and assigns so long as
any of the Indebtedness remains unpaid and even though the Indebtedness may from time to time be zero dollars 0.00). 

GUARANTOR S
AUTHORIZATION TO LENDER. Guarantor authorizes Lender, either before or after any revocation hereof, without notice or demand and
without lessening Guarantor s liability under this Guaranty, from time to time: (A) prior to revocation as set forth above,
to make one or more additional secured or unsecured loans to Borrower, to lease equipment or other goods to Borrower, or otherwise to
extend additional credit to Borrower; (B) to alter, compromise, renew, extend, accelerate, or otherwise change one or more times the
time for payment or other terms of the Indebtedness or any part of the Indebtedness, including increases and decreases of the rate of
interest on the Indebtedness; extensions may be repeated and may be for longer than the original loan term; (C) to take and hold security
for the payment of this Guaranty or the Indebtedness, and exchange, enforce, waive, subordinate, fail or decide not to perfect, and release
any such security, with or without the substitution of new collateral; (D) to release, substitute, agree not to sue, or deal with any
one or more of Borrower s sureties, endorsers, or other guarantors on any terms or in any manner Lender may choose; (E) to determine
how, when and what application of payments and credits shall be made on the Indebtedness; (F) to apply such security and direct the order
or manner of sale thereof, including without limitation, any nonjudicial sale permitted by the terms of the controlling security agreement
or deed of trust, as Lender in its discretion may determine; (G) to sell, transfer, assign or grant participations in all or any part
of the Indebtedness; and (H) to assign or transfer this Guaranty in whole or in part.

request and not at the request of Lender; (C) Guarantor has full power, right and authority to enter into this Guaranty; (D) the provisions

the prior written consent of Lender, sell, lease, assign, encumber, hypothecate, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of Guarantor s assets, or any interest therein; (F) upon Lender s request, Guarantor will provide to Lender financial
and credit information in form acceptable to Lender, and all such financial information which currently has been, and all future financial
information which will be provided to Lender is and will be true and correct in all material respects and fairly present Guarantor s
financial condition as of the dates the financial information is provided; (G) no material adverse change has occurred in Guarantor s
financial condition since the date of the most recent financial statements provided to Lender and no event has occurred which may materially
adversely affect Guarantor s financial condition; (H) no litigation, claim, investigation, administrative proceeding or similar
action (including those for unpaid taxes) against Guarantor is pending or threatened; (I) Lender has made no representation to Guarantor
as to the creditworthiness of Borrower; and (J) Guarantor has established adequate means of obtaining from Borrower on a continuing basis
information regarding Borrower s financial condition. Guarantor agrees to keep adequately informed from such means of any facts,
events, or circumstances which might in any way affect Guarantor s risks under this Guaranty, and Guarantor further agrees that,
absent a request for information, Lender shall have no obligation to disclose to Guarantor any information or documents acquired by Lender
in the course of its relationship with Borrower. 

GUARANTOR S
WAIVERS. Except as prohibited by applicable law, Guarantor waives any right to require Lender (A) to continue lending money or to
extend other credit to Borrower; (B) to make any presentment, protest, demand, or notice of any kind, including notice of any nonpayment
of the Indebtedness or of any nonpayment related to any collateral, or notice of any action or nonaction on the part of Borrower, Lender,
any surety, endorser, or other guarantor in connection with the Indebtedness or in connection with the creation of new or additional
loans or obligations; (C) to resort for payment or to proceed directly or at once against any person, including Borrower or any other
guarantor; (D) to proceed directly against or exhaust any collateral held by Lender from Borrower, any other guarantor, or any other
person; (E) to give notice of the terms, time, and place of any public or private sale of personal property security held by Lender from
Borrower or to comply with any other applicable provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code; (F) to pursue any other remedy within Lender s
power; or (G) to commit any act or omission of any kind, or at any time, with respect to any matter whatsoever. 

Guarantor
also waives any and all rights or defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral including, but not limited to, any rights
or defenses arising by reason of (A) any one action or anti-deficiency law or any other law which may prevent
Lender from bringing any action, including a claim for deficiency, against Guarantor, before or after Lender s commencement or
completion of any foreclosure action, either judicially or by exercise of a power of sale; (B) any election of remedies by Lender which
destroys or otherwise adversely affects Guarantor s subrogation rights or Guarantor s rights to proceed against Borrower
for reimbursement, including without limitation, any loss of rights Guarantor may suffer by reason of any law limiting, qualifying, or
discharging the Indebtedness; (C) any disability or other defense of Borrower, of any other guarantor, or of any other person, or by

(D) any right to claim discharge of the Indebtedness on the basis of unjustified impairment of any collateral for the Indebtedness; (E)
any statute of limitations, if at any time any action or suit brought by Lender against Guarantor is commenced, there is outstanding
Indebtedness which is not barred by any applicable statute of limitations; or (F) any defenses given to guarantors at law or in equity
other than actual payment and performance of the Indebtedness. If payment is made by Borrower, whether voluntarily or otherwise, or by
any third party, on the Indebtedness and thereafter Lender is forced to remit the amount of that payment to Borrower s trustee
in bankruptcy or to any similar person under any federal or state bankruptcy law or law for the relief of debtors, the Indebtedness shall
be considered unpaid for the purpose of the enforcement of this Guaranty. 

Guarantor
further waives and agrees not to assert or claim at any time any deductions to the amount guaranteed under this Guaranty for any claim
of setoff, counterclaim, counter demand, recoupment or similar right, whether such claim, demand or right may be asserted by the Borrower,
the Guarantor, or both. 

GUARANTOR S
UNDERSTANDING WITH RESPECT TO WAIVERS. Guarantor warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with Guarantor s
full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that, under the circumstances, the waivers are reasonable and not contrary to
public policy or law. If any such waiver is determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waiver shall be effective
only to the extent permitted by law or public policy. 

RIGHT
OF SETOFF. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a right of setoff in all Guarantor s accounts with Lender
(whether checking, savings, or some other account). This includes all accounts Guarantor holds jointly with someone else and all accounts
Guarantor may open in the future. However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts for which setoff would
be prohibited by law. Guarantor authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to hold these funds if there is a default,
and Lender may apply the funds in these accounts to pay what Guarantor owes under the terms of this Guaranty. 

SUBORDINATION
OF BORROWER S DEBTS TO GUARANTOR. Guarantor agrees that the Indebtedness, whether now existing or hereafter created, shall
be superior to any claim that Guarantor may now have or hereafter acquire against Borrower, whether or not Borrower becomes insolvent.
Guarantor hereby expressly subordinates any claim Guarantor may have against Borrower, upon any account whatsoever, to any claim that
Lender may now or hereafter have against Borrower. In the event of insolvency and consequent liquidation of the assets of Borrower, through
bankruptcy, by an assignment for the benefit of creditors, by voluntary liquidation, or otherwise, the assets of Borrower applicable
to the payment of the claims of both Lender and Guarantor shall be paid to Lender and shall be first applied by Lender to the Indebtedness.
Guarantor does hereby assign to Lender all claims which it may have or acquire against Borrower or against any assignee or trustee in
bankruptcy of Borrower; provided however, that such assignment shall be effective only for the purpose of assuring to Lender full payment
in legal tender of the Indebtedness. If Lender so requests, any notes or credit agreements now or hereafter evidencing any debts or obligations
of Borrower to Guarantor shall be marked with a legend that the same are subject to this Guaranty and shall be delivered to Lender. Guarantor
agrees, and Lender is hereby authorized, in the name of Guarantor, from time to time to file financing statements and continuation statements
and to execute documents and to take such other actions as Lender deems necessary or appropriate to perfect, preserve and enforce its
rights under this Guaranty. 

MISCELLANEOUS
PROVISIONS. The following miscellaneous provisions are a part of this Guaranty: 

Amendments.

set forth in this Guaranty. No alteration of or amendment to this Guaranty shall be effective unless given in writing and signed by the

Attorneys 
Fees; Expenses. Guarantor agrees to pay upon demand all of Lender s costs and expenses, including Lender s reasonable
attorneys fees and Lender s legal expenses, incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Guaranty. Lender may hire
or pay someone else to help enforce this Guaranty, and Guarantor shall pay the costs and expenses of such enforcement. Costs and expenses
include Lender s reasonable attorneys fees and legal expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including reasonable attorneys 
fees and legal expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals,
and any anticipated post-judgment collection services. Guarantor also shall pay all court costs and such additional fees as may be directed

Caption
Headings. Caption headings in this Guaranty are for convenience purposes only and are not to be used to interpret or define the provisions
of this Guaranty. 

Governing
Law. This Guaranty will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of
the State of Minnesota without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. 

Integration.
 Guarantor further agrees that Guarantor has read and fully understands the terms of this Guaranty; Guarantor has had the opportunity
to be advised by Guarantor s attorney with respect to this Guaranty; the Guaranty fully reflects Guarantor s intentions and
parol evidence is not required to interpret the terms of this Guaranty. Guarantor hereby indemnifies and holds Lender harmless from all
losses, claims, damages, and costs (including Lender s attorneys fees) suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of any
breach by Guarantor of the warranties, representations and agreements of this paragraph. 

Interpretation.
 In all cases where there is more than one Borrower or Guarantor, then all words used in this Guaranty in the singular shall be deemed
to have been used in the plural where the context and construction so require; and where there is more than one Borrower named in this
Guaranty or when this Guaranty is executed by more than one Guarantor, the words Borrower and Guarantor respectively
shall mean all and any one or more of them. The words Guarantor, Borrower, and Lender include
the heirs, successors, assigns, and transferees of each of them. If a court finds that any provision of this Guaranty is not valid or
should not be enforced, that fact by itself will not mean that the rest of this Guaranty will not be valid or enforced. Therefore, a
court will enforce the rest of the provisions of this Guaranty even if a provision of this Guaranty may be found to be invalid or unenforceable.
If any one or more of Borrower or Guarantor are corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, or similar entities, it is not
necessary for Lender to inquire into the powers of Borrower or Guarantor or of the officers, directors, partners, managers, or other
agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such
powers shall be guaranteed under this Guaranty. 

Notices.
 Any notice required to be given under this Guaranty shall be given in writing, and, except for revocation notices by Guarantor, shall
be effective when actually delivered, when actually received by telefacsimile (unless otherwise required by law), when deposited with
a nationally recognized overnight courier, or, if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, as first class, certified or registered
mail postage prepaid, directed to the addresses shown near the beginning of this Guaranty. All revocation notices by Guarantor shall
be in writing and shall be effective upon delivery to Lender as provided in the section of this Guaranty entitled DURATION OF
GUARANTY. Any party may change its address for notices under this Guaranty by giving formal written notice to the other parties,
specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party s address. For notice purposes, Guarantor agrees to keep Lender
informed at all times of Guarantor s current address. Unless otherwise provided or required by law, if there is more than one Guarantor,
any notice given by Lender to any Guarantor is deemed to be notice given to all Guarantors. 

No
Waiver by Lender. Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Guaranty unless such waiver is given in writing
and signed by Lender. No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any
other right. A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Guaranty shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender s right otherwise
to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Guaranty. No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course of
dealing between Lender and Guarantor, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender s rights or of any of Guarantor s obligations
as to any future transactions. Whenever the consent of Lender is required under this Guaranty, the granting of such consent by Lender
in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances where such consent is required and in all cases such
consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Lender. 

Successors
and Assigns. Subject to any limitations stated in this Guaranty on transfer of Guarantor s interest, this Guaranty shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns. 

Waive
Jury. Lender and Guarantor hereby waive the right to any jury trial in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by either Lender
or Guarantor against the other.

WAIVERS. Grantor waives all requirements of presentment, protest, demand, and notice of dishonor or non-payment to Borrower or Grantor,
or any other party to the Indebtedness or the Collateral. Lender may do any of the following with respect to any obligation of any Borrower,
without first obtaining the consent of Grantor: (A) grant any extension of time for any payment, (B) grant any renewal, (C) permit any
modification of payment terms or other terms, or (D) exchange or release any Collateral or other security. No such act or failure to
act shall affect Lender s rights against Grantor or the Collateral. 

RIGHT
OF SETOFF. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a right of setoff in all Grantor s accounts with Lender
(whether checking, savings, or some other account). This includes all accounts Grantor holds jointly with someone else and all accounts
Grantor may open in the future. However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts for which setoff would
be prohibited by law. Grantor authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or setoff all sums owing on the
Indebtedness against any and all such accounts, and, at Lender s option, to administratively freeze all such accounts to allow
Lender to protect Lender s charge and setoff rights provided in this paragraph. 

GRANTOR S
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLATERAL. With respect to the Collateral, Grantor represents and promises to
Lender that: 

Ownership.
 Grantor is the lawful owner of the Collateral free and clear of all loans, liens, encumbrances, and claims except as disclosed to
and accepted by Lender in writing. 

Right
to Grant Security Interest. Grantor has the full right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to assign the Collateral
to Lender. 

No
Prior Assignment. Grantor has not previously granted a security interest in the Collateral to any other creditor. 

No
Further Transfer. Grantor shall not sell, assign, encumber, or otherwise dispose of any of Grantor s rights in the Collateral
except as provided in this Agreement. 

No
Defaults. There are no defaults relating to the Collateral, and there are no offsets or counterclaims to the same. Grantor will strictly
and promptly do everything required of Grantor under the terms, conditions, promises, and agreements contained in or relating to the
Collateral. 

Proceeds.
 Any and all replacement or renewal certificates, instruments, or other benefits or proceeds related to the Collateral that are received
by Grantor shall be held by Grantor in trust for Lender and immediately shall be delivered by Grantor to Lender to be held as part of
the Collateral. 

Validity;
Binding Effect. This Agreement is binding upon Grantor and Grantor s successors and assigns and is legally enforceable in accordance
with its terms.

Financing
Statements. Grantor authorizes Lender to file a UCC financing statement, or alternatively, a copy of this Agreement to perfect Lender s
security interest. At Lender s request, Grantor additionally agrees to sign all other documents that are necessary to perfect,
protect, and continue Lender s security interest in the Property. Grantor will pay all filing fees, title transfer fees, and other
fees and costs involved unless prohibited by law or unless Lender is required by law to pay such fees and costs. Grantor irrevocably
appoints Lender to execute documents necessary to transfer title if there is a default. Lender may file a copy of this Agreement as a
financing statement. 

LENDER S
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLATERAL. While this Agreement is in effect, Lender may retain the rights to possession
of the Collateral, together with any and all evidence of the Collateral, such as certificates or passbooks. This Agreement will remain
in effect until (a) there no longer is any Indebtedness owing to Lender; (b) all other obligations secured by this Agreement have been
fulfilled; and (c) Grantor, in writing, has requested from Lender a release of this Agreement. 

LENDER S
EXPENDITURES. If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender s interest in the Collateral or
if Grantor fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Grantor s
failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Grantor is required to discharge or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents,
Lender on Grantor s behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not
limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on
the Collateral and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving the Collateral. All such expenditures incurred or paid by
Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date
of repayment by Grantor. All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender s option, will (A) be payable
on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due
during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Note; or (C) be treated as a balloon
payment which will be due and payable at the Note s maturity. The Agreement also will secure payment of these amounts. Such right
shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon the occurrence of any Event of Default. 

LIMITATIONS
ON OBLIGATIONS OF LENDER. Lender shall use ordinary reasonable care in the physical preservation and custody of any certificate or
passbook for the Collateral but shall have no other obligation to protect the Collateral or its value. In particular, but without limitation,
Lender shall have no responsibility (A) for the collection or protection of any income on the Collateral; (B) for the preservation of
rights against issuers of the Collateral or against third persons; (C) for ascertaining any maturities, conversions, exchanges, offers,
tenders, or similar matters relating to the Collateral; nor (D) for informing the Grantor about any of the above, whether or not Lender
has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters. 

DEFAULT.
 Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: 

Payment
Default. Borrower fails to make any payment when due under the Indebtedness. 

Other
Defaults. Borrower or Grantor fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this
Agreement or in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in
any other agreement between Lender and Borrower or Grantor. 

Default
in Favor of Third Parties. Borrower, any guarantor or Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase
or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Borrower s,
any guarantor s or Grantor s property or ability to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or any of the
Related Documents. 

False
Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or Grantor or on Borrower s or
Grantor s behalf under this Agreement or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at
the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter. 

Defective
Collateralization. This Agreement or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any
collateral document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason. 

Insolvency.
 The dissolution or termination of Borrower s or Grantor s existence as a going business, the insolvency of Borrower or
Grantor, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Borrower s or Grantor s property, any assignment for the benefit of
creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against
Borrower or Grantor. 

Creditor
or Forfeiture Proceedings. Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession
or any other method, by any creditor of Borrower or Grantor or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the Indebtedness.
This includes a garnishment of any of Borrower s or Grantor s accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However,
this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Borrower or Grantor as to the validity or reasonableness of
the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Borrower or Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor
or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined
by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute. 

Events
Affecting Guarantor. Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any Guarantor of any of the Indebtedness or Guarantor dies
or becomes incompetent or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness. 

Adverse
Change. A material adverse change occurs in Borrower s or Grantor s financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect
of payment or performance of the Indebtedness is impaired. 

Cure
Provisions. If any default, other than a default in payment, is curable and if Grantor has not been given a notice of a breach of
the same provision of this Agreement within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Grantor, after Lender sends written
notice to Borrower demanding cure of such default: (1) cures the default within ten (10) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than
ten (10) days, immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender s sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default
and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical. 

RIGHTS
AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, or at any time thereafter, Lender may exercise any one or more
of the following rights and remedies, in addition to any rights or remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise: 

Accelerate
Indebtedness. Lender may declare all Indebtedness of Borrower to Lender immediately due and payable, without notice of any kind to
Borrower or Grantor. 

Application
of Account Proceeds. Lender may take directly all funds in the Account and apply them to the Indebtedness. If the Account is subject
to an early withdrawal penalty, that penalty shall be deducted from the Account before its application to the Indebtedness, whether the
Account is with Lender or some other institution. Any excess funds remaining after application of the Account proceeds to the Indebtedness
will be paid to Borrower or Grantor as the interests of Borrower or Grantor may appear. Borrower agrees, to the extent permitted by law,
to pay any deficiency after application of the proceeds of the Account to the Indebtedness. Lender also shall have all the rights of
a secured party under the Minnesota Uniform Commercial Code, even if the Account is not otherwise subject to such Code concerning security
interests, and the parties to this Agreement agree that the provisions of the Code giving rights to a secured party shall nonetheless
be a part of this Agreement.

Transfer
Title. Lender may effect transfer of title upon sale of all or part of the Collateral. For this purpose, Grantor irrevocably appoints
Lender as Grantor s attorney-in-fact to execute endorsements, assignments and instruments in the name of Grantor and each of them
(if more than one) as shall be necessary or reasonable. 

Other
Rights and Remedies. Lender shall have and may exercise any or all of the rights and remedies of a secured creditor under the provisions
of the Minnesota Uniform Commercial Code, at law, in equity, or otherwise. 

Deficiency
Judgment. If permitted by applicable law, Lender may obtain a judgment for any deficiency remaining in the Indebtedness due to Lender
after application of all amounts received from the exercise of the rights provided in this section. 

Election
of Remedies. Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender s rights and remedies, whether evidenced by this
Agreement or by any other writing, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to pursue
any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation
of Grantor under this Agreement, after Grantor s failure to perform, shall not affect Lender s right to declare a default
and exercise its remedies. 

Cumulative
Remedies. All of Lender s rights and remedies, whether evidenced by this Agreement or by any other writing, shall be cumulative
and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy,
and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Grantor under this Agreement, after Grantor s
failure to perform, shall not affect Lender s right to declare a default and to exercise its remedies. 

MISCELLANEOUS
PROVISIONS. The following miscellaneous provisions are a part of this Agreement: 

Amendments.
 This Agreement, together with any Related Documents, constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties as to the
matters set forth in this Agreement. No alteration of or amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless given in writing and signed
by the party or parties sought to be charged or bound by the alteration or amendment. 

Attorneys 
Fees; Expenses. Grantor agrees to pay upon demand all of Lender s costs and expenses, including Lender s reasonable attorneys 
fees and Lender s legal expenses, incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement. Lender may hire or pay someone
else to help enforce this Agreement, and Grantor shall pay the costs and expenses of such enforcement. Costs and expenses include Lender s
reasonable attorneys fees and legal expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including reasonable attorneys fees and
legal expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals, and any
anticipated post-judgment collection services. Grantor also shall pay all court costs and such additional fees as may be directed by
the court. 

Caption
Headings. Caption headings in this Agreement are for convenience purposes only and are not to be used to interpret or define the
provisions of this Agreement. 

Governing
Law. This Agreement will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of
the State of Minnesota without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. This Agreement has been accepted by Lender in the State of
Minnesota. 

Joint
and Several Liability. All obligations of Borrower and Grantor under this Agreement shall be joint and several, and all references
to Grantor shall mean each and every Grantor, and all references to Borrower shall mean each and every Borrower. This means that each
Borrower and Grantor signing below is responsible for all obligations in this Agreement. Where any one or more of the parties is a corporation,
partnership, limited liability company or similar entity, it is not necessary for Lender to inquire into the powers of any of the officers,
directors, partners, members, or other agents acting or purporting to act on the entity s behalf, and any obligations made or created
in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed under this Agreement. 

No
Waiver by Lender. Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Agreement unless such waiver is given in writing
and signed by Lender. No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any
other right. A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Agreement shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender s right otherwise
to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course of
dealing between Lender and Grantor, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender s rights or of any of Grantor s obligations
as to any future transactions. Whenever the consent of Lender is required under this Agreement, the granting of such consent by Lender
in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances where such consent is required and in all cases such
consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Lender. 

Notices.
 Any notice required to be given under this Agreement shall be given in writing, and shall be effective when actually delivered, when
actually received by telefacsimile (unless otherwise required by law), when deposited with a nationally recognized overnight courier,
or, if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, as first class, certified or registered mail postage prepaid, directed to the
addresses shown near the beginning of this Agreement. Any party may change its address for notices under this Agreement by giving formal
written notice to the other parties, specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party s address. For notice purposes,
Grantor agrees to keep Lender informed at all times of Grantor s current address. Unless otherwise provided or required by law,
if there is more than one Grantor, any notice given by Lender to any Grantor is deemed to be notice given to all Grantors. 

Power
of Attorney. Grantor hereby appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, irrevocably, with full power of substitution
to do the following: (1) to demand, collect, receive, receipt for, sue and recover all sums of money or other property which may now
or hereafter become due, owing or payable from the Collateral; (2) to execute, sign and endorse any and all claims, instruments, receipts,
checks, drafts or warrants issued in payment for the Collateral; (3) to settle or compromise any and all claims arising under the Collateral,
and in the place and stead of Grantor, to execute and deliver its release and settlement for the claim; and (4) to file any claim or
claims or to take any action or institute or take part in any proceedings, either in its own name or in the name of Grantor, or otherwise,
which in the discretion of Lender may seem to be necessary or advisable. This power is given as security for the Indebtedness, and the
authority hereby conferred is and shall be irrevocable and shall remain in full force and effect until renounced by Lender. 

Severability.
 If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any circumstance,
that finding shall not make the offending provision illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any other circumstance. If feasible, the
offending provision shall be considered modified so that it becomes legal, valid and enforceable. If the offending provision cannot be
so modified, it shall be considered deleted from this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by law, the illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability
of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. 

Successors
and Assigns. Subject to any limitations stated in this Agreement on transfer of Grantor s interest, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns. If ownership of the Collateral becomes vested in
a person other than Grantor, Lender, without notice to Grantor, may deal with Grantor s successors with reference to this Agreement
and the Indebtedness by way of forbearance or extension without releasing Grantor from the obligations of this Agreement or liability
under the Indebtedness.
