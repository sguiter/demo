Level 2 derivative instrument which is an interest rate swap (see Note 4 Financial Commitments) classified as prepaid expenses and other at September 30, 2024 and as other assets, net at December 31, 2023. The fair value of the interest rate swap was determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipt was based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. Credit valuation adjustments were incorporated to appropriately reflect both the Company s nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. The carrying amount of receivables, payables and other amounts arising out of the normal course of business approximates fair value because of the relatively short maturity of such instruments. The carrying amount of the Company s short-term and long-term borrowings, which are considered Level 2 liabilities, approximates fair value based on current rates and terms available to the Company for similar debt.

The discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect the financial condition and results of operations of our company as a whole.

 OVERVIEW 
 Skechers continued 2024 by setting a quarterly sales record of 2.35 billion, an increase of 15.9 compared to the same period as the prior year, driven by strong demand for our strong portfolio of innovative footwear. We experienced growth across all regions and sales increased in both segments led by Wholesale, with an increase of 18 internationally and 26 domestically. Diluted earnings per share were 1.26, an increase of 0.33 per share compared to the prior year. The broad-based growth is the result of our dedication to delivering exceptional product for consumers of all ages and interests. 
 We make efforts to deploy our capital in meaningful ways while maintaining a strong financial position and sufficient liquidity. On July 23, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new three-year share repurchase program effective July 25, 2024, pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to 1.0 billion in shares of its Class A common stock. During the third quarter, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of its Class A common stock at a cost of 90.0 million. 
 We focus our initiatives with targeted and effective demand creation. In the quarter ending September 30, 2024, we launched Skechers x John Deere, delivering a product that incorporates the iconic John Deere branding with Skechers comfort technologies for agricultural professionals, construction workers, outdoor enthusiasts, and others. In our Performance footwear, Skechers Football boots released globally in July, shortly followed by the global release of Skechers Basketball. 
 18 

As we continue to drive purchase intent and brand awareness, and increase our offering of Skechers products globally, we remain focused on building efficiencies within our business to scale for profitable growth. Our extensive product offering, best-in-class partnerships with our distribution network and strong global demand provide us confidence as we move toward our goal of 10 billion in annual sales by 2026. 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THIRD QUARTER 
 We have two reportable segments, Wholesale and Direct-to-Consumer. Wholesale includes sales to department stores, family shoe stores, specialty running and sporting goods retailers, and big box club stores; franchisee and licensee third-party store operators; dedicated e-commerce retailers; and international distributors. Direct-to-Consumer includes direct sales to consumers through an integrated retail format of company-owned physical stores and digital platforms and hosted digital marketplaces in select international markets.

Sales 
 Sales increased 322.7 million, or 15.9 , to 2.3 billion compared to 2.0 billion as a result of a 16.4 increase internationally and a 15.3 increase domestically. Wholesale increased 20.6 and Direct-to-Consumer increased 9.6 . Sales increased overall due to higher sales volume, partially offset by lower average selling prices. 
 Gross margin 
 Gross margin decreased 80 basis points to 52.1 compared to 52.9 , primarily due to lower average selling prices driven by higher promotions. 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses increased 130.9 million, or 15.2 , to 989.6 million, and as a percentage of sales decreased 30 basis points to 42.2 . Selling expenses increased 32.9 million, or 18.4 , to 211.2 million, primarily due to higher brand demand creation expenditures . General and administrative expenses increased 98.0 million, or 14.4 , to 778.5 million. The increased expenses were primarily driven by increases in labor costs of 48.4 million and facility related costs of 23.5 million, including rent and depreciation, driven by retail expansion and corporate compensation. 
 Other income (expense) 
 Other income was 11.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an expense of 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 18.9 million was primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in interest income.

Income taxes

Our income tax expense and effective income tax rate are significantly impacted by the mix of our domestic and foreign earnings before income taxes. In the foreign jurisdictions in which we have operations, the applicable statutory rates range from 0 to 35 , and on average is significantly lower than the U.S. federal and state combined statutory rate of 25 . For the quarter, the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the release of certain allowances and other provision adjustments. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") has issued various proposals that would change long-standing global tax principles, namely its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 for large companies. While some member countries have adopted the framework, which generally provides for a 15 minimum effective tax rate for multinational enterprises, in every jurisdiction in which they operate, we do not anticipate that this will have a material impact on our tax provision or effective tax rate in 2024. We will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the Pillar Two framework on future periods. 
 Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest in net earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 
 Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest represents the share of net earnings that is attributable to our joint venture partners. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest decreased 4.4 million to 16.1 million, compared to 20.5 million in the prior year, due to lower earnings by our joint ventures, predominantly in China.

Selling expenses increased 109.6 million, or 22.2 , to 603.5 million, primarily due to higher brand demand creation expenditures . General and administrative expenses increased 284.3 million, or 14.5 , to 2.2 billion.

 Other income 
 Other income was 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 2.5 million was primarily due an increase in interest income, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.

Our provision for income tax expense and effective income tax rate are significantly impacted by the mix of our domestic and foreign earnings (loss) before income taxes. In the foreign jurisdictions in which we have operations, the applicable statutory rates range from 0 to 35 , which on average are generally significantly lower than the U.S. federal and state combined statutory rate of approximately 25 .

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest decreased 5.1 million to 74.1 million, compared to 79.2 million in the prior year, due to lower earnings by our joint ventures, predominantly in China.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity outlook 
 We have cash and cash equivalents of 1,354.1 million at September 30, 2024. Amounts held outside the U.S. were 1,281.0 million, or 94.6 and 635.5 million was available for repatriation to the U.S. at September 30, 2024, without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. On October 18, 2024, the Company repatriated 400.0 million of foreign earnings to the U.S., and we expect to use these funds to support ongoing working capital needs. 
 At September 30, 2024, we have unused credit capacity of 571.1 million on our revolving credit facility, with an additional 250.0 million available through an accordion feature. We believe that anticipated cash flows from operations, existing cash and investments balances, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and current financing arrangements will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund our anticipated working capital and capital requirements for the next twelve months. 
 Cash Flows 
 Our working capital at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 2.3 billion. Our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were 1,354.1 million, compared to 1,189.9 million at December 31, 2023. Capital expenditures were 283.4 million and we repurchased 210.1 million of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our primary source of operating cash are collections from customers. Our primary uses of cash are working capital, selling, general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures. 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 454.7 million compared to 918.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 464.0 million decrease in operating cash flows primarily resulted from changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in net earnings. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 331.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 309.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 22.1 million increase was due to net investment activity of 47.8 million and increased capital expenditures of 44.7 million, partially offset by the acquisitions of 70.4 million in the prior year. 
 Our capital investments remain focused on supporting our strategic growth priorities, growing our Direct-to-Consumer business, as well as expanding the presence of our brand internationally. Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 283.4 million, which included 128.5 million related to investments in our retail stores and direct-to-consumer technologies; 70.1 million related to the expansion of our global distribution infrastructure; and 43.5 million of investments in our new corporate offices. We expect our annual capital expenditures for 2024 to be approximately 375.0 to 400.0 million, which is primarily related to new stores, added omnichannel capabilities and incremental distribution capacity in key markets. We expect to fund ongoing capital expenses through a combination of available cash and borrowings. 
 22 

Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 27.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used of 118.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 146.3 million is the result of increased net proceeds from short-term borrowings of 180.5 million and increased proceeds and decreased repayments from long-term borrowing of 125.5 million. These increases were partially offset by repurchases of common stock of 110.0 million, net payments related to stock compensation of 28.8 million, and distributions to noncontrolling interests of 22.4 million. 
 Capital Resources and Prospective Capital Requirements 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On July 23, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program effective July 25, 2024, pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to 1.0 billion in shares of its Class A common stock. This repurchase program expires on July 25, 2027, does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of shares and replaced the prior share repurchase program authorization. Remaining repurchase authorization under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program was terminated upon commencement of the new program. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 At September 30, 2024, outstanding borrowings were 628.9 million, of which 251.9 million relates to loans for our domestic and China distribution centers, 168.8 million relates to our operations in China, and the remainder relates to our international operations. Our long-term debt obligations contain both financial and non-financial covenants, including cross-default provisions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our short-term and long-term borrowings as of the date of this quarterly report. See Note 4 Financial Commitments of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies and estimates did not change materially during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes from the information previously reported under Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods and that such information is accumulated and communicated to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective due to the un-remediated material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the material weakness, our management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 As previously reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the information technology general controls related to segregation of duties within an information system relevant to the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Under the direction of the Audit Committee, our management is in the process of designing and implementing effective internal control measures to remediate the material weakness. These efforts include: 
 Rationalizing user access roles and privileges; 

Implementing user activity monitoring; and 

Formalizing additional compensating control activities over the completeness and accuracy of data provided by the affected system. 

23 

The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the enhanced controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the related controls are effective. We will monitor the effectiveness of the remediation plan and refine the remediation plan as appropriate. 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 Other than the ongoing remediation efforts described above, there were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 LIMITATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS 
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Assessments of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements as a result of error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PAR T II OTHER I NFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Michael Conte v. Robert Greenberg, et al. On July 21, 2022, Skechers and certain past and present members of the Board of Directors were sued by a stockholder on behalf of our company in a derivative action in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, Case No. 2022-0633, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, breach of duty of candor and breach of contract in connection with certain executive officers personal use of two company-owned aircraft. The complaint seeks actual damages in favor of Skechers sustained as the alleged result of defendants alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, judgment directing our company to take all necessary actions to reform and improve its corporate governance practices, termination of certain executive officers for allegedly violating their employment agreements, judgment directing the sale of one of the company-owned aircraft and attorneys , accountants and experts fees, costs and expenses. The defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint. On February 2, 2024, the court granted the motions and thereafter dismissed the complaint with prejudice as to all named past and present director-defendants. On February 22, 2024, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. The briefing on the appeal has been completed. The court originally set a hearing date for the appeal of October 9, 2024, which has been continued to a date to be determined. We cannot predict the outcome of the appeal or any further related legal proceedings or whether an adverse result in such proceedings would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position. 
 Nike, Inc. v. Skechers USA, Inc. On November 6, 2023, Nike filed an action against our company in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. 2:23-CV-09346, alleging that certain Skechers shoe designs infringe the claims of six Nike utility patents that purportedly cover Nike s Flyknit technologies. Nike seeks injunctive relief, damages (including treble damages), pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and costs. On January 12, 2024, we answered Nike s complaint, denying the allegations, and filed counterclaims seeking declarations of invalidity of the asserted patents, and non-infringement. The District Court held a claim construction hearing on September 20, 2024, and we are awaiting the Court's ruling. The Court has also set a deadline of December 20, 2024 for the filing of summary judgment motions. Trial is scheduled to begin September 15, 2025. While it is too early to predict the outcome of the District Court proceedings or whether an adverse result would have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position, we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend this matter vigorously. 
 Other than the matters as described above, there have been no material developments with respect to the information previously reported under Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material developments with respect to the information previously reported under Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
