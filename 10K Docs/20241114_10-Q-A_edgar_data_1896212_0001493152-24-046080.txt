CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024 contains forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only
on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections,
anticipated events and trends, the economy, and other future conditions. This includes, without limitation, statements regarding the
financial position and the plans and objectives of management for our future operations. Such statements can be identified by the fact
that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. When used in this Quarterly Report, words such as anticipate, 
 believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, 
 may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, 
 should, strive, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but
the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Factors that could materially affect our business operations
and financial performance and condition include, but are not limited to, those risks and uncertainties described herein under Item
1A. Risk Factors, those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under Item 1A.
Risk Factors, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). You are urged to consider these
factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements are based on information available to us as of the filing date of this Quarterly Report. Unless required
by law, we do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or future events or otherwise.
You should, however, review the risk factors we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the SEC after the date of
this Quarterly Report. 

This
Quarterly Report may also contain market data related to our business and industry. These market data include projections that are based
on a number of assumptions. If these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, actual results may differ from the projections based on these
assumptions. As a result, our markets may not grow at the rates projected by these data, or at all. The failure of these markets to grow
at these projected rates may harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.

 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

million. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million,
respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had net losses of 
million and 
million, respectively, and cash used in operating activities of 
million and 
million, respectively. Management has determined that it does not have sufficient cash and other sources of liquidity to fund its current
business plan. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least
the next 12 months from the financial statement filing date. 

On
March 4, 2024, the Company received a Commitment Letter in the amount of million,
subject to agreement and definition documentation, from Corvus Capital Limited Corvus ), a major stockholder and
related party. The facility allows for single draws of up to ,
and limits draw requests to in
any 30-day period. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had not received any proceeds from the million
commitment. 

On August 5, 2024, the
Company entered into a Senior Secured Promissory Note (the Note with Nirland Limited Nirland ),
pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the Nirland the Note in the original principal amount of 
(the Note ), inclusive of a 
original issuance discount. Of the total amount of the Note, 
was issued upon execution of the Note . In connection with the Note, the Company issued the Purchaser shares of the
Company s common stock on August 6, 2024. The balance of 
will be paid after the shares have been registered for resale. The Note bears interest at a rate of 
per annum, accruing daily on a 365-day basis, payable monthly in arrears as cash, or accrued at the Nirland s discretion. The Note
matures on . 

The
Company s expectation is to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and will need additional
funding to support its current business plan. Management s plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include
the pursuit of additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings. There is no assurance that such funding
will be available when needed or on acceptable terms. If additional funding is not available when required, the Company would need to
delay or curtail its operations and its research and development activities until such funding is received, all of which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition. 

These
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include adjustments to reflect
the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Other
Risks and Uncertainties 

The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, uncertainties related to
commercialization of competitor products, regulatory approvals, dependence on key products, dependence on key customers and suppliers,
and protection of intellectual property rights. Clinical assets currently under development will require significant additional research
and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These
efforts will require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel, infrastructure, and extensive compliance and reporting
capabilities. Even if the Company s efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant
revenue from royalties or product sales. 

The
Company licenses clinical assets from AstraZeneca. See Note 13 and Note 17. If there is a breach or other termination
of such agreements, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, operating results,
and prospects. While the Company holds its own intellectual
property outside of the scope of these agreements, termination of such agreements could adversely affect the business and ability to
commercialize our clinical assets. 

Nasdaq
Listing Deficiencies 

Notice of Delisting or Failure
to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard 

On May 28, 2024, the Company received a notice (the Notice it was expecting from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company
that, due to the previously disclosed resignation of Ms. Jennifer McNealey from the Company s Board of Directors (the Board and from all committees on which she served, the Company, effective as of such date of resignation, was not in compliance with Nasdaq s
independent audit committee requirements as set forth in Listing Rule 5605 as a result of the audit committee being comprised of only
two independent directors. The Company has until the earlier of its next annual meeting of stockholders or May 13, 2025 or, if the
next annual meeting of stockholders is held before November 12, 2024, then the Company must evidence compliance no later than November
12, 2024. The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company s securities on Nasdaq. The Company intends to regain
compliance with the requirement that the audit committee be comprised of at least three independent directors prior to the expiration
of the cure period provided pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(4). 

Notice
of Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule 

On
August 12, 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of the
Nasdaq notifying the Company that for the last 30 consecutive business days the closing bid price for the Company s common stock
had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5450(a)(1) (the Bid Price Rule ). The deficiency letter does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company s
common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market. 

In
accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) (the Compliance Period Rule ), the Company has been provided an initial
period of 180 calendar days, or until February 10, 2025 (the Compliance Date ), to regain compliance with the Bid Price
Rule. If, at any time before the Compliance Date, the closing bid price for the Company s common stock closes at or more
for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days as required under the Compliance Period Rule, the Staff will provide written notification
to the Company that it complies with the Bid Price Rule, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend this 10 day period pursuant
to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(H). 

If
the Company does not regain compliance by February 10, 2025, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period
if it applies to transfer the listing of its common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market. To qualify, the Company would be required to
meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of its publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the
Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement, and provide written notice of its intention to cure the
minimum bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. If the Nasdaq staff determines that the Company will not be able to
cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible for such additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that
the Company s common stock will be subject to delisting. The Company would have the right to appeal a determination to delist its
common stock, and the common stock would remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Market until the appeal process is complete. There can be
no assurance that, if the Company does appeal the delisting determination by the Staff to the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel, that
such appeal would be successful. 

The
Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance
with the Bid Price Rule, which could include effecting a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will
be able to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. 

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies 

(or approximately ), which exceeds the country s deposit limit of 
(approximately ). The Company s U.S. depository bank participates in the Demand Deposit Marketplace program, insuring deposits
up to million by sweeping amounts in excess of the deposit insurance limit among participating banks. The Company has not
experienced any losses on any accounts through the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

The
Company s Level 1 assets consist of cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying balance sheets, convertible notes payable and
the value of accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 

Warrants 

The Company determines the accounting classification of warrants as either liability or equity by first assessing
whether the Warrants meet liability classification in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ).
Under ASC 480, a financial instrument that embodies an unconditional obligation, or a financial instrument other than an outstanding share
that embodies a conditional obligation, that the issuer must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares must be classified
as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) if, at inception, the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly
on any one of the following: (a) a fixed monetary amount known at inception; (b) variations in something other than the fair value of
the issuer s equity shares; or (c) variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares.
If financial instruments, such as the warrants, are not required to be classified as liabilities under ASC 480, the Company assesses whether
such instruments are indexed to the Company s own stock under ASC 815-40. In order for an instrument to be considered indexed to
an entity s own stock, its settlement amount must always equal the difference between the following: (a) the fair value of a fixed
number of the Company s equity shares, and (b) a fixed monetary amount or a fixed amount of a debt instrument issued by the Company. 

Equity classified warrants are recorded in stockholders deficit and liability classified warrants are recorded
as liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The liability classified warrants are remeasured each period with changes recorded
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 

As of June 30, 2024, the Company
had outstanding warrants that are classified as a liability within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the warrant
liability is determined each balance sheet date based on Level 2 inputs as such inputs are based on observable inputs other than quoted
prices. The warrant liability is valued using a Black-Scholes model, with the most judgmental non-observable input being the volatility
measure. Changes in the assumptions around the volatility can cause significant changes in the estimated fair value of the warrant liability.
See Note 4 for further information on the Company s financial liabilities carried at fair value. 

During
the sixth months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued warrants that met the criteria to be classified within stockholders deficit
within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the warrants was determined by using a Black-Scholes model, with
the most judgmental non-observable input being the volatility measure. Changes in the assumptions around the volatility could have caused
significant changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants. See Note 14 for further information on the warrants classified within
stockholders deficit. 

Share
Based Compensation 

The
Company accounts for share based compensation arrangements granted to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation: Stock
Compensation, by measuring the grant date fair value of the award and recognizing the resulting expense over the period
during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award. The grant date fair value of stock options is determined

Revision
of Previously Issued Financial Statements: June 30, 2023 

In
connection with the preparation of the Company s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the
Company s management identified errors in its previously issued unaudited financial statements as of and for the three months
and six months ended June 30, 2023 with respect to how certain expenses relating to the Merger were previously expensed and that as
part of the Company s annual audit it was determined that such expenses should have been capitalized and subsequently recorded
against equity and restated such quarterly period in the December 31, 2023 Form 10-K. The accounting for legal costs was deemed to
be specific incremental costs directly attributable to the Merger and concurrent PIPE financing (See Note 3). Management has
evaluated this correction to the accounting treatment of such costs, which overstated net loss, additional paid in capital, and accumulated deficit and understated
prepaid expense, and concluded it was material to the prior quarterly periods, individually and in the aggregate. Additionally, certain items included in the comparative financial statements
for the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

In
connection with the preparation of the Company s financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company s management identified errors in its previously issued unaudited financial statements as of and for the three
months and six months ended June 30, 2024, with respect to how certain accrued expenses were accounted for in comparative three and
six months ended June 30, 2023. The error relates to the Company inaccurately estimating accrued professional fees incurred in
connection with the Merger as of June 30, 2023. Management has evaluated this correction to the accounting treatment of such costs, which overstated general and
administrative expense, other income (expense), net loss, accumulated deficit, and accrued professional fees, and concluded it was
not material to the prior periods, individually and in the aggregate. 

Additionally,
certain items included in the comparative financial statements for the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current

Options 

The
Company estimates the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company
then recognizes the grant date fair value of each option as compensation expense ratably using the straight-line attribution method over
the service period (generally the vesting period). The Black-Scholes model incorporates the following assumptions: 

Expected
 volatility the Company estimates the volatility of the share price of their peer companies at the date of grant using a look-back 
 period which coincides with the expected term, defined below. The Company believes using a look-back period which coincides
 with the expected term is the most appropriate measure for determining expected volatility. 

Expected
 term the Company estimates the expected term using the simplified method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
 No. 107, Share-Based Payment. 

Risk-free
 interest rate the Company estimates the risk- free interest rate using the U.S. Treasury Yield curve for periods equal to
 the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant. 

Dividends
 the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero because the Company has not declared nor paid a cash dividend, nor are
 there any plans to declare a dividend. 

The
Company did not grant stock options during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 or June 30, 2023. 

The
Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur, which may result in the reversal of compensation costs in subsequent periods as the forfeitures
arise.

exercise of the warrants included in the private placement units) were not transferable, assignable, or saleable until 30 days after
the completion of a Merger, subject to certain exceptions. 

In
connection with the closing of the Merger on September 22, 2023, the Equity Classified Warrants were amended to entitle each holder to
purchase one share of the Company s Common Stock. 

The
Equity Classified Warrants became exercisable 30 days after the Closing Date of the Merger. The Equity Classified Warrants will expire
five years after the Closing Date of the Merger or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The
Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of an Equity Classified Warrant and will
have no obligation to settle such exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Common
Stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations
described below with respect to registration. No Equity Classified Warrant will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue
shares of Common Stock upon exercise unless the Common Stock issuable upon such exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to
be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the Equity Classified Warrant. In the event
that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to an Equity Classified Warrant, the holder
of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will
we be required to net cash settle any Equity Classified Warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the
exercised Equity Classified Warrant, the purchaser of a unit containing such Equity Classified Warrant will have paid the full purchase
price for the unit solely for the share of Common Stock underlying such unit. 

Conduit
may call the Publicly Traded Warrants in whole and not in part, at a price of per warrant, 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each Publicly Traded Warrant holder; and 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
 dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing once
 the Publicly Traded Warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption to the warrant
 holders. 

If
and when the Publicly Traded Warrants become redeemable by Conduit, Conduit may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of
shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Publicly Traded Warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable
state blue sky laws or Conduit are unable to effect such registration or qualification. Conduit will use its best efforts to register
or qualify such shares of Common Stock under the blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the Publicly Traded
Warrants were offered by Conduit in the offering. 

The
Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Publicly Traded Warrants, except that such warrants will be exercisable for cash or on
a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and will not be redeemable by Conduit, in each case so long as they are still held by
the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. 

The
warrants issued in March 2024 (the March 2024 Warrants are not exercisable until one year after their date of
issuance. Each March 2024 Warrant is exercisable into one share of the Company s Common Stock at a price per share of

Liability
Classified Warrants 

As
discussed in Note 3, warrants were issued to the PIPE Investors as of the closing of the Merger pursuant to subscription agreements.
The warrants provide the PIPE Investors the right to purchase up to shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of .
Additionally, on the Closing Date of the Merger, the Company issued warrants to A.G.P. (the A.G.P. Warrants for
services provided directly related to the Merger. The warrants provide AGP the right to purchase up to shares of Common Stock
at an exercise price of per share. 

The
Liability Classified Warrants contain materially the same terms and are exercisable for a period of five years, beginning on October
22, 2023. 

The
PIPE Warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option. The PIPE Warrants are not redeemable by
the Company. 

The
A.G.P. Warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option. The Company may call the A.G.P. Warrants
for redemption, in whole and not in part, at any time after the A.G.P. Warrants become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at
a price of per A.G.P. Warrant, 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
 dividends, recapitalizations and other similar events) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period commencing once the
 A.G.P. Warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders;
 and 

provided
 there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the A.G.P. Warrants for
 each day in the 30 trading day period and continuing each thereafter until the redemption date. 

These warrants are classified as derivative liabilities because they do not meet the criteria in ASC 815-40 to be considered
indexed to the entity s own stock as the warrants could be settled for an amount that is not equal to the difference between the
fair value of a fixed number of the entity s shares and a fixed monetary amount. The Liability Classified Warrants are initially
measured at fair value based on the price of the Publicly Traded Warrants and are remeasured at fair value at subsequent financial reporting
period end dates and upon exercise (see Note 6 for additional information regarding fair value). 

As
June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the consolidated balance sheets contained derivative warrant liabilities of and 
million, respectively. 

million and, as a result of the completion
of the Business Combination, to be issued million shares of common stock. The potential contingency is not considered probable or
reasonable estimable as of the financial statement issuance date and no loss contingency accruals have been incurred in the accompanying
financial statements. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. Regardless of its outcome, the litigation may impact our business
due to, among other things, defense legal cost and the diversion of the attention of our management. 

Leases 

On
March 7, 2024, the Company entered into a lease agreement with respect to approximately square feet of space in Cambridge, England,
for a lease term commencing in March 2024 and ending in January 2027. The Company recorded a right-of-use asset of million and corresponding
lease liability of million, using an incremental borrowing rate of . The Company classified million of the lease liability
as short-term and million of the lease liability as long-term as of June 30, 2024. 

million, and (iii) will pay AstraZeneca a percentage (on a tiered basis) of any amounts it may receive in connection with a grant of
a sublicense (subject to various customary exceptions). 

AstraZeneca
has been granted a right of first negotiation to develop, manufacture, and commercialize a Licensed Product if Conduit receives an
offer for, or solicits, a transaction where a third party would obtain the right to develop, manufacture, or commercialize a
Licensed Product. If AstraZeneca exercises such right, the parties will negotiate in good faith for an agreed period of time on an
exclusive basis. If Conduit intends to commercialize any Licensed Product itself, it shall discuss in good faith the appropriate royalty
to be paid to AstraZeneca, subject to a low double digit royalty floor. 

AstraZeneca agreed to transfer to Conduit has the right to purchase all quantities of existing inventory of Licensed
Products including up to 450kg of AZD1656 at pre-agreed prices, which the Company believes would be sufficient to commercial launch,
assuming all clinical trials were successfully completed and regulatory approvals granted. 

Either
party may terminate the License Agreement for material breach (subject to a cure period) or insolvency of the other party. The Company
may terminate the License Agreement for convenience (in its entirety or on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis). In addition,
AstraZeneca may terminate the License Agreement in certain circumstances, including (but not limited to) the Company ceasing development
of all Licensed Products (subject to certain exceptions for normal pauses or gaps between clinical studies). 

In
connection with the execution of the License Agreement, the Company and AstraZeneca entered into a Stock Issuance Agreement, dated
August 7, 2024 (the Issuance Agreement ), whereby the Company has issued AstraZeneca 
shares of the Company s Common Stock. The Issuance Agreement provides AstraZeneca with resale registration rights for such shares. 

On August 5,
2024, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Promissory Note (the Note with Nirland Limited (the
 Nirland ), a related party of the Company, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the Nirland the Note in
the original principal amount of 
(the Note ), inclusive of a 
original issuance discount. Of the total amount of the Note, 
was issued upon execution of the Note and the balance of 
will be paid after the Closing Common Stock, defined below, has been registered for resale. The Note bears interest at a rate of 
per annum, accruing daily on a 365-day basis, payable monthly in arrears as cash, or accrued at the Nirland s discretion. . 

The Company has certain
obligations to mandatorily prepay the Note, and any accrued interest, with portions of any proceeds received in connection with future
financings. The Company may prepay the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Note with no fee. Until the Note is no longer
outstanding, Nirland has a right of first refusal to participate, in an amount up to 100 , with certain exceptions, in any future
equity or debt offering of the Company.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and the related notes included under Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this
 Quarterly Report as well as the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that was filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024. Certain information
contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The
following discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of
various factors, including those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors or in other parts of this Quarterly
Report . Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the
future. Conduit Pharmaceuticals Limited entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with
Murphy Canyon Acquisition Corp. MURF on November 8, 2022. The transaction contemplated by the terms of the Merger
Agreement was completed on September 22, 2023 (the Merger ), in conjunction with which MURF changed its name to Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc.
(hereafter referred to, collectively with is subsidiaries as Conduit , the Company , we ,
 us or our , unless the context otherwise requires). 

Overview 

Conduit
has developed a unique business model that allows it to act as a conduit to bring clinical assets from pharmaceutical companies
and develop new treatments for patients. Our novel approach addresses unmet medical need and lengthens the intellectual property for
our existing assets through cutting-edge solid-form technology and then commercialize these products with life science companies. 

We
are led by highly experienced pharma executives, Dr. Freda Lewis-Hall, former Chief Medical Officer of Pfizer Inc., the Chair of our
Board of Directors, and Dr. David Tapolczay, former Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom-based medical research charity LifeArc,
our Chief Executive Officer. 

While
simultaneously leveraging the capabilities of our Cambridge laboratory facility and highly experienced team of solid-form experts to
extend or develop proprietary solid-form intellectual property for our existing and future clinical assets. Our own intellectual
property portfolio comprises a 20-year patent pending (in certain remaining jurisdictions) solid-form compound, the AZD1656
Cocrystal (a HK-4 Glucokinase Activator), targeting a wide range of autoimmune diseases. Our pipeline research includes a number of
compounds that serve as promising alternatives to existing clinical assets currently marketed and sold by large pharmaceutical
companies, which we have identified as having an opportunity to develop further intellectual property positions through solid-form
technology. 

In
connection with the funding and development of clinical assets, we evaluate and select the specific molecules to be developed and collaborate
with external contract research organizations CROs and Key Opinion Leaders KOLs to run clinical trials that are managed, funded, and overseen by us. We intend to leverage our comprehensive
clinical and scientific expertise in order to facilitate development of clinical assets through Phase II trials in an efficient manner
by using CROs and third-party service providers. We will also collaborate closely with disease specific KOLs to collectively assess and
determine the most appropriate indications for all our current and forthcoming assets. 

We
believe that successful Phase II trials of the clinical assets in our pipeline will increase the value of our assets. There is no assurance
that any clinical trials on the assets owned or licensed by us will be successful, however, following a successful Phase II clinical
trial, we would look to licensing opportunities with large biotech or pharmaceutical companies, typically for up-front milestone payments
and royalty income streams for the life of the asset patent. We anticipate using any future royalty income stream to develop our asset
portfolio in combination with other potential sources of financing, including debt or equity financing. 

Outside
of our proprietary owned patented clinical assets, AstraZeneca AB (PUBL) AstraZeneca agreed to grant a license to
the Company under certain intellectual property rights controlled by AstraZeneca related to HK-4 Glucokinase activators AZD1656 and
AZD5658 in all indications and myeloperoxidase inhibitor AZD5904 for the treatment, prevention, and prophylaxis of idiopathic male
infertility. The Company will be responsible for the development and commercialization of the relevant products licensed under the
related License Agreement (the Licensed Products ). The Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to
develop and commercialize the Licensed Products. 

23 

AstraZeneca
has conducted initial pre-clinical and, in some instances, clinical trials on these assets, but has decided to license them for further
development. 

As
the clinical assets have undergone initial pre-clinical and clinical testing conducted by AstraZeneca, we are able to use the safety
data generated in these clinical trials to assess which clinical assets to further develop and for which indications. 

Through
this relationship, there are considerable active pharmaceutical ingredients APIs that were manufactured by AstraZeneca in conducting its clinical trials available. As
a result, Conduit may not have to develop the APIs, which is often a time consuming and expensive process, and the APIs already produced
were subject to rigorous quality control measures. 

Furthermore,
Conduit is well positioned to pursue, and intends, to pursue additional relationships and/or partnerships with third parties for the
licensing of further assets which are currently deprioritized. We plan to focus our efforts on developing clinical assets to address
diseases that impact a large population where there is no present treatment or the present treatment, carries significant unwanted
side effects. 

Key
Component of Result of Operations 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the research and development of our candidates and programs.
We expense research and development costs and intangible assets acquired that have no alternative future use as incurred. These expenses
include: 

personnel-related
 expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

expenses
 incurred in connection with the clinical development and regulatory approval of our clinical assets, including under agreements with
 third parties, such as consultants, contractors and CROs; 

license
 fees with no alternative use; and 

other
 expenses related to research and development. 

We
expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future
for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the benefits are
consumed. 

We
incurred approximately 25,000 and 153,000 on research and development activities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively.
There was no comparable research and development funding during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. Our research and development
activities have been wholly focused on developing co-crystals of AZD1656 to increase patent life. Some of this work was completed by
third-party CROs but all intellectual property is retained by us. We currently have one pending international patent application and
two pending national patent applications. The successful completion of clinical trials increases the value of clinical assets and may
lead to the commercialization and/or licensing of such assets to other pharmaceutical companies. There is no assurance that any clinical
trials on the assets owned or licensed by us will be successful. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist of salaries and other related costs, legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters,
professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance costs, travel, and other operating costs. 

24 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we increase our administrative
headcount to operate as a public company and as we advance clinical assets through clinical development. We also will incur additional
expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the
SEC and the Nasdaq listing rules, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional
services. In addition, if regulatory approval is obtained for clinical assets, we expect to incur expenses associated with building a
sales and marketing team. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

Other
income (expenses), net 

Other
income (expense), net consists of change in the fair value of options, change in fair value of convertible notes, and expense incurred
upon the issuance of warrants during the quarter. Other income (expense), net consists of change in the fair value of options, change
in fair value of convertible notes, and expense incurred upon the issuance of warrants during the quarter. 

Interest
expense, net 

Interest
expense, net consists primarily of interest expense on convertible loan notes and promissory notes and interest expense on deferred commissions
payable to an advisor for fees related to the Merger, as well as a small amount of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held
by the Company.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Management
assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. Since our inception,
and in line with our growth strategy, we have prepared our financial statements assuming we will continue as a going concern. Since our
inception, we have incurred net losses and experienced negative cash flows from operations. To date, our primary sources of capital have
been through private placements of equity securities and convertible debt as well as PIPE financing as a result of the Merger. During
the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net losses of 8.9 million and 3.4 million, respectively. We
expect to incur additional losses and higher operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development
programs. We have determined that additional financing will be required to fund our operations for the next 12 months and our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional capital and financing. 

Sources
and Uses of Liquidity 

Our
primary uses of cash are to fund our operations as we continue to develop our product candidates. We will require a significant amount of cash for
expenditures as we invest in ongoing research and development and business operations. Until such time as we can generate significant
revenue from commercialization or licensing, we expect to finance our cash needs for ongoing research and development and business
operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other capital sources, including strategic partnerships. However, we
may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements, when needed, on favorable terms or at all. To the extent
that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders
will be, or could be, diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the
rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, or substantially
reduce research and development efforts. While the Company believes in the viability of its ability to raise additional funds, there
can be no assurances to that effect. 

27 

Cash
Requirements 

Our
material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. 

Promissory
Convertible Note 

In
March 2023, we issued an aggregate principal amount of 0.8 million convertible promissory note payable to an investor. 

The
promissory convertible note matures and is payable in full, 18 months from the date of the note. The note carries 20 interest and
is payable every six months from the date of the note until the maturity date. The notes became convertible into shares
Conduit s common stock following the consummation of the Merger. 

Loans
Payable 

In
May 2022, we entered into two loan agreements, with an aggregate principal amount of 0.2 million, with two lenders. 

The
loans payable mature and is payable in full two years from the date of the agreement and bear no interest. 

For
additional information regarding our convertible promissory note, see Note 7 of the note to the unaudited financial statements. 

Working
Capital 

We
currently anticipate that cash required for working capital for the next 12 months is approximately 17.1 million, which includes deferred
financing fees payable of 5.7 million, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 1.7 million, a convertible promissory note,
if not converted prior to maturity, of 0.8 million, and a note payable of 0.2 million that matures
within the next 12 months. We do not anticipate being able to fund required capital expenditures for the next 12 months with cash and
cash equivalents on hand as we have a history of limited cash on hand. We have historically been able to access funds through the issuance
of our convertible notes and believe we can continue to obtain funding through debt and equity financing agreements as needed to meet
cash requirements for the next 12 months.

Cash
Flows Used in Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was 3.9 million, resulting primarily from a net loss of
 8.9 million and a change in the fair value of warrants of 0.1 million, adjusted for non-cash items including 0.9 million of
stock-based compensation, 0.9 million of amortization expense, 2.7 million expense on the issuance of warrants, 0.2 million
interest expense of the deferred commission payable, 0.2 million non-cash share issuance and a 0.4 million cash inflow from
operating assets and liabilities. The 0.4 million cash inflow from operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a 0.8
million cash inflow from accounts payable, partially offset by a 0.1 million cash outflow from accrued expenses and other current
liabilities and a 0.3 million cash outflow from prepaid expenses. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was 2.4 million, resulting primarily from a net loss of 3.8
million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 0.3 million for a loss on the change in fair value of convertible notes payable, a 0.3 million
loss change in reserve on a related party loan, and a 0.6 million loss on the change in fair value of the Cizzle option. The 0.1 million
cash inflow from operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to a 1.0 million cash inflow from accrued expense and other current
liabilities due to differences in the timing of disbursements and a 0.9 million cash outflow from prepaid expenses. 

Cash
Flows (Used) Provided by Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, resulted from net purchases of short
term investments of 0.2 million and purchases of PP E during the year. 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was 0.3 million, resulting from the issuance of a loan to
a related party of 0.03 million and proceeds on issuance of an option of 0.5 million. 

Cash
Flows Provided by Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was 0.1 million, resulting from the proceeds on the issuance
of the April 2024 warrants. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was 2.7 million, resulting from the issuance of a convertible
note payable of 1.4 million and 0.7 million from the issuance of a convertible promissory note
payable.

Contractual
Obligations and Other Commitments 

As
of June 30, 2024, we had no non-cancellable commitments for the purchase of clinical materials, contract manufacturing, maintenance and
committed funding which we expect to pay within one year. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing
basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant
estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported
financial results include the following: 

Fair
Value Measurements 

ASC
Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received
for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants. In determining fair value, the Company used various valuation approaches. A fair
value hierarchy has been established for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes
the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. 

Unobservable
inputs reflect the Company s assumption about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed
based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels, based on the
inputs, as follows: 

Level
 1-Valuations based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that
 are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

30 

Level
 2- Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for either similar instruments
 in active markets, identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant
 value drivers are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level
 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable. These valuations require significant judgment. 

The
Company s Level 1 assets consist of cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying balance sheets and the value of accrued expenses
and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. 

Warrants 

The Company determines the accounting
classification of warrants as either liability or equity by first assessing whether the warrants meet liability classification in accordance
with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). Under ASC 480, a financial instrument that embodies an unconditional
obligation, or a financial instrument other than an outstanding share that embodies a conditional obligation, that the issuer must or
may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares must be classified as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) if,
at inception, the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on any one of the following: (a) a fixed monetary
amount known at inception; (b) variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares; or (c) variations
inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares. If financial instruments, such as the warrants, are
not required to be classified as liabilities under ASC 480, the Company assesses whether such instruments are indexed to the Company s
own stock under ASC 815-40. In order for an instrument to be considered indexed to an entity s own stock, its settlement amount
must always equal the difference between the following: (a) the fair value of a fixed number of the Company s equity shares, and
(b) a fixed monetary amount or a fixed amount of a debt instrument issued by the Company. 

Equity classified warrants are
recorded in stockholders deficit and liability classified warrants are recorded as liabilities within the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The liability classified warrants are remeasured each period with changes recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
and Comprehensive Loss. 

As of June 30, 2024, the Company
had outstanding warrants that are classified as a liability within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the warrant
liability is determined each balance sheet date based on Level 2 inputs as such inputs are based on observable inputs other than quoted
prices. The warrant liability is valued using a Black-Scholes model, with the most judgmental non-observable input being the volatility
measure. Changes in the assumptions around the volatility can cause significant changes in the estimated fair value of the warrant liability.
See Note 4 for further information on the Company s financial liabilities carried at fair value. 

During the sixth months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued warrants that met the criteria to be classified within
stockholders deficit within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the warrants was determined by using a
Black-Scholes model, with the most judgmental non-observable input being the volatility measure. Changes in the assumptions around the
volatility could have caused significant changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants. See Note 14 for further information on the
warrants classified within stockholders deficit. 

Share Based Compensation 

The Company accounts for share based compensation arrangements granted
to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation: Stock Compensation, by measuring the grant date fair value
of the award and recognizing the resulting expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange
for the award. The grant date fair value of stock options is determined using a Black-Scholes model, with the most judgmental non-observable
input being the volatility measure. Changes in the assumptions around the volatility can cause significant changes in the grant date fair
value of stock options. The Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

The
Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). Under
the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of
the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period
for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the
earlier of the date that: (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended
transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with
the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

Upon
closing of the Merger, the surviving company remained an emerging growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act until the earliest of
(i) the last day of the combined entity s first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of MURF s
initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which the combined entity has total annual gross revenue of at
least 1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which the combined entity is deemed to be a large accelerated filer,
which means the market value of the combined entity s common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of
the prior December 31st or (iv) the date on which the combined entity has issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt
securities during the prior three year period. 

31 

In
addition, Conduit is a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. The Company may continue to be a smaller reporting company
even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller
reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as (i) Conduit s voting and non-voting
common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii)
Conduit s annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and its voting and non-voting
common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of its second fiscal quarter. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure regarding quantitative and qualitative market risk. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 and for the comparison
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to material weaknesses previously identified and not yet remediated as of
the end of both such periods. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes to in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter. 

On May 15, 2024, Adam Sragovicz s resignation as Chief Financial Officer of the Company became effective. Mr. Sragovicz s
resignation was not due to any disagreement with management or the Company s operations, policies or practices. Effective May 15,
2024 the Board appointed James Bligh, Senior Vice President Strategy, as Interim Chief Financial Officer (and principal financial
officer).

such proceeding, we are not currently party to or aware of being subject to any other material legal proceedings. However, we may
from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation could
impact our business due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Notice
of Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule 

On
August 12, 2024, Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the Company received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications
Department (the Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq notifying the Company that for the last 30 consecutive
business days the closing bid price for the Company s common stock had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for
continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the Bid Price Rule ). The deficiency
letter does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company s common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market. 

In
accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) (the Compliance Period Rule ), the Company has been provided an initial
period of 180 calendar days, or until February 10, 2025 (the Compliance Date ), to regain compliance with the Bid Price
Rule. If, at any time before the Compliance Date, the closing bid price for the Company s common stock closes at 1.00 or more
for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days as required under the Compliance Period Rule, the Staff will provide written notification
to the Company that it complies with the Bid Price Rule, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend this 10 day period pursuant
to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(H). 

If
the Company does not regain compliance by February 10, 2025, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period
if it applies to transfer the listing of its common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market. To qualify, the Company would be required to
meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of its publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the
Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement, and provide written notice of its intention to cure the
minimum bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. If the Nasdaq staff determines that the Company will not be able to
cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible for such additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that
the Company s common stock will be subject to delisting. The Company would have the right to appeal a determination to delist its
common stock, and the common stock would remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Market until the appeal process is complete. There can be
no assurance that, if the Company does appeal the delisting determination by the Staff to the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel, that
such appeal would be successful. 

The
Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance
with the Bid Price Rule, which could include effecting a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will
be able to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule.
