Forward-Looking
Statements 

Certain
statements that we make from time to time, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. These statements relate to anticipated future events, future results
of operations or future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, 
 might, will, shall, should, could, intends, expects, 
 plans, goals, projects, anticipates, believes, seeks, 
 estimates, forecasts, predicts, possible, potential, target, 
or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Our operations involve risks and uncertainties,
many of which are outside of our control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could materially affect our results of operations
and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q include, without limitation, statements reflecting management s expectations for future financial performance and operating
expenditures (including our ability to continue as a going concern, to raise additional capital and to succeed in our future operations),
expected growth, profitability and business outlook, increased sales and marketing expenses, and the expected results from the integration
of our acquisitions. 

Forward-looking
statements are only predictions, are uncertain and involve substantial known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that
may cause our (or our industry s) actual results, levels of activity or performance to be materially different from any future
results, levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other
things, the unknown risks and uncertainties that we believe could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements
as set forth under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. New
risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of the risks and uncertainties that could
have an impact on the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, risks and uncertainties relating to: 

our
 ability to manage our growth, including acquiring, partnering with, and effectively integrating
 acquired businesses into our infrastructure and avoiding legal exposure and liabilities associated
 with acquired companies and assets; 

our
 ability to retain our clients and revenue levels, including effectively migrating new clients
 and maintaining or growing the revenue levels of our new and existing clients; 

our
 ability to maintain operations in Pakistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Sri Lanka (together,
 the Offshore Offices in a manner that continues to enable us to offer competitively
 priced products and services; 

our
 ability to keep pace with a rapidly changing healthcare industry; 

our
 ability to consistently achieve and maintain compliance with a myriad of federal, state,
 foreign, local, payor and industry requirements, regulations, rules, laws and contracts; 

our
 ability to maintain and protect the privacy of confidential and protected Company, client
 and patient information; 

our
 ability to develop new technologies, upgrade and adapt legacy and acquired technologies to
 work with evolving industry standards and third-party software platforms and technologies,
 and protect and enforce all of these and other intellectual property rights; 

our
 ability to attract and retain key officers and employees, and the continued involvement of
 Mahmud Haq as Executive Chairman and A. Hadi Chaudhry as Chief Executive Officer, all of
 which are critical to our ongoing operations and growing our business; 

our
 ability to realize the expected cost savings and benefits from our restructuring activities
 and structural cost reductions; 

our
 ability to comply with covenants contained in our credit agreement with our senior secured
 lender, Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First Citizens Bank, and other future debt facilities; 

our
 ability to resume and then continue to pay our monthly dividends to the holders of our Series
 A and Series B preferred stock; 

our
 ability to incorporate AI into our products faster and more successfully than our competitors,
 protecting the privacy of medical records and cybersecurity threats; 

our
 ability to compete with other companies developing products and selling services competitive
 with ours, and who may have greater resources and name recognition than we have; 

2 

our
 ability to effectively integrate, manage and keep our information systems secure and operational
 in the event of a cyber-attack; 

our
 ability to respond to the uncertainty resulting from pandemics, epidemics or other public
 health emergencies and the impact they may have on our operations, the demand for our services,
 our projected results of operations, financial performance or other financial metrics or
 any of the foregoing risks and economic activity in general; 

our
 ability to keep and increase market acceptance of our products and services; 

changes
 in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; and 

other
 factors disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or our other filings with the Securities
 and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

The
forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on our current expectations, beliefs and views as
of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q concerning future developments and their potential effects on our business. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are reasonable,
we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments
may cause our assessments to change. Except as required by law, we are under no duty to update or revise any of such forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

You
should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance
and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we currently expect. The forward-looking statements contained herein
should not be relied upon as representing our assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

AS
OF AND FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

AND
2023 (UNAUDITED) 

Liquidity
and Going Concern Primarily due to a decline in revenue associated with our Healthcare IT segment and a goodwill impairment
of million for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company generated a net loss of million and had a net decrease in cash
of million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, the Company had negative working capital of 
and cash of million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net income of million and 
million, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the Company had positive working capital of and cash of million. Absent any
other action as of December 31, 2023, the Company may have required additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next 12
months. 

However,
management has considered its plans to continue the Company as a going concern and believes substantial doubt was alleviated by focusing
on cost-control. As discussed in Note 9, the Company approved a restructuring plan to reduce headcount and operating costs and generate
positive cash flow. In addition, in December 2023, the Company suspended the dividend on the Company s Preferred Stock, which saved
approximately million of cash each month through September 11, 2024 and saves approximately million thereafter. The dividend
will continue to accumulate in arrears each month since it is cumulative, but would not be a legal obligation until the dividend is reinstated.
The dividend will not be recorded as a liability until it is declared by the Board of Directors. The Company projects that this restructuring
plan, which was implemented in 2023 and will be completed by the end of 2024, will reduce expenses, thereby reducing ongoing liquidity
needs to enable continuation of operations and compliance with the debt covenants for the foreseeable future. Although there are no guarantees
that the Company will be successful, it believes such initiatives will enable it to continue as a going concern through at least the
next twelve months. 

Significant
Accounting Policies During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes to the Company s significant
accounting policies from its disclosures in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on
March 21, 2024. 

and a corresponding
increase to the allowance for expected credit losses. 

In
March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements Issue 2. The amendments in this
update require that leasehold improvements associated with common control leases be: (1) amortized by the lessee over the useful life
of the leasehold improvements to the common control group as long as the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset through a lease
and (2) accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity if, and when, the lessee no
longer controls the use of the underlying asset. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2023. There was no impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements as a result of this standard. 

In
October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC s Disclosure
Update and Simplification Initiative. This update amends the disclosure or presentation requirements related to various subtopics
in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification ). The new guidance is intended to align U.S. GAAP requirements

The
Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence
of events indicates that potential impairment exists. As a result of a triggering event in December 2023 resulting from the decreased
equity market value following the suspension of the Preferred Stock dividend, the Company updated its annual goodwill impairment test
that was performed as of October 31, 2023 for the Healthcare IT segment. It was determined that the fair value of the Healthcare IT reporting
unit was less than the carrying value at both October 31 and as of the date of the triggering event. Accordingly, impairment charges
of approximately million were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023. The conclusion was based upon the value determined using
the discounted cash flow method as supported by the guideline company transaction method and the guideline public company method. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined that there was no further impact on the valuation of goodwill.

of these dividends deferred approximately million in cash dividend payments each month. Due to the above Amendment, effective on

Revenue 

Technology-enabled
business solutions: 

Revenue
derived on an on-going basis from our technology-enabled solutions, which typically include revenue cycle management services, is billed
as a percentage of payments collected by our customers. The fee for our services often includes the ability to use our electronic health
records EHR and practice management software as well as revenue cycle management RCM as part of the bundled
fee. The Software-as-a-Service SaaS component is not a material portion of the contract compared to the stand-alone value
of RCM. 

Technology-assisted
revenue cycle management services are the recurring process of submitting and following up on claims with health insurance companies
in order for the healthcare providers to receive payment for the services they rendered. The Company typically invoices customers on
a monthly basis based on the actual collections received by its customers and the agreed-upon rate in the sales contract. The fee for
these services typically includes use of practice management software and related tools (on a SaaS basis), electronic health records
(on a SaaS basis), medical billing services and use of mobile health solutions. We consider the services to be one performance obligation
since the promises are not distinct in the context of the contract. The performance obligation consists of a series of distinct services
that are substantially the same and have the same periodic pattern of transfer to our customers. 

In
many cases, our clients may terminate their agreements with 90 days notice without cause, thereby limiting the term in which we
have enforceable rights and obligations, although this time period can vary between clients. Our payment terms are normally net 30 days.
Although our contracts typically have stated terms of one or more years, under ASC 606 our contracts are considered month-to-month and
accordingly, there is no financing component. 

For
the majority of our revenue cycle management contracts, the total transaction price is variable because our obligation is to process
an unknown quantity of claims, as and when requested by our customers over the contract period. When a contract includes variable consideration,
we evaluate the estimate of the variable consideration to determine whether the estimate needs to be constrained; therefore, we include
variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of cumulative
revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Estimates to
determine variable consideration such as payment-to-charge ratios, effective billing rates, and the estimated contractual payment periods
are updated at each reporting date. Revenue is recognized over the performance period using the input method. 

Our
proprietary, cloud-based practice management application automates the labor-intensive workflow of a medical office in a unified and
streamlined SaaS platform. The Company has a large number of clients who utilize the Company s practice management software, electronic
health records software, patient experience management solutions, business intelligence software and/or robotic process automation software
on a SaaS basis, but who do not utilize the Company s revenue cycle management services. SaaS fees may be fixed based on the number
of providers, or may be variable. 

Our
digital health services, which began generating revenue in 2022, include chronic care management, where a care manager has remote visits
with patients with one or more chronic conditions under the supervision of a physician who is our client. The performance obligation
for chronic care management is satisfied at a point in time once the patient receives the remote visit. The digital health services also
include remote patient monitoring where our system monitors recordings from FDA approved internet connected devices. These devices record
patient trends and alert the physician to changes which might trigger the need for additional follow-up visits. The performance obligations
for remote patient monitoring are satisfied over time as the recordings are received and the patient receives the remote visit. The revenue
for chronic care management for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was approximately and , respectively
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was approximately million and , respectively. The revenue for
remote patient monitoring for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was approximately and , respectively
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was approximately and , respectively. 

The
medical billing clearinghouse service takes claim information from customers, checks the claims for errors and sends this information
electronically to insurance companies. The Company invoices customers on a monthly basis based on the number of claims submitted and
the agreed-upon rate in the agreement. This service is provided to medical practices and providers to medical practices who are not revenue
cycle management customers. The performance obligation is satisfied once the relevant submissions are completed. 

Additional
services such as coding and transcription are rendered in connection with the delivery of revenue cycle management and related medical
services. The Company invoices customers monthly, based on the actual amount of services performed at the agreed-upon rate in the contract.
These services are only offered to revenue cycle management customers. These services do not represent a material right because the services
are optional to the customer and customers electing these services are charged the same price for those services as if they were on a
standalone basis. Each individual coding or transcription transaction processed represents a performance obligation, which is satisfied
over time as that individual service is rendered. 

Professional
services: 

Our
professional services include an extensive set of services including EHR vendor-agnostic optimization and activation, project management,
IT transformation consulting, process improvement, training, education and staffing for large healthcare organizations including health
systems and hospitals. The performance obligation is satisfied over time using the input method. The revenue is recorded on a monthly
basis as the professional services are rendered. Unbilled revenue at September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately and ,
respectively. 

Printing
and mailing services: 

The
Company provides printing and mailing services for both revenue cycle management customers and a non-revenue cycle management customer,
and invoices on a monthly basis based on the number of prints, the agreed-upon rate per print and the postage incurred. The performance
obligation is satisfied once the printing and mailing is completed. 

Group
purchasing services: 

The
Company provides group purchasing services which enable medical providers to purchase various vaccines directly from selected pharmaceutical
companies at a discounted price. Currently, there are approximately 4,000 medical providers who are members of the program. Revenue is
recognized as the vaccine shipments are made to the medical providers. Fees from the pharmaceutical companies are paid either quarterly
or annually and the Company adjusts its revenue accrual at the time of payment. The Company makes significant judgments regarding the
variable consideration which we expect to be entitled to for the group purchasing services which includes the anticipated shipments to
the members enrolled in the program, anticipated volumes of purchases made by the members, and the changes in the number of members.
The amounts recorded are constrained by estimates of decreases in shipments and loss of members to avoid a significant revenue reversal
in the subsequent period. The only performance obligation is to provide the pharmaceutical companies with the medical providers who want
to become members in order to purchase vaccines. The performance obligation is satisfied once the medical provider agrees to purchase
a specific quantity of vaccines and the medical provider s information is forwarded to the vaccine suppliers. The Company records
a contract asset for revenue earned and not paid as the ultimate payment is conditioned on achieving certain volume thresholds. 

For
all of the above revenue streams other than group purchasing services and chronic care management, revenue is recognized over time, which
is typically one month or less, which closely matches the point in time that the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits
provided by the Company. For the group purchasing services, revenue is recognized at a point in time. Each service is substantially the
same and has the same periodic pattern of transfer to the customer. Each of the services provided above is considered a separate performance
obligation. 

There
were no unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year. The Company has elected to
utilize the practical expedient available with the guidance for contracts with an expected duration of one year or less. 

Medical
practice management services: 

The
Company also provides medical practice management services under long-term management service agreements to three medical practices.
We provide the medical practices with the nurses, administrative support, facilities, supplies, equipment, marketing, RCM, accounting,
and other non-clinical services needed to efficiently operate their practices. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to
the medical practices. Revenue recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations represents the reimbursement of costs
paid by the Company for the practices and the management fee earned each month for managing the practice. The management fee is based
on either a fixed fee or a percentage of the net operating income. 

The
Company assumes all financial risk for the performance of the managed medical practices. Revenue is impacted by the amount of the costs
incurred by the practices and their operating income. The gross billing of the practices is impacted by billing rates, changes in current
procedural terminology code reimbursement and collection trends which in turn impacts the management fee that the Company is entitled
to. Billing rates are reviewed at least annually and adjusted based on current insurer reimbursement practices. The performance obligation
is satisfied as the management services are provided. 

Our
contracts for medical practice management services have approximately an additional 14 years remaining and are only cancellable under
very limited circumstances. The Company receives a management fee each month for managing the day-to-day business operations of each
medical group as a fixed fee or a percentage payment of the net operating income which is included in revenue in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations. 

Our
medical practice management services obligations consist of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the
same periodic pattern of transfer to our customers. Revenue is recognized over time, however for reporting and convenience purposes,
the management fee is computed at each month-end. 

Information
about contract balances: 

As
of September 30, 2024, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to the remaining revenue cycle management
performance obligations outstanding was approximately million. We expect to recognize substantially all of the revenue for the remaining
performance obligations over the next three months. Approximately and of the contract asset represents revenue earned,
not paid, from the group purchasing services and referral fees, respectively. 

Amounts
that we are entitled to collect under the applicable contract are recorded as accounts receivable. Invoicing is performed at the end
of each month when the services have been provided. The contract asset includes our right to payment for services already transferred
to a customer when the right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. For example, contracts for revenue
cycle management services where we recognize revenue over time but do not have a contractual right to payment until the customer receives
payment of their claim from the insurance provider. The contract asset also includes the revenue accrued, not received, for the group
purchasing services and referral fees earned.

in the contract asset are recorded as adjustments to net revenue. The changes primarily result from providing services to revenue cycle
management customers that result in additional consideration and are offset by our right to payment for services becoming unconditional
and changes in the revenue accrued for the group purchasing services. The contract asset for our group purchasing services is reduced
when we receive payments from vaccine manufacturers and is increased for revenue earned, not received. The opening and closing balances
of the Company s accounts receivable, contract asset and deferred revenue are as follows:

Deferred
commissions: 

Our
sales incentive plans include commissions payable to employees and third parties at the time of initial contract execution that are capitalized
as incremental costs to obtain a contract. The capitalized commissions are amortized over the period the related services are transferred.
As we do not offer commissions on contract renewals, we have determined the amortization period to be the estimated client life, which
is three years. Deferred commissions were approximately and at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included
in the other assets amounts in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of deferred sales commissions during the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately and , respectively, and approximately and 
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Trade
Accounts Receivable Estimate of Credit Losses: 

ASU
2016-13 requires the recognition of lifetime estimated credit losses expected to occur for trade accounts receivable. The guidance also
requires we pool assets with similar risk characteristics and consider current economic conditions when estimating losses. The adoption
of the ASU 2016-13 for trade accounts receivable was recorded as a charge to accumulated deficit of approximately as of January
1, 2023. 

At
adoption, we segmented the accounts receivable population into pools based on their risk assessment. Risks related to trade accounts
receivable are a customer s inability to pay or bankruptcy. Each pool was defined by their internal credit assessment and business
size. The pools are aligned with management s review of financial performance. For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, no adjustment to the pools was necessary. 

We
utilize a loss-rate method to measure the expected credit loss for each pool. The loss rate is calculated using a three-year lookback
period of write-offs and adjustments, divided by the revenue for each pool by aging category, net of customer payments during that period.
We consider current and future economic conditions, internal forecasts, customer collection experience and credit memos issued during
the current period when assessing loss rates. We reviewed these factors and concluded that no adjustments should be made to the historical
loss rate data for the current quarter. In addition, the Company uses specific account identification in determining the total allowance
for expected credit losses. Trade receivables are written off only after the Company has exhausted all collection efforts.

equity-based RSU agreements contain a provision in which the units shall immediately vest and become converted into common shares at
the rate of one share per RSU, immediately after a change in control, as defined in the award agreement.

In
February 2023, the Compensation Committee approved executive bonuses to be paid in shares of Series B Preferred Stock, with the number
of shares and the amount based on specified criteria being achieved during the year 2023. During October 2023, the Compensation Committee
approved the issuance of of the above shares to one of the executives who retired. The remaining shares were forfeited
in 2024. 

In
March 2024, the Compensation Committee approved executive bonuses to be paid in shares of Series B Preferred Stock with the number of
shares and the amount based on specified criteria being achieved during the year 2024. There were shares awarded. These criteria
will be evaluated in early 2025. During May 2024, an additional executive bonus with similar terms was approved and shares were
awarded. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, an expense of approximately and a net benefit of approximately
 , respectively, was recorded. The stock-based compensation benefit was primarily related to prior year bonuses that had been
accrued but were not awarded, net of current year bonuses that have been accrued. Stock compensation expense recorded is based on the
value of the shares at the grant date and recognized over the service period. The portion of the stock compensation expense to be used
for the payment of withholding and payroll taxes is included in accrued compensation in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The
balance of the stock compensation expense has been recorded as additional paid-in capital.

The
current income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily relates to state minimum taxes
and foreign income taxes. The deferred tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 relates to the book and tax
difference of amortization on indefinite-lived intangibles, primarily goodwill. To the extent allowable, prior to January 1, 2024, the
federal and state deferred tax provision had been offset by the indefinite life net operating loss. As a result of the goodwill impairment
charge recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023, deferred tax liability is currently required. 

The
Company has incurred cumulative losses, which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740.
Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded against the federal and state deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following is a discussion of our condensed consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, and other factors that are expected to affect our prospective financial condition. The following discussion
and analysis should be read together with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page 4 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024 . 

Some
of the statements set forth in this section are forward-looking statements relating to our future results of operations. Our actual results
may vary from the results anticipated by these statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements on page 2 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Financial
Risks 

The
Company maintains cash balances at Silicon Valley Bank SVB ), a division of First Citizens Bank Trust Company in
excess of the FDIC insurance coverage limits. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of this financial
institution to ensure its credit worthiness. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held cash of approximately 100,000
and 255,000, respectively, in the name of its subsidiaries at banks in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The banking systems in these countries
do not provide deposit insurance coverage. The Company has not experienced any losses on its cash accounts. 

During
December 2023, the Company suspended its Preferred Stock dividend and experienced a decline in its market capitalization as a result
of a sustained decrease in the Company s stock price for its common and preferred shares. This was considered a triggering event
and resulted in a goodwill impairment charge. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s stock price for its common and preferred
shares increased from their year-end values. Accordingly, the Company determined there was no impact on the valuation of goodwill. If
the stock prices were to decline, it could result in another triggering event that could impact the valuation of goodwill.

We
are able to deliver our industry-leading solutions at very competitive prices because we leverage a combination of our proprietary software,
which automates our workflows and increases efficiency, together with our team of approximately 330 experienced health industry experts
throughout the United States. These experts are supported by our highly educated and specialized offshore workforce of approximately
3,300 team members that are approximately 15 of the cost of comparably educated and skilled workers in the U.S. Our unique business
model also allowed us to become a leading consolidator in our industry sector, gaining us a reputation for acquiring and positively transforming
distressed competitors into profitable operations of CareCloud. 

Our
offshore operations in the Pakistan Offices and Sri Lanka together accounted for approximately 15 and 13 of total expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A significant portion of those foreign expenses were personnel-related costs
(approximately 75 and 77 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively). Because personnel-related costs are
significantly lower in Pakistan and Sri Lanka than in the U.S. and many other offshore locations, we believe our offshore operations
give us a competitive advantage over many industry participants. We are able to achieve significant cost reductions and leverage technology
to reduce manual work and strategically transition a portion of the remaining manual tasks to our highly-specialized, cost-efficient
team in the U.S., the Pakistan Offices and Sri Lanka. 

Key
Performance Measures 

We
consider numerous factors in assessing our performance. Key performance measures used by management, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted
operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, are non-GAAP financial measures,
which we believe better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period. 

These
non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Moreover, these non-GAAP
financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of our business as determined
in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP
basis, and we provide reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. Our
non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies
in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those
measures for comparative purposes. 

Adjusted
EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share provide an alternative
view of performance used by management and we believe that an investor s understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing
these adjusted performance measures. 

Adjusted
EBITDA excludes the following elements which are included in GAAP net income (loss): 

Income
 tax provision or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; 
 
 Interest
 expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on principal payments, on
 our debt; 
 
 Foreign
 currency gains and losses and other non-operating expenditures; 
 
 Stock-based
 compensation expense (benefit) includes cash-settled awards and the related taxes, based
 on changes in the stock price; 
 
 Depreciation
 and amortization charges; 
 
 Integration
 costs, such as severance amounts paid to employees from acquired businesses, and transaction
 costs, such as brokerage fees, pre-acquisition accounting costs and legal fees and exit costs
 related to contractual agreements; and 
 
 Loss on lease terminations, unoccupied lease charges and restructuring costs.

For
purposes of determining non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share, the Company used the number of common shares outstanding at the end of
September 30, 2024 and 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share was computed using an as-converted method and includes outstanding
unvested RSUs. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share does not take into account dividends
paid on preferred stock. No tax effect has been provided in computing non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share and non-GAAP adjusted diluted
earnings per share as the Company has sufficient carry forward net operating losses to offset the applicable income taxes.

Key
Metrics 

In
addition to the line items in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we regularly review the following metrics. We believe
information on these metrics is useful for investors to understand the underlying trends in our business. 

Providers
and Practices Served: As of both September 30, 2024 and 2023, we provided services to an estimated universe of approximately 40,000
providers (which we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills
for their services), representing approximately 2,600 independent medical practices and hospitals. In addition, we served approximately
150 clients who were not medical practices, but are service organizations who serve the healthcare community. The foregoing numbers include
clients leveraging any of our products or services and are based in part upon estimates in cases where the precise number of practices
or providers is unknown. 

Sources
of Revenue 

Revenue:
 We primarily derive our revenues from subscription-based technology-enabled business solutions, reported in our Healthcare IT segment,
which are typically billed as a percentage of payments collected by our customers. This fee includes technology-enabled RCM, as well
as the ability to use our EHR, practice management system and other software as part of the bundled fee. These solutions accounted for
approximately 63 and 64 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 66 and 65 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other healthcare IT services, including printing and mailing operations, group purchasing
and professional services, represented approximately 22 and 23 of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, and 21 and 23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

We
earned approximately 15 and 13 of our revenue from medical practice management services during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively, and approximately 13 and 12 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. This revenue
represents fees based on our actual costs plus a percentage of the operating profit and is reported in our Medical Practice Management
segment. 

Operating
Expenses 

Direct
Operating Costs. Direct operating cost consists primarily of salaries and benefits related to personnel who provide services to our
customers, claims processing costs, costs to operate the three managed practices, including facility lease costs, supplies, insurance
and other direct costs related to our services. Costs associated with the implementation of new customers are expensed as incurred. The
reported amounts of direct operating costs do not include depreciation and amortization, which are broken out separately in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations. 

Selling
and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, commissions, travel and advertising
expenses. 

General
and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative
employees, including compensation, benefits, travel, facility lease costs and insurance, software license fees and outside professional
fees. 

Research
and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs, software expense and third-party
contractor costs. 

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense is charged using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets ranging
from three to five years. Amortization expense is charged on either an accelerated or on a straight-line basis over a period of three
or four years for most intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions including those intangibles related to the group purchasing
services. Amortization expense related to the value of our medical practice management clients is amortized on a straight-line basis
over a period of twelve years. 

32 

Loss on Lease Terminations, Unoccupied Lease Charges and Restructuring Costs. Loss on lease terminations represents the write-off
of leasehold improvements and gains or losses as the result of lease terminations. Unoccupied lease charges represent the portion of
the lease and related costs for that portion of the space that is vacant and not being utilized by the Company. Two of the leases that
had unoccupied space ended in February 2023. Restructuring costs consists of severance and separation costs associated with the optimization
of the Company s operations and profitability improvements. 

Interest
and Other Income (Expense) - net. Interest income represents interest earned on temporary cash investments and late fees from customers.
Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our line of credit, term loans and the amortization of deferred financing
costs. Other income (expense) - net results primarily from foreign currency transaction gains/(losses). 

Income
Taxes. In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which
we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from
differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred losses historically and there is uncertainty regarding future
U.S. taxable income, which makes realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a
valuation allowance has been recorded against all deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements that we believe
affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements presented
in this Report are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the
Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Capitalized
Software Costs : 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amounts of internally-developed capitalized software in use was 13.7 million
and 17.1 million, respectively. The decrease was due to the current year amortization exceeding the amounts being capitalized. 

There
have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in the Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024.

Net
Revenue. Net revenue of 28.5 million and 82.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, decreased
by 734,000 or 3 and 6.0 million or 7 from net revenue of 29.3 million and 88.6 million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, respectively. Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes 17.9 million and 54.2 million relating
to technology-enabled business solutions, 4.9 million and 13.8 million related to professional services and 4.2 million and 11.0
million for medical practice management services, respectively. 

There
was an 800,000 and 4.0 million decrease in project-based professional services revenue for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year. The 2024 revenue was also negatively impacted by two large accounts that had
each been previously acquired prior to our beginning to serve them after a 2020 acquisition. The services provided to them were each
winding down at the time of our acquisition and they both transitioned to the systems of their acquirers during 2022. There was no revenue
from these two customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 700,000 for the same period in 2023. Revenue from
these customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 300,000 and 2.7 million, respectively, accounting for approximately
 2.4 million of the decline in revenue.

Direct
Operating Costs. Direct operating costs of 15.4 million and 45.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
respectively, decreased by 2.8 million or 16 and 8.0 million or 15 compared to direct operating costs of 18.3 million and 53.8
million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
salary costs decreased by 1.7 million and 5.1 million, outsourcing and processing costs decreased by 813,000 and 1.7 million and
billable expenses decreased by 400,000 and 1.1 million, respectively. The decrease in the salary costs was due to a decrease in the
U.S. and Pakistan headcount, lower revenue and the redeployment of employees performing functions that were previously classified as
direct operating costs to functions classified as research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Selling
and Marketing Expense. Selling and marketing expense of 1.4 million and 4.8 million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively, decreased by 962,000 or 41 and 2.7 million or 36 from selling and marketing expense of 2.3 million and 7.5
million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 was due to a reduction in headcount and lower spending on selling and marketing activities. 

General
and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense of 4.4 million and 12.1 million for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, respectively, decreased by 1.1 million or 20 and 4.4 million or 27 compared to general and administrative expense
of 5.5 million and 16.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, salary costs decreased by 823,000 and 3.0 million, respectively and legal and professional fees decreased
by 105,000 and 564,000, respectively. The decrease in salary costs was due to lower headcount. Also, there was a decrease in the Company s
contributions to community-based projects in Pakistan. 

Research
and Development Expense. Research and development expense of 800,000 and 2.8 million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively, decreased by 460,000 or 37 and 755,000 or 21 from research and development expense of 1.3 million and 3.5
million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
the Company capitalized approximately 4.4 million and 6.6 million, respectively, of development costs in connection with its internal-use
software. 

Depreciation
Expense. Depreciation expense of 504,000 and 1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
increased by 11,000 and 14,000 from depreciation of 493,000 and 1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively. 

35 

Amortization
Expense. Amortization expense of 2.7 million and 9.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
decreased by 673,000 or 20 and increased by 589,000 or 7 from amortization expense of 3.4 million and 8.8 million for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the placement
of additional internal-use software into production and beginning the related amortization. The decrease for the quarter was due to previously
acquired customer relationships becoming fully amortized. 

Loss on Lease Terminations, Unoccupied Lease Charges and Restructuring Costs. Loss on lease terminations represents the write-off
of leasehold improvements and gains or losses as the result of lease terminations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the
Miami office lease that we assumed in connection with an acquisition ended and we entered into a new lease arrangement with the landlord
for significantly less space. Charges of 2,000 and 73,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were
incurred as a result of vacating the former premises. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid
approximately 27,000 to settle a claim regarding a lease termination in India. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a facility lease
was terminated in conjunction with the Company ceasing its document storage services resulting in additional costs for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023, of approximately 1,000 and 162,000, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, there were 5,000 and 168,000 of unoccupied lease charges, respectively. There were 67,000 and 505,000 of restructuring
costs being recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, whereas in the same periods for 2023, there
were no restructuring costs. Restructuring costs consists of severance and separation costs associated with the optimization of the Company s
operations and profitability improvements. There were no losses on lease terminations or unoccupied lease charges during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024.

Interest
Income. Interest income of 17,000 and 68,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, decreased by
 35,000 and 56,000 from interest income of 52,000 and 124,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
The interest income represents late fees from customers and interest earned on temporary cash investments, which decreased due to less
funds being temporarily invested. 

Interest
Expense. Interest expense of 179,000 and 832,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, decreased
by 173,000 and increased by 3,000 from interest expense of 352,000 and 829,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, respectively. Interest expense on the line of credit was 624,000 and 618,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. 

Other
Income (Expense) net. Other income net was 60,000 and other expense net was 227,000 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to other expense net of 422,000 and 591,000 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Other expense or income primarily represents foreign currency transaction losses or gains.
These transaction losses or gains result from revaluing intercompany accounts which are denominated in U.S. dollars that represent amounts
payable/receivable between the entities. Whenever the exchange rate varies, the losses or gains are recorded in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations. 

Income
Tax Provision. The provision for income taxes was 41,000 and 119,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
compared to the provision for income taxes of 57,000 and 204,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
As a result of the Company having certain net operating losses with an indefinite life under the federal and state tax rules, the federal
and state deferred tax liability was offset against the net operating loss to the extent allowable in 2023. There were no deferred income
taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The
current income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 41,000 and 119,000, respectively,
which represents state minimum taxes and foreign income taxes. The Company has incurred cumulative losses historically and there is uncertainty
regarding future U.S. taxable income, which makes realization of a deferred tax losses difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740.
Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded against all deferred tax assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had total cash of 2.8 million and net working capital of 732,000. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, cash provided by operations was 15.4 million offset by cash used in investing and financing activities of 15.8 million resulting
in a decrease in cash of 549,000 after accounting for the effect of 140,000 of exchange rate changes. As of September 30, 2024, there
were no borrowings under the credit facility as the Company fully repaid the outstanding 10.0 million balance during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. 

In
fiscal year 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of 48.7 million compared to 5.4 million of net income in fiscal year 2022, and at
December 31, 2023, had cash of 3.3 million and a working capital deficit of 57,000. The decrease in cash for fiscal 2023 was 9.0 million
compared to an increase in cash of 2.0 million in fiscal 2022. The Company also had 10.0 million drawn on its line of credit. Together,
at December 31, 2023 these factors raised substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

However,
management has considered its plans to continue the Company as a going concern and believes substantial doubt was alleviated by focusing
on cost-control. Management developed a plan that was substantially implemented during fiscal 2023 to improve liquidity in its operations
through reductions in payroll and operating expenses. After the reductions are implemented and through employee attrition, the Company
expects an improvement of approximately 22.0 million in annualized cost savings, of which approximately 16.0 million will be realized
during 2024. The Company also suspended its Preferred Stock dividends in December 2023 resulting in cash savings of 1.3 million per
month through September 11, 2024 and approximately 1.1 million per month thereafter. Additional headcount reductions occurred in 2024
and further cost reductions will continue throughout the year. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s outstanding line of credit
was fully repaid. The Company continues to be focused on reducing costs, returning to profitability, generating positive cash flow and
maintaining compliance with its debt covenants. Although there are no guarantees that the Company will be successful, it believes that
such initiatives will enable it to continue as a going concern through at least the next twelve months. 

The
Company has begun realizing the effect of these plans and expects continued effects to be realized during the remainder of 2024 and beyond,
including further decrease in the Company s operating costs and an improvement in the Company s monthly cash flow from operations. 

Management
continues to focus on the Company s overall profitability, including managing expenses, and to the extent possible growing revenue,
and expects that these efforts will continue to enhance our liquidity and financial position. Based on management s forecasts,
the Company will have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they become due for the next twelve months from the date of the
financial statements issuance. 

Change
Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, experienced an incident on February 21, 2024, in which a cybersecurity threat actor gained
access to some of its information technology systems Change Healthcare Cybersecurity Incident ). The Company used Change
Healthcare to submit patient claims to Medicare and other payors for reimbursement. Since the time of the system disruption, the Company
found alternative processes to maintain overall operations. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company has not identified any compromise or unauthorized access of its systems or networks due to this
third party incident. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Company reconnected to many of the applications previously
maintained by Change Healthcare. The Company resumed claims submission to payors and utilized alternative platforms for its
claims. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not experience a material financial impact from the Change Healthcare Cybersecurity
Incident on the financial results as reported. The impact to the first quarter financial results was primarily related to decreased cash
flows from operations, which were recognized during the second and third quarters. The Company resumed submission of claims to payors
and determined that the Change Healthcare Cybersecurity Incident did not materially impact the Company, including its business operations,
financial condition or results of operations.

We
have not been adversely affected by inflation as typically we receive a percentage of the fees our clients collect from our revenue cycle
management services. Additionally, our medical practice management contracts are based on our costs plus a percentage of the medical
practice s operating income. We continue to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects through pricing strategies,
productivity improvements and cost reductions. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases
for fixed rate contracts to our customers, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts. The interest rate on
our line of credit is based on the prime rate which had been increasing through 2023 but has decreased slightly in 2024. 

The
Company has a revolving line of credit, and as of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the credit facility. During October
2024, the credit line was reduced to 10 million, which is the current unused borrowing base.

cash provided by operating activities was 15.4 million and 11.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

items: an increase in depreciation and amortization of 466,000 offset by a net decrease in stock-based compensation of 4.0 million.
Accounts receivable increased 388,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a decrease of 1.9 million for the

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments 

We
have contractual obligations under our line of credit. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. We also maintain
operating leases for property and certain office equipment. For additional information, see Contractual Obligations and Commitments under
Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, and 2023, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities
often referred to as structured finance or special-purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229.10(f)(1) and are not required to provide information under this item, pursuant
to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, based on the Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ), evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 as required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of
the Exchange Act. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. 

Based
on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. We will continue to improve
the controls to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files under the Exchange Act is reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and l5d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that
occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting other than a process improvement to our disclosure controls and procedures.

Part
II. Other Information 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

See
discussion of legal proceedings in Note 7, Commitments And Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in this Quarterly Report, which is incorporated by reference herein. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed
in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, which could
materially affect our business, financial condition and/or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are
not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial
may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and/or future results. 

We
Maintain Our Cash at Financial Institutions, Often in Balances That Exceed Federally Insured Limits. 

The
financial markets recently have encountered volatility associated with concerns about the balance sheets of banks, especially small and
regional banks who may have significant losses associated with investments that make it difficult to fund demands to withdraw deposits
and other liquidity needs. Although the federal government has announced measures to assist these banks and protect depositors, some
banks have already been impacted and others may be materially and adversely impacted. Our business is dependent on bank relationships
and we are proactively monitoring the financial health of such bank relationships. Continued strain on the banking system may adversely
impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Not
applicable. 

Item
3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

On
December 11, 2023, the Board of Directors suspended the monthly cash dividends for Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
beginning with the payment scheduled for December 15, 2023 together with the remaining dividends that were declared. The suspension of
these dividends deferred approximately 1.3 million in cash dividend payments each month. Effective in September 2024, due to a change
in the dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock, the monthly cash dividends were reduced to approximately 1.1 million per month.
As a result of such suspension, as of the filing date of this Quarterly Report, the Company has approximately 10.6 million of dividends
in arrears. During this suspension, dividends will continue to accumulate in arrears on the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. The
Board of Directors will regularly review and consider when the suspension should be lifted. See discussion of preferred stock dividend
suspension in Note 10, Shareholders Equity of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly
Report.
