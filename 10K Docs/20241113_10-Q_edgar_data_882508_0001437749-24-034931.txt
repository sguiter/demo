million, inclusive of a million advance from its Revolving Facility and million in net proceeds from the Company's sale of common stock in the nine months ended September 29, 2024 . The Company's restricted cash balance as of September 29, 2024 was million and relates to amounts pledged as cash security for the use of credit cards. 
 
 The Company was in compliance with all the Revolving Facility loan covenants as of September 29, 2024 . As of September 29, 2024 , the Company had million outstanding on the Revolving Facility with an interest rate of . 
 
 On March 13, 2024 , the Company entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain institutional investors and their affiliated entities for the sale of an aggregate of thousand shares of common stock, par value , in a registered direct offering, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million. Issuance costs related to the offering were negligible. The purchase price for each share of common stock was . See Note 9 for additional information. 
 
 On March 21, 2023 , the Company entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain investors for the sale of an aggregate of thousand shares of its common stock, in a registered direct offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S- 3, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million. Issuance costs related to the offering were immaterial. The purchase price for each share of common stock in the Share Placement was . 
 
 On April 28, 2023 , the Company converted accounts receivable for a customer in the amount of approximately million to notes receivable (the "Original Note"). At the time, the Original Note bore an interest rate of compounded monthly. On June 28, 2023 , the Company cancelled the Original Note and entered into a revised promissory note ("Second Revised Note") with the customer, where the interest rate changed to compounded monthly, or a effective annual interest rate, accruing from the date of the Original Note. On June 27, 2024 , the Company cancelled the Second Revised Note and entered into a revised promissory note ("Current Note") with the customer, where the interest rate changed to per annum. Accrued but unpaid interest will be compounded monthly, accruing from the date of the Current Note. Additionally, if not prepaid prior to the Current Note maturity date of the earlier of (i) months from June 28, 2024 or (ii) the closing of the customer's Series B financing, the principal and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable to the Company. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate will increase to . All other terms of the Note remained the same. As of September 29, 2024 , the related note receivable balance was million, including thousand in accrued interest. 
 
 The Company currently uses its cash to fund its working capital, to accelerate the development of next generation products, and for general corporate purposes. Based on past performance and current expectations, the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with million gross cash proceeds from the March 13, 2024 financing, its revenues from operations, and the available financial resources from the Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditures and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months. 

Various factors affect the Company s liquidity, including, among others: the level of revenue and gross profit as a result of the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry; the conversion of design opportunities into revenue; market acceptance of existing and new products including solutions based on the Company's ArcticLink and PolarPro platforms, ArcticPro , EOS S3 SoC, Quick AI solution, QuickAI , SensiML Analytics Toolkit, Eclipse II products, and eFPGA IP license and professional services; the timing, milestones, and payments related to our government contracts; fluctuations in revenue as a result of product end-of-life; fluctuations in revenue as a result of the stage in the product life cycle of its customers products; costs of securing access to and availability of adequate manufacturing capacity; levels of inventories; wafer purchase commitments; customer credit terms; the amount and timing of research and development expenditures; the timing of new product introductions; production volumes; product quality; sales and marketing efforts; the value and liquidity of its investment portfolio; changes in operating assets and liabilities; the ability to obtain or renew debt financing and to remain in compliance with the terms of existing credit facilities; the ability to raise funds from the sale of equity in the Company; the issuance and exercise of stock options and participation in the Company s employee stock purchase plan; and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economics. 
 
 Over the longer term, the Company anticipates that sales generated from its new product offerings, existing cash and cash equivalents, together with financial resources from its Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank, assuming renewal of the Revolving Facility or the Company entering into a new debt agreement with an alternative lender prior to the expiration of the revolving line of credit on December 31, 2025 , and its ability to raise additional capital in the public capital markets will be sufficient to satisfy its operations and capital expenditures. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to raise additional capital, if required, or that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. The inability of the Company to generate sufficient sales from its new product offerings and/or raise additional capital if needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operations and financial condition, including its ability to maintain compliance with its lender s financial covenants. 
 
 Principles of Consolidation 
 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of QuickLogic and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 Foreign Currency 
 
 The functional currency of the Company's non-U.S. operations is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current period-end exchange rates and non-monetary assets and related elements of expense are translated using historical exchange rates. Income and expense elements are translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses from the foreign currency transactions of these subsidiaries are recorded as interest income and other expense, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations, and are insignificant for all periods presented. 
 
 Uses of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of commitments and contingencies at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
 
 The methods, estimates, and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results it reports in its consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and requires it to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 
 Although these estimates are based on the Company s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and assumptions. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, inventory valuation, including the identification of excess quantities, market value, and obsolescence, and valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets. The Company believes that it applies judgments and estimates in a consistent manner and that such consistent application results in consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented. However, any factual errors or errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. For additional information, please refer to the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10 -K, which was filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024 . 
 
 Concentration of Risk 
 
 The Company's accounts receivable and note receivable are denominated in U.S. dollars and are derived primarily from sales to customers located in North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral. See Note 12, Information Concerning Product Lines, Geographic Information and Revenue Concentration, for information regarding concentrations associated with accounts receivable. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had million of revolving debt outstanding with Heritage Bank; the revolving debt carried an interest rate of per annum and per annum, respectively. Heritage Bank has a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company's tangible and intangible assets to secure any outstanding amounts under the agreement. The Company was in compliance with all loan covenants under the agreement as of the end of the current reporting period. The maturity date for advances under the revolving debt agreement is December 31, 2025 . At September 29, 2024 , the Company had utilized a significant portion of the revolving debt, and as a result, it maintains a substantial amount of cash deposits with Heritage Bank. The concentration of cash with one financial institution poses certain risks. 

For instance, adverse developments affecting financial institutions, companies in the financial services industry, or the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance, could adversely impact the stability of Heritage Bank, leading to additional financial risks for the Company. 
 
 Any material decline in available funding or the Company's ability to access its cash, cash equivalents, and liquidity resources, inclusive of those at Heritage Bank, could adversely impact its ability to meet its operating expenses, financial and contractual obligations, or result in breaches of its contractual obligations. Any of these impacts could have material adverse impacts on the Company's operations and liquidity. 

million, instead of presented as payments of finance lease obligations. Proceeds from notes payable during the nine months ended October 1, 2023 were million, instead of increases in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities. Additionally, million was added to the depreciation and amortization adjustment for amortization of software tools financed through financing arrangements for the nine months ended October 1, 2023 . 
 
 Conforming the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended October 1, 2023 to the Company's reclassification at fiscal year 2023 year-end of certain assets from property and equipment to internal-use software resulted in the reclassification of investing cash outflows from capital expenditures to internal-use software in the amount of million. 
 
 Additionally, non-cash activities of million related to deferred charges were removed from the consolidated statement of cash flows. Purchases of assets with financing arrangements were million for the nine months ended October 1, 2023 . 
 
 The Company has determined the correction of these errors did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements, including net income and the balance of accumulated deficit as of and for the nine months ended October 1, 2023 . 

thousand and thousand shares of common stock, respectively, associated with equity awards and the estimated number of shares to be purchased under the current offering period of the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan were outstanding. These shares were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share, as they were considered anti-dilutive due to the net losses the Company experienced during this period. Warrants to purchase up to thousand shares that were issued in connection with the May 29, 2018 , stock offering were not included in the diluted loss per share calculation of the periods presented as they were also considered anti-dilutive due to the net loss the Company experienced during these periods. The warrants were exercisable through May 29, 2023 at a price of per share. The warrants expired unexercised on May 29, 2023 . 
 
 For the three months ended October 1, 2023, thousand shares of common stock associated with equity awards and the estimated number of shares to be purchased under the current offering period of the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan were outstanding. Of these, a thousand share equivalent was determined to be dilutive and included in the computation of diluted net income per share for the period. Estimated proceeds for the dilutive shares were determined to be thousand, which resulted in a reduction of dilutive shares by using the treasury stock method at an average market price of .

 Overview 
 
 QuickLogic Corporation was founded in 1988 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999. We provide innovative, programmable silicon and software platforms to enable our customers to develop custom hardware products in a fast time-to-market and cost-effective way. Specifically, we are a fabless semiconductor company with a variety of products: embedded FPGA ("eFPGA") intellectual property ("IP"), low power, multi-core semiconductor system-on-chips ("SoCs"), discrete FPGAs, and AI software. Our customers can use our eFPGA IP for hardware acceleration and pre-processing in their Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) products, our SoCs to run our customers' software and build their hardware around, and our discrete FPGAs to implement their custom functionality. The Analytics Toolkit from SensiML Corporation ("SensiML"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, provides an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning solution with accurate sensor algorithms using AI technology. The full range of platforms, software tools, and eFPGA IP enables the practical and efficient adoption of AI, voice, and sensor processing across Aerospace and Defense, Consumer/Industrial IoT, and Consumer Electronics markets. 
 
 Our new products include the following: eFPGA IP Licensing business and associated professional services, consisting of development and integration of eFPGA technology into custom semiconductor solutions and our silicon products consisting of EOS , QuickAI , ArcticLink III, PolarPro 3, PolarPro II, PolarPro, and Eclipse II products. In addition to delivering our own semiconductor solutions, our new products category includes our AI/ML Software Platform from our wholly-owned subsidiary company, SensiML, which includes Software as a Service (SaaS) subscriptions for development, per unit license fees when deployed in production, and proof-of-concept services, all of which are also included in the new products revenue category. Our mature products include primarily FPGA families named PASIC 3 and QuickRAM , as well as programming hardware and design software. We currently have a total of four patent applications pending. 
 
 For our IP and silicon platforms, we collaborate with multiple partners on co-marketing and/or co-selling initiatives. These partners could have primary business lines in semiconductor IP, Design Services, semiconductor foundry, semiconductor assembly and test, and others. For our AI/ML Software, SensiML collaborates with several microcontroller and sensor manufacturers to integrate the microcontroller and/or sensor manufacturers development kits with SensiML s Analytics Toolkit in order to showcase combined solutions for AI/ML applications. Currently, these collaborations include Infineon Technologies, On Semiconductor Corp., Microchip Technology Inc., Silicon Laboratories, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Arduino, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Raspberry Pi, and Nordic Semiconductor. 
 
 Our eFPGA IP is currently developed on 12nm, 16nm, 22nm, 28nm, 40nm, 65nm, 90nm, 130nm, and 250nm process nodes with a roadmap to more advanced nodes. The licensable IP is generated by our automated compiler tool called Australis , which enables our engineers to create an eFPGA IP for our licensees that they can then integrate into their SoC without significant involvement by QuickLogic. We believe this flow enables a scalable development and support model for QuickLogic. For our eFPGA strategy, we typically work with semiconductor manufacturing partners prior to this IP being licensed to a SoC company. 
 
 We have changed our manufacturing strategies to reduce the cost of our silicon solution platforms to enable their use in a range of unique products ranging from low to high volume. Our EOS S3, EOS S3AI, QuickAI, and ArcticLink III silicon platforms combine mixed signal physical functions and hard-wired logic alongside our field programmable logic. Our EOS S3, EOS S3AI, and ArcticLink III solution platforms are manufactured on process nodes where we can benefit from smaller die sizes and lower power consumption. We typically implement sophisticated logic blocks and mixed signal functions in hard-wired logic because it is very cost-effective and energy efficient. We use small form factor packages, which are less expensive to manufacture and include smaller pin counts. Reduced pin counts result in lower costs for our customers' printed circuit board space and routing. Furthermore, our SRAM reprogrammable silicon platforms can be programmed in-system by our customers, and therefore, we do not incur programming costs, lowering the overall cost of ownership to our customers. We expect to continue to invest in silicon solution platforms and manufacturing technologies that make us competitive for the variety of markets and applications that programmable logic serves.

In order to grow our revenue from its current level, we depend upon increased revenue from our new products, including existing new product platforms and platforms currently in development. We expect our business growth to be driven mainly by eFPGA IP and our silicon solutions, with additional contributions from SensiML AI Software. Therefore, our revenue growth needs to be strong enough to enable us to sustain profitability while we continue to invest in the development, sale, and marketing of our new solution platforms, IP, and software. 
 
 We market our programmable logic (FPGAs and eFPGA IP) solutions primarily to Defense Industrial Base contractors, U.S. Government entities, System OEMs, and fabless semiconductor companies. These customers may value one or more of our product categories. A solution can be based on our programmable technology, which enables customized designs, low power, flexibility, rapid time-to-market, longer time-in-market, and lower total cost of ownership. We are capable of providing complete solutions because of our investment in developing the low power IP and software required to implement specific functions, along with sensor software algorithms optimized for our architecture. In some cases, we develop the IPs and either software or firmware ourselves and, in other cases, we utilize third parties to develop the mixed signal physical layers, logic, and/or software. 
 
 We market our SoC and SensiML solutions to OEMs and ODMs offering differentiated Consumer/IoT products, to processor vendors wishing to expand their served available market, and to sensor manufacturers and sensor processing software companies wishing to expand their ecosystems. Our target markets for our SoC and SensiML products include Consumer/Industrial IoT and Consumer Electronics. 
 
 By using our silicon platforms, our IPs, our software, and our in-depth architecture knowledge, we can deliver energy efficient custom solutions that blend the benefits of traditional ASSPs with the flexibility, product proliferation, differentiation, and low total cost of ownership advantages of programmable logic. 
 
 We monetize our technology through hardware product sales and eFPGA IP licenses, with any necessary corresponding work delivered via professional engineering services, SensiML Analytics Toolkit subscriptions, and per unit royalties. We specialize in enhancing the user experience in leading edge IoT hardware products. For our customers, we enable hardware and sensor algorithmic differentiation quickly, cost-effectively, and at low power. For our partners, we expand their reach into new segments and new use cases, thereby expanding the served available market for their existing hardware products. 
 
 Our embedded FPGA technology gives ASIC and SoC developers the benefit of flexibility to make design changes post-manufacturing changes at very fast time-to-and time-in-market, while keeping power consumption low. Our multi-core sensor processing products such as ArcticLink 3 S1, ArcticLink 3 S2, EOS 3, EOS S3 LV, and EOS S3AI provide an extremely power-efficient approach for real-time multi-modal (vision, motion, voice, location, biometric, and environmental) sensor processing independently of the cloud. Our SensiML Analytics Toolkit is cutting-edge software that enables ultra-low power IoT endpoints that implement AI to transform raw sensor data into meaningful insight at the device itself. The toolkit also provides an end-to-end development platform spanning data collection, labeling, algorithm and firmware auto generation, and testing. 
 
 We recognize that our markets require a range of solutions, and we intend to work with market-leading companies to combine silicon solution platforms, packaging technology, FPGA User Tools, sensor software algorithms, software drivers and firmware, to meet the product proliferation, high bandwidth, time-to-market, time-in-market, and form factor requirements of our customers. We intend to continue to define and implement compelling solutions for our target customers and partners. 
 
 We believe our solutions are resonating with our target customers who value lower power consumption, platform design flexibility, rapid time-to-market, longer time-in-market, and low total cost of ownership available through the use of our solutions. 
 
 We sell our products through a network of sales managers in North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, we have international sales operations in Japan and the United Kingdom. Our sales personnel and independent sales representatives are responsible for sales and application support for a given region, focusing on major strategic accounts, and managing our channel sales partners such as distributors. 
 
 Customers typically order our products through our distributors. Currently, we have 11 active distributors in the United States and a network of 18 active distributors and sales representatives throughout Europe and Asia to support our international business. eFPGA IP customers and SensiML SaaS subscribers typically enter into licensing agreements directly with QuickLogic and SensiML, respectively. 
 
 We also have an Aerospace and Defense, industrial, and IoT product customer base that purchases our mature silicon products. We expect to continue to offer silicon hardware products to these customers, as well as new eFPGA IP for when these customers choose to implement their own silicon platform solution. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we generated total revenue of 4.3 million, an increase of 4 compared to the prior quarter, and a decrease of 36 compared to the same quarter last year. Our new product revenue in the third quarter was 3.5 million, an increase of 16 from the prior quarter and a decrease of 42 from the third quarter of 2023. Our mature product revenue was 0.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 31 compared to the prior quarter, and an increase of 29 compared to the third quarter of 2023. We expect our mature product revenue to continue to fluctuate over time. 
 
 We devote substantially all of our development, sales, and marketing efforts to our new eFPGA IP l icensing and professional services and SensiML initiatives. Overall, we reported a net loss of 2.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to a net loss of 1.6 million in the prior quarter and a net income of 1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, we had one operating lease with a remaining lease term of 2.67 years. The operating lease relates to our company headquarters in San Jose, CA.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The methodologies, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, inventory valuation, including the identification of excess quantities, market value, and obsolescence, and valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets. We believe that we apply judgments and estimates in a consistent manner and that such consistent application results in consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented. However, any factual errors or errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our financial statements. During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, there were no changes in our critical accounting policies from our disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024.

In the third quarter of 2024, gross profit decreased 2.7 million, or 53 , compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The net decrease in gross profit reflects a 36 decrease in revenues, combined with a 23 net increase in cost of revenue. Revenue decreased from the same quarter in the prior year due to the timing of Department of Defense contracts. The net increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to the increased activity commensurate with the professional services revenue contracts. Labor and increased depreciation expenses from capitalized tooling substantially comprised this increase, with slight offsets from decreased consulting and software expenses. 
 
 Our semiconductor products have historically had long product life cycles and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. However, as we continue to pursue opportunities in the mobile market and develop new solutions and products, our product life cycle will be shorter, and the risk of obsolescence will increase. In general, our standard manufacturing lead times are longer than the binding forecasts we receive from customers.

Interest expense relates primarily to our revolving line of credit facility and notes payable. Interest income and other income (expense), net, relates to net foreign exchange losses recorded, partially offset by interest earned in our money market accounts. Changes in interest expense are related to our revolving loan's interest rate variability. Interest expense for the third quarter of this year as compared to the same period in the prior year increased approximately 138 thousand, which was comprised of a 21 thousand increase in interest expense related to notes payable, a 119 thousand increase in interest expense and facility fees related to our revolving line of credit facility, and a 1 thousand decrease in interest expense related to IT hardware financing costs. Interest income and other income (expense), which is mostly comprised of bank fees, net foreign exchange losses, and refunds, remained essentially flat.

In the third quarter of 2024, gross profit decreased 0.2 million, or 3 , compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit reflects a 19 net increase in cost of revenue, partially offset by a 5 increase in revenues. Revenue increased from the same quarter in the prior year due to increases in SaaS IP revenues and revenue from devices and royalties. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to the increased activity commensurate with the professional services revenue contracts. Contract manufacturing and outside services related to revenue contracts with customers substantially comprised this increase.

Our semiconductor products have historically had long product life cycles and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. However, as we continue to pursue opportunities in the mobile market and develop new solutions and products, our product life cycle will be shorter, and the risk of obsolescence will increase. In general, our standard manufacturing lead times are longer than the binding forecasts we receive from customers.

Research and Development 
 
 Our R D expenses consist primarily of personnel, overhead and other costs associated with System on Chip (SoC) and software development, programmable logic design, AI and eFPGA development. R D expenses remained essentially flat in the nine months ending September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year, which was primarily due to continued allocations of R D resources to costs of revenues resulting from labor and tooling costs attributable to professional services revenue contracts with customers. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 
 Our selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, finance, administration, human resources, and general management. The 1.0 million increase in SG A expenses in the nine months ending September 29, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily attributable to increases in equity and compensation expenses.

Interest expense relates primarily to our revolving line of credit facility and notes payable. Interest income and other income (expense), net, relates to net foreign exchange losses recorded, partially offset by interest earned in our money market accounts. Changes in interest expense are related to our revolving loan's interest rate variability. Interest expense for the second quarter of this year as compared to the same period in the prior year increased approximately 139 thousand, which was comprised of an 28 thousand increase in interest expense related to notes payable, a 113 thousand increase in interest expense related to our revolving line of credit facility, and a 2 thousand decrease in interest expense related to IT hardware financing costs. The favorable change in interest income and other income (expense), net reflects accrued interest receivable related to note receivables with offsets related to slight increase in foreign exchange losses.

There was a slight increase in the income tax expense for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2023. The computed tax rate for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was (0.40 as compared to (0.13 for the nine months ended October 1, 2023. The difference between the estimated annual effective income expense of 0 and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 is primarily due to the Company's valuation allowance movement in each period presented. It is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the federal, state, and certain foreign deferred tax assets as of September 29, 2024. As such, the Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against all of its US and certain foreign net deferred tax assets as of September 29, 2024. The projected annual effective tax rate before certain discrete items as of the third quarter of 2024 is 0 , as compared to the projected annual effective tax rate of 2.67 for the same period in the prior year.

Balance Sheet Activities 
 
 Balance sheet amounts at September 29, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 resulted from typical and usual activities in the normal course of business. 
 
 Total assets increased by approximately 1.9 million, primarily due to the capitalization of 7.8 million in property, plant, and equipment and internal-use software assets and a 1.4 million increase in other current assets, partially offset by 2.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense, a 2.2 million reduction in cash and cash equivalents due to payment of trade payables, a 2.2 million reduction in accounts receivable and contract assets due to the billing and collection of outstanding receivables, and a 0.2 million reduction in inventory. 
 
 Liabilities decreased by approximately 2.1 million due to payment of trade payables of 1.8 million, accrued liabilities of 1.2 million, and debt and lease obligations of 1.1 million, as well as the recognition of deferred revenue of 0.6 million. This was partially offset by an increase of 2.6 million in notes payable due to the purchase of additional software assets through financing arrangements. Equity increased 4.0 million due to a 7.5 million increase in additional paid in capital arising from the sale of shares of common stock and recognition of stock-based compensation, partially offset by a 3.5 million net loss for the nine months ended September 29, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We have financed our operations and capital investments through public and private offerings of our common stock, financing arrangements, operating leases, borrowings under a revolving line of credit, and cash flows from operations. In addition to our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 22.4 million, as of September 29, 2024, other sources of liquidity included a 20.0 million drawn down from our revolving line of credit ("Revolving Facility") with Heritage Bank of Commerce Heritage Bank ), and 3.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock on March 13, 2024. Costs related to the offering were immaterial. Our restricted cash balance as of September 29, 2024 was 0.1 million and relates to amounts pledged as cash security for the use of credit cards. 
 
 On April 28, 2023, we converted accounts receivable for a customer in the amount of approximately 1.16 million to notes receivable (the "Original Note"). At the time, the Original Note bore an interest rate of 3.0 compounded monthly. On June 28, 2023, we cancelled the Original Note and entered into a revised promissory note ("Second Revised Note") with the customer, where the interest rate changed to 4.69 compounded monthly, or a 4.8 effective annual interest rate, accruing from the date of the Original Note. On June 27, 2024, we cancelled the Second Revised Note and entered into a revised promissory note ("Current Note") with the customer, where the interest rate changed to 10.0 per annum. Accrued but unpaid interest will be compounded monthly, accruing from the date of the Current Note. Additionally, if not prepaid prior to the Current Note maturity date of the earlier of (i) 24 months from June 28, 2024 or (ii) the closing of the customer's Series B financing, the principal and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable to us. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate will increase to 15.31 . All other terms of the Note remained the same. As of September 29, 2024, the related note receivable balance was 1.26 million, including 97 thousand in accrued interest. 
 
 On March 13, 2024, we entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain institutional investors and their affiliated entities for the sale of an aggregate of 223 thousand shares of common stock, par value 0.001, in a registered direct offering, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately 3.5 million. Issuance costs related to the offering were negligible. The purchase price for each share of common stock was 16.00. See Note 9 for additional information. 
 
 On March 21, 2023, we entered into common stock purchase agreements with certain investors for the sale of an aggregate of 450 thousand shares of common stock, in a registered direct offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately 2.3 million. Issuance costs related to the offering were immaterial. The purchase price for each share of common stock in the Share Placement was 5.14. 
 
 We were in compliance with all the Heritage Bank Revolving Facility loan covenants as of September 29, 2024. As of September 29, 2024, we had 20.0 million outstanding on the Revolving Facility with an interest rate of 8.50 . 
 
 We currently use our cash to fund our working capital, to accelerate the development of next-generation products, and for general corporate purposes. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with 3.5 million gross cash proceeds from the March 13, 2024 financing, our revenues from operations, and the available financial resources from the Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months. 
 
 Various factors affect our liquidity, including, among others: the level of revenue and gross profit as a result of the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry; the conversion of design opportunities into revenue; market acceptance of existing and new products including solutions based on our ArcticLink and PolarPro platforms, ArcticPro , EOS S3 SoC, Quick AI solution, QuickAI , SensiML Analytics Toolkit, Eclipse II products, and eFPGA IP license and professional services; the timing, milestones, and payments related to our government contracts; fluctuations in revenue as a result of product end-of-life; fluctuations in revenue as a result of the stage in the product life cycle of our customers products; costs of securing access to and availability of adequate manufacturing capacity; levels of inventories; wafer purchase commitments; customer credit terms; the amount and timing of research and development expenditures; the timing of new product introductions; production volumes; product quality; sales and marketing efforts; the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio; changes in operating assets and liabilities; the ability to obtain or renew debt financing and to remain in compliance with the terms of existing credit facilities; the ability to raise funds from the sale of equity in the company; the issuance and exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan; and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economics. 
 
 Over the longer term, we anticipate that sales generated from our new product offerings, existing cash and cash equivalents, together with financial resources from our Revolving Facility with Heritage Bank, assuming renewal of the Revolving Facility or us entering into a new debt agreement with an alternative lender prior to the expiration of the revolving line of credit in December 2025, and our ability to raise additional capital in the public capital markets will be sufficient to satisfy our operations and capital expenditures. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, if required, or that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us. The inability to generate sufficient sales from our new product offerings and/or raise additional capital if needed could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition, including our ability to maintain compliance with our lender s financial covenants. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024 , most of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were invested in a money market account at Heritage Bank. As of September 29, 2024 , our interest-bearing debt consisted of 3.1 million outstanding under notes payable and 20.0 million outstanding under our Revolving Facility. See Note 7, Debt Obligations, to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more details. 
 
 Cash balances held at our foreign subsidiarie s were approximately 0.1 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Earnings from our foreign subsidiaries are currently deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We do not expect such reinvestment to affect our liquidity and capital resources, and we continually evaluate our liquidity needs and ability to meet global cash requirements as a part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Factors that affect our global capital deployment strategy include anticipated cash flows, the ability to repatriate cash in a tax-efficient manner, funding requirements for operations and investment activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and capital market conditions.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Based on management's evaluation as of September 29, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Part II. Other Information 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024, which includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors at Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, which discussion is hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1A. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 
 None. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 Insider Trading Arrangements 
 
 For the three months ended September 29, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a - 1 (f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated a "Rule 10b5 - 1 trading arrangement" or "non-Rule 10b5 - 1 trading arrangement" (as those terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
