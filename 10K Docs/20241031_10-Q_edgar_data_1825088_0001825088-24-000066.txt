 Contingent Consideration from Previous Business Combinations 
 In connection with applicable business combinations, the Company records the fair value of contingent consideration as a liability as of the acquisition date as prescribed by the underlying agreement. The initial measurement of contingent consideration is based on projected cash flows such as revenues, homebuilding gross margin, overhead expenses and pre-tax income of the acquired business and is discounted to present value using the discounted cash flow method. The remaining estimated contingent consideration payments are subsequently remeasured to fair value as of each reporting date based on the estimated future earnings of the acquired entities and the re-assessment of risk-adjusted discount rates that reflect current market conditions. Maximum potential exposure for contingent consideration is not estimable based on the contractual terms of the contingent consideration agreements, which allow for a percentage payout based on a potentially unlimited range of pre-tax income amounts.

On or after August 15, 2025, the 2028 Notes are redeemable at specified rates equal to of the principal balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and periodically decrease to on August 15, 2027. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), the holders of the 2028 Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2028 Notes at a price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

 Credit Agreement 
 On June 6, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its existing revolving credit facility (as amended, the Credit Agreement ).

Certain of our subsidiaries guaranteed the Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement. The amendments also updated the Company s minimum tangible net worth covenant, which resulted in an increase to the base component of such covenant from million to million. The Credit Agreement includes an accordion feature that allows the aggregate commitments to increase to up to billion, subject to a borrowing base.

Interest under Term SOFR Rate Loans and Daily Simple SOFR Rate Loans also include an applicable rate margin determined based on the Company s net debt to capitalization ratio, equivalent to credit spreads of to . 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement was million and million, respectively.

 The fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, customer deposits and mortgage warehouse facilities, approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of the construction lines of credit approximates their carrying amounts since they are subject to short-term floating interest rates that reflect current market rates. Fair value measurements may also be utilized on a nonrecurring basis, such as for the accounting for acquisitions or the impairment of long-lived assets and inventory.

 The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the share buyback program will depend on a number of factors, including constraints specified in any Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. The share buyback program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares in any period and may be expanded, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. 
 The Company accounts for share repurchases of Class A common stock as treasury stock. Treasury stock is recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity based on the amount paid to repurchase shares, including associated costs. Treasury stock is not considered outstanding. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, under the share buyback program, the Company repurchased and shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million in shares remain available for purchase under the share buyback program. There were no shares repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2023.

 (1) For the diluted earnings per share calculation, million and million in preferred dividends associated with redeemable preferred stock that are assumed to be converted have been added back to the numerator for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 (2) Since the conversion price of the Company s redeemable preferred stock is based on an average of the closing price of Class A common stock for the 90 trading days immediately preceding the end of the current period, changes in the price of the Class A common stock may significantly affect the number of additional assumed common shares outstanding under the if-converted method for diluted EPS, while the number of redeemable preferred stock shares outstanding is unchanged. Stock-based compensation awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS in the event they are antidilutive. There were million and million common stock equivalent shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were common stock equivalent shares and million of common stock equivalent shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, respectively.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and related notes thereto. Unless the context otherwise requires, Dream Finders, DFH, the Company, we, our and us refer collectively to Dream Finders Homes, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Business Overview and Outlook 
 We design, build and sell homes in high-growth markets using our asset-light lot acquisition strategy. Our primary focus is on constructing and selling single-family homes across entry-level, first-time move-up, second-time move-up, and active adult markets. To fully serve our homebuyers and capture ancillary business opportunities, we have financial services operations that offer title insurance and mortgage banking solutions. 
 Although ticking down since earlier this year, mortgage rates and inflationary pressures remain elevated. In September, the Federal Reserve made its first cut to the Federal Funds Rate in 2024. Despite the easing of certain economic conditions, variability in demand for homes and affordability challenges persist. Our asset-light strategy positions us to remain agile in any market conditions, allowing us to strategically renegotiate lot option takedowns to align with our sales pace. 
 We continued to see the positive effects of our commitment to future growth, whether through organic efforts, acquisitions, or a combination of both, all while keeping an asset-light approach. This strategy is reflected in our homebuilding revenues and closings, which grew by 10 and 8 , respectively, when comparing the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Notably, our acquisition of Crescent Homes played a significant role in these improvements. We believe this success, coupled with our increased investments in our lot pipeline, inventories and construction starts, positions us well for the future. We remain optimistic and believe that the current environment will continue to support faster inventory turnover and reinforce our shift towards spec sales for the foreseeable future. Our strategy has also allowed us to continue to pursue opportunities that contribute to our long-term outlook, including acquiring Jet HomeLoans, discussed below. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 On July 1, 2024, we acquired the remaining equity interest in our mortgage joint venture Jet HomeLoans, which is consolidated on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as of that date. Jet HomeLoans continues to be included in the Company s Financial Services segment.

 Homebuilding Revenues. The increase in homebuilding revenues was primarily attributable to 1,889 home closings for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 91 homes, or 5 , from 1,798 home closings for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 223 home closings with an ASP of 554,231 were contributed by the Crescent Homes acquisition. The consolidated ASP of homes closed increased 3 when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding Crescent Homes, 42 of our closings were in the Midwest segment with an ASP of 589,087, which is higher relative to our other homebuilding segments. The increased use of sales incentives during the third quarter of 2024 had a partially offsetting impact on the increase in homebuilding revenues. 
 Homebuilding Cost of Sales and Homebuilding Gross Margin. The higher homebuilding cost of sales and homebuilding gross margin were primarily due to the increase in home closings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in homebuilding gross margin as a percentage of homebuilding revenues when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily attributable to higher land and financing costs, partially offset by direct cost reductions and, to a lesser extent, continued improvements in cycle times.

 Southeast. Our Southeast segment total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 293 million, a decrease of 78 million, or 21 , from 371 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decline in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in home closings of 236, or 29 , which was partially offset by a 6 increase in the ASP of homes closed from changes in the geographic mix of closings within the segment. The reduction in home closings in part stems from temporary delays in the timing of expected active communities opening for sales. There were also fewer closings under built-for-rent contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Homebuilding gross margin percentage was 19.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 60 bps, or 3 , when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in homebuilding gross margin percentage was mostly due to higher land and financing costs, partially offset by direct cost reductions and, to a lesser extent, cycle time improvements. 
 Mid-Atlantic. Our Mid-Atlantic segment total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 284 million, an increase of 120 million, or 73 , from 164 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in home closings of 215, or 55 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Crescent Homes contributed 124 million in homebuilding revenues and 223 home closings with an ASP of 554,231 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Excluding Crescent, Mid-Atlantic total revenues decreased by 2 when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, mostly due to slightly fewer home closings and homebuilding gross margin percentage was 17.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 120 bps, or 6 , when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in this homebuilding gross margin percentage was primarily a result of higher land and financing costs. 
 Midwest. Our Midwest segment total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 409 million, an increase of 50 million, or 14 , from 359 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The additional revenue was due to higher home closings of 112, or 19 , partially offset by a decrease of 4 in the ASP of homes closed from changes in the geographic mix of closings within the segment. Homebuilding gross margin percentage was 18.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 370 bps, or 17 , from 21.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction in homebuilding gross margin percentage was due to an increase in land costs and, to a lesser extent, higher financing costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense. The increases in SG A and in SG A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues were primarily attributable to higher compensation costs of 12 million due to our growth from continued expansion, including the recent acquisition of Crescent Homes. Additionally, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, SG A also included 14 million of spend on forward commitment programs to allow our homebuyers to access lower interest rates on home loans at the point of sale, which was 5 million higher when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Contingent Consideration Revaluation. 2 million of the decrease in contingent consideration expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to lower fair value adjustments of future expected earnout payments related to the MHI acquisition, as actual results remained more in line with forecasts when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income Before Taxes Related to Homebuilding Operations. The decrease in income before taxes related to homebuilding operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the increase in SG A and decrease in homebuilding gross margin percentage explanations above.

 Homebuilding Rev enues. The higher homebuilding revenues were primarily attributable to 5,575 home closings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 414 homes, or 8 , from the 5,161 home closings for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The consolidated ASP of homes closed increased 2 when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 496 homes with an ASP of 506,079 were contributed by the Crescent Homes acquisition. Excluding Crescent Homes, 40 of our closings were in the Midwest segment with an ASP of 583,688, which is higher relative to our other homebuilding segments. 
 Homebuilding Cost of Sales and Homebuilding Gross Margin. The increased homebuilding cost of sales and homebuilding gross margin were primarily due to the increase in home closings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in homebuilding gross margin as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was primarily attributable to higher land and financing costs, partially offset by direct 
 cost reductions. Additionally, amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with home closings contributed from the Crescent Homes acquisition negatively impacted the nine months ended September 30, 2024 homebuilding gross margin percentage by approximately 21 bps. 
 Southeast. Our Southeast segment total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 914 million, a decrease of 137 million, or 13 , from 1,051 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decline in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in home closings of 423, or 19 , partially offset by a 7 increase in the ASP of homes closed. Homebuilding gross margin percentage was 19.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 130 bps, or 7 , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in homebuilding gross margin percentage was mostly the result of direct cost reductions and, to a lesser extent, cycle time improvements, partially offset by higher land and financing costs. 
 Mid-Atlantic. Our Mid-Atlantic segment total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 758 million, an increase of 311 million, or 70 , from 447 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in home closings of 560, or 49 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months September 30, 2023. Crescent Homes contributed 252 million in revenue and 496 home closings with an ASP of 506,079 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 Excluding Crescent, Mid-Atlantic total revenues increased by 13 when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to more home closings and, to a lesser degree, a higher ASP of 414,538, an increase of 28,424, or 7 , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Without Crescent, homebuilding gross margin percentage was 18.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 210 bps, or 13 , when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement in this homebuilding gross margin percentage was primarily a result of direct cost reductions and, to a lesser extent, cycle time improvements, partially offset by higher land and financing costs. 
 Midwest. Our Midwest segment total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,191 million, an increase of 86 million, or 8 , from 1,106 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to higher home closings of 277, or 16 , partially offset by a decrease of 6 in the ASP of homes closed. The decrease in ASP of homes closed was due to changes in the geographic mix of closings within the segment. Homebuilding gross margin percentage was 17.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 280 bps, or 14 , when compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction in homebuilding gross margin percentage was due to an increase in land costs and, to a lesser extent, higher financing costs, partially offset by direct cost reductions. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense. The increases in SG A and in SG A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues were primarily due to higher compensation costs of 41 million attributable to our growth, including the recent acquisition of Crescent Homes and our operational expansions in Florida and Arizona. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A included 30 million of spend on forward commitment programs to allow our homebuyers to access lower interest rates on home loans at the point of sale, which was 13 million higher when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Contingent Consideration Revaluation. 15 million of the decrease in contingent consideration expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to lower fair value adjustments of future expected earnout payments related to the MHI acquisition, as actual results remained more in line with forecasts when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income Before Taxes Related to Homebuilding Operations. The decrease in income before taxes related to homebuilding operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to the decrease in homebuilding gross margin percentage and the increase in SG A, partially offset by the decrease in contingent consideration explained above. 
 
 Land Acquisition and Development Process 
 We employ an asset-light and cost-effective lot acquisition strategy to achieve our growth goals. This strategy involves two key approaches: finished lot option contracts and land bank option contracts. These option contracts generally allow us, at our option, to forfeit our right to purchase the lots controlled for any reason, and our sole legal obligation and economic loss as a result of such forfeitures is limited to the amount of the deposits paid pursuant to such option contracts and in the case of land bank option contracts, our loss is limited to the related lot option fees paid to the land bank partner, and for certain land bank option contracts, any potential performance obligations, management of the land development to completion and any cost overruns relative to the project. We provide lot deposits typically averaging 10 of the land purchase price. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our lot deposits for finished lot option and land bank option contracts were 368 million and 247 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we controlled 44,825 and 29,748 lots, respectively, under finished lot option and land bank option contracts.

 (2) As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 8,481 owned lots, of which 5,884 were included in construction in process CIP and finished homes on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Of the 5,884 owned lots included in CIP and finished homes, 5,224 were under construction, 493 were completed spec homes and 167 were model homes. The remaining owned lots were purchased just-in-time to start construction through existing lot option contracts. 
 (3) As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 1,403 owned lots and 834 controlled lots under built-for-rent contracts (see Net Sales, Backlog and Closings for a definition of built-for-rent contracts). 
 (4) As of September 30, 2024, the Crescent Homes acquisition contributed 709 and 4,944 owned and controlled lots, respectively. 
 Our Active Communities 
 A community becomes active once the model is completed or the community has its fifth net new order. A community becomes inactive when it has fewer than five units remaining to sell. Active community count is an important metric to forecast future net new orders for our business. As of September 30, 2024, we had 235 active communities, an increase of 16 communities, or 7 , as compared to 219 active communities as of September 30, 2023. 
 Our active community count excludes communities under the Company's built-for-rent contracts, as all sales to third-party investors occur at one point in time and these communities would have no homesites remaining to sell. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 13 communities delivering closings under built-for-rent contracts, as compared to 20 communities as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Costs of Building Materials and Labor 
 Our cost of sales includes the acquisition and finance costs of homesites or lots, municipality fees, the costs associated with obtaining building permits, materials and labor to construct the home, interest costs for construction loans, internal and external realtor commissions and other miscellaneous closing costs. Homesite costs range from 20-30 of the average cost of a home. Building materials range from 35-45 of the average cost to build the home, labor ranges from 25-30 of the average cost to build the home, and interest, commissions and closing costs range from 5-10 of the average cost to build the home. 
 Our materials are subject to price fluctuations. Once construction of a home begins, prices for the materials utilized in the construction of that particular home are generally locked via purchase orders, but fluctuations may occur as a result of market conditions. Price fluctuations may be caused by several factors, including seasonal variation in availability of materials, labor and supply chain disruptions, trade disputes and changes in demand for materials as a result of the housing market conditions where we operate. The price changes that most significantly influence our operations are price increases in commodities or the cost of labor. Significant price increases of these materials and the cost of labor may negatively impact our cost of sales and, in turn, our net income.

 Net Sales, Backlog and Closings 
 A new order new sale is reported when a customer has received preliminary mortgage approval and the sales contract has been signed by the customer, approved by us and secured by a deposit. These deposits are typically nonrefundable, but each customer situation is evaluated individually. Sales to third-party investors that intend to lease the homes built-for-rent contracts are reported when the Company has received a nonrefundable deposit. 
 Net new orders (or net sales are sales of homes during the period less cancellations of existing sales contracts during the period. Our cancellation rate for a given period is calculated as the total number of sales contracts cancelled during the period, divided by the total number of new sales contracts entered into during the period. When a cancellation occurs, we generally retain the customer deposit and resell the home to a new customer. Cancellations can occur for various reasons outside of our control, including customer credit issues or changes in other personal circumstances. 
 The following tables present our net sales, starts and closings in each of our homebuilding segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (1) Excluding net sales under built-for-rent contracts, net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the Southeast segment increased 3 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included a built-for-rent contract termination discussed further below. 
 (2) Closings under built-for-rent contracts decreased 23 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our backlog of sold homes backlog consists of homes under contract that have not yet been delivered to a homebuyer or third-party investor. Backlog represents the number of homes in backlog from the previous period, plus net sales , minus the number of home closings during the period. Our backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations and the number of our active communities. 
 Homes in backlog are generally closed within one to nine months. The present shift towards spec home sales versus pre-order sales has led to a decrease in the number of homes remaining in backlog when compared to previous quarters. In addition, certain circumstances may impact our backlog conversion, such as built-for-rent contracts, which are customarily delivered over a longer period of time, as well as pre-order sales in new communities. The Company s backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control, and, in light of our minimal required deposit, there is little negative impact to the potential homebuyer from the cancellation of the sales contract.

 The following table presents our backlog in number of homes, ASP and aggregate value (in thousands) for our homebuilding segments as of the dates set forth below: 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 Segment Homes ASP Value Homes ASP Value Southeast 1,645 409,100 672,970 2,766 406,944 1,125,607 Mid-Atlantic (1)

 (1) Backlog as of September 30, 2024 includes 433 homes from our Crescent Homes acquisition. 
 Backlog of sold homes as of September 30, 2024 was 3,996 homes valued at approximately 2.0 billion based on ASP, a decrease of 1,029 homes and 0.4 billion in value, or 20 and 17 , respectively, from 5,025 homes valued at approximately 2.4 billion as of September 30, 2023. The overall decrease in backlog was mostly reflective of a continued trend toward move-in-ready spec homes relative to pre-order sales and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in built-for-rent contracts in backlog. Spec homes typically result in quicker closings and turnover of the backlog. Approximately 1,858 of the homes in our backlog are expected to be delivered in 2025 and beyond. 
 Southeast. Backlog for the Southeast segment as of September 30, 2024 was 1,645 homes, a decrease of 1,121 from 2,766 homes as of September 30, 2023. The decrease from prior year was primarily attributable to a continued trend toward more sales of move-in-ready spec homes relative to pre-order sales and a reduction in net sales under built-for-rent contracts. 
 Mid-Atlantic. Backlog for the Mid-Atlantic segment as of September 30, 2024 was 1,109 homes, an increase of 294 from 815 homes as of September 30, 2023. The increase in backlog from prior year was attributable to the Crescent Homes acquisition and, to a lesser extent, higher net sales relative to closings, partially offset by lower net sales relative to closings under built-for-rent contracts. 
 Midwest. Backlog for the Midwest segment as of September 30, 2024 was 1,242 homes, a decrease of 202 from 1,444 homes as of September 30, 2023. The decrease from prior year was mostly a result of higher closings relative to net sales, as well as the continued trend toward more sales of move-in-ready spec homes relative to pre-order sales. 
 The following table presents our cancellation rates for each of our homebuilding segments for the periods set forth below: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Segment 
 2024 2023 2024 2023 Southeast 13.6 20.6 26.6 20.5 Mid-Atlantic 13.9 7.6 10.8 12.5 Midwest 13.9 15.5 12.3 17.0 Total 13.8 14.9 15.8 17.1 
 Our cancellation rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.8 , an improvement when compared to the 14.9 cancellation rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our cancellation rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.8 , an improvement when compared to the 17.1 cancellation rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall improvement in cancellation rate was mostly a result of the trend toward higher spec sales relative to pre-order sales. The cancellation rate in the Southeast segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a built-for-rent contract of 229 units that was terminated during the first quarter of 2024 based on a strategic decision to convert the controlled lots underlying the deal into future retail sales. The total cancellation rate and the Southeast cancellation rate excluding built-for-rent activity were 12.2 and 12.8 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Financial Services 
 Our Financial Services segment provides mortgage financing and title services primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Jet HomeLoans and DF Title, respectively. The following table presents selected financial information and supplemental data for our Financial Services segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated):

 (1) Supplemental data reflects operations of Jet HomeLoans prior to its consolidation in the Company s financial statements beginning on that date. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 The 16 million, or 100 increase, in mortgage revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was due to the consolidation of Jet HomeLoans beginning July 1, 2024. 
 The 2 million, or 95 , and 4 million, or 64 , increases in title services revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were primarily a result of DF Title s expansion of operations into the Texas market. Our Texas market was previously serviced by our unconsolidated title joint ventures.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management utilizes specific non-GAAP financial measures as supplementary tools to evaluate operating performance. These include adjusted homebuilding gross margin, EBITDA, and net homebuilding debt to net capitalization. Other companies may not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner that we do. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as a supplement to relevant GAAP information, as reconciled for each measure below. In the future, we may incorporate additional adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures as we find them relevant and beneficial for both management and investors. 
 Adjusted Homebuilding Gross Margin 
 We define adjusted homebuilding gross margin as homebuilding gross margin excluding the effects of capitalized interest, lot option fees, amortization included in homebuilding cost of sales (adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions) and commission expense. Our management believes this information is meaningful because it isolates the impact that these excluded items have on homebuilding gross margin. We include internal and external commission expense in homebuilding cost of sales, not selling, general and administrative expense, and therefore commission expense is taken into account in homebuilding gross margin. 
 As a result, in order to provide a meaningful comparison to the public company homebuilders that include commission expense below the homebuilding gross margin line in selling, general and administrative expense, we have excluded commission expense from adjusted homebuilding gross margin. However, because adjusted homebuilding gross margin information excludes capitalized interest, lot option fees, purchase accounting amortization and commission expense, which have real economic effects and could impact our results of operations, the utility of adjusted homebuilding gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance may be limited. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted homebuilding gross margin to the GAAP financial measure of homebuilding gross margin for each of the periods indicated (unaudited and in thousands, except percentages): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Homebuilding gross margin (1)

 (1) Homebuilding gross margin is homebuilding revenues less homebuilding cost of sales. 
 (2) Includes interest charged to homebuilding cost of sales related to our construction lines of credit and senior unsecured notes, net, as well as lot option fees. 
 (3) Represents amortization of purchase accounting adjustments from the Crescent Homes acquisition. 
 (4) Calculated as a percentage of homebuilding revenues. 
 
 EBITDA 
 
 EBITDA is not a measure of net income as determined by GAAP. EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management and external users of our condensed consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income, (ii) capitalized interest charged in homebuilding cost of sales, (iii) interest expense, (iv) income tax expense and (v) depreciation and amortization. Management believes EBITDA is useful because it allows management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare our results of operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure or other items that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or any other measure as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our computations of EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA of other companies.

 Net Homebuilding Debt to Net Capitalization 
 
 Net homebuilding debt to net capitalization is a non-GAAP financial measure that is the sum of construction lines of credit and senior unsecured notes, net less cash and cash equivalents net homebuilding debt ), divided by the sum of net homebuilding debt, total mezzanine equity and total equity net capitalization ). Net homebuilding debt excludes borrowings under our mortgage warehouse facilities. Management believes the ratio of net homebuilding debt to net capitalization is meaningful as it is used to assess the performance of our homebuilding segments, as well as to establish targets for performance-based compensation. We also use this ratio as a measure of overall leverage.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We generate cash from the sale of our inventory and we intend to re-deploy the net cash generated from the sale of inventory to acquire and control land and further grow our operations year over year. We believe that our sources of liquidity are sufficient to satisfy our current commitments. We finance our operations through a variety of sources, including cash, borrowings under a revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement ), net proceeds from the senior unsecured notes 2028 Notes and mortgage warehouse facilities used in our financial services operations. 
 Our principal uses of capital are for lot deposits, lot purchases just-in-time for construction, vertical home construction, operating expenses, the payment of routine liabilities, business acquisitions and the origination of mortgage loans. Cash allocated to business acquisitions during 2024 was approximately 220 million as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash and total liquidity were as follows (in thousands): 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Borrowing base (1) 
 1,291,010 864,272 Outstanding balance under Credit Agreement (990,000) (530,000) Letters of credit outstanding (2) 
 (12,543) Availability under Credit Agreement 288,467 334,272 Cash and cash equivalents (3) 
 204,906 494,145 Total liquidity 493,373 828,417 
 (1) As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the borrowing base was reduced by the principal amount of the senior unsecured notes of 300 million. 
 (2) The availability under the Credit Agreement is reduced by outstanding letters of credit that are not fully cash collateralized. 
 (3) Includes cash and cash equivalents related to financial services operations. Amounts reported within cash and cash equivalents on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to financial services are not subject to restrictions and are regularly remitted to Corporate. 
 
 The Credit Agreement had an aggregate commitment of up to 1.4 billion. The Credit Agreement will mature on June 4, 2027. Certain of our subsidiaries guaranteed the Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement and the 2028 Notes. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants set forth for all of our debt obligations. Refer to Note 3, Debt, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the Credit Agreement, 2028 Notes and the mortgage warehouse facilities. 
 Cash flows generated by our projects can differ materially from our results of operations, as these depend upon the stage in the life cycle of each project. The majority of our projects begin at the land acquisition and development stage when we enter into finished lot option and land bank option contracts by placing a deposit with a land seller, developer or land banker. Our lot deposits are an asset on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Early stages in our communities require material cash outflows relating to finished lot purchases from option contracts, entitlements and permitting, construction and furnishing of model homes, roads, utilities, general landscaping and other amenities, as well as ongoing association fees and property taxes. Except for furnishings of model homes, these costs are capitalized within our real estate inventory and are not recognized as an expense until a home sale closes. As such, we incur significant cash outflows prior to the recognition of revenues and the related cost of sales. 
 In later stages of the life cycle of a community, cash inflows could significantly exceed our results of operations, as the cash outflows associated with land purchase and home construction and other expenses were previously incurred. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 We actively enter into finished lot option contracts by placing deposits with land sellers based on the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots. When entering into these contracts, we also agree to purchase finished lots at predetermined prices, time frames, and quantities that match our expected selling pace in the community. We also enter into land development arrangements with land sellers, land developers and land bankers. Furthermore, to satisfy performance-related obligations in connection with certain land option agreements, we enter into surety bonds and letters of credit arrangements. Refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements for additional information. 
 Our lot deposits are generally 100 applicable to the lot purchase price. In these transactions, we also incur lot option fees on the outstanding capital balance held by the land banker. The initial investment and lot option fees require us to have the ability to allocate liquidity resources to projects that will not generate cash inflows or operating income in the near term. 
 The above cash and land-light strategies allow us to maintain adequate lot supply in our existing markets and support ongoing growth and profitability. We continue to operate in geographic regions with consistent increases in demand for new homes and constrained lot and inventory supply compared to population and job growth trends. We intend to continue to reinvest our earnings into our business and focus on expanding our operations. In addition, as the opportunity to purchase finished lots in desired locations becomes increasingly more limited and competitive, we are committed to allocating additional liquidity to land bank deposits on land development projects, as this strategy mitigates the risks associated with holding undeveloped land on our balance sheet, while allowing us to control adequate lot supply in our key markets to support forecasted growth. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our lot deposits related to finished lot option contracts and land bank option contracts were 368 million and 247 million, respectively. 
 We continue to evaluate our overall capital structure and explore options to strengthen our balance sheet. We will remain opportunistic while assessing available capital in the debt and equity markets. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in)/provided by operating activities (563,103) 154,762 Net cash used in investing activities (197,537) (4,005) Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities 445,032 (182,586) 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 563 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 155 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash (used in)/provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increases in inventories as a result of higher construction starts and lot purchases, as well as, to a lesser extent, higher lot deposits, lower customer deposit activity in 2024 and the increase of mortgage loans held for sale resulting from the Jet HomeLoans acquisition on July 1, 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 198 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4 million of net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to the acquisition of Crescent Homes on February 1, 2024 for a purchase price of 210 million, of which 184 million was paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by cash acquired of 10 million for the Jet HomeLoans acquisition, which was in excess of 9 million of cash consideration paid for the transaction. To a lesser extent, the change was also driven by 14 million in cash paid for the purchase of an aircraft for corporate use. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 445 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 183 million of net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the construction lines of credit of 461 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 411 million of net payments for the construction lines of credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, there were 61 million of net proceeds from the mortgage warehouse facilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from the Jet HomeLoans acquisition. The increase in net cash provided by these financing activities was partially offset by the issuance of 300 million in senior unsecured notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which did not occur during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Series B Preferred Units 
 On August 31, 2023, the Company redeemed all of its previously outstanding Series B Preferred Units . Refer to Note 11, Equity to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the redemption. 
 Redeemable Preferred Stock 
 On September 29, 2021, we sold 150,000 shares of redeemable preferred stock with an initial liquidation preference of 1,000 per share and a par value of 0.01 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 150 million. We used the proceeds from the sale of the redeemable preferred stock to partially fund the MHI acquisition and for general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, the redeemable preferred stock ranks senior to the Class A and B common stock with respect to dividends and distributions on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. 
 Accordingly, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of redeemable preferred stock is entitled to receive the initial liquidation preference of 1,000 per share, subject to adjustment, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. 
 The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board of Directors has the authority to issue one or more series of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share, without stockholder approval. Refer to Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for further details on the terms of the redeemable preferred stock. 
 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

In accordance with DFH Crescent s limited liability company agreement, with the exception of certain acceleration clauses, the holder of the series B units and the Company are entitled to a series of put and call options beginning on February 1, 2032. The series B units have no liquidation preference, are not entitled to any dividends and have no voting rights.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Asset-Light Lot Acquisition Strategy 
 We operate an asset-light and capital-efficient lot acquisition strategy primarily through finished lot option contracts and land bank option contracts. See Land Acquisition and Development Process and Note 6, Variable Interest Entities to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information on these option contracts. 
 Surety Bonds, Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees 
 We enter into surety bonds and letters of credit arrangements with local municipalities, government agencies and land developers. These arrangements relate to certain performance-related obligations and serve as security for certain land option agreements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit totaling 256 million and 20 million, respectively. We believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related arrangements and do not anticipate any material losses under these surety bonds and letters of credit.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our operations are interest-rate sensitive. As overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in mortgage interest rates, a significant increase in interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing. Higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and net income. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Interest Rate Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations. Interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate sensitive assets, liabilities and commitments. Lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers, while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans. We have no market rate-sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, the Company has the ability to draw Term SOFR Rate Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Rate Loans . Term SOFR Rate Loans bear interest based on Term SOFR rates for one or three-month interest periods and include a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points for each interest period. Daily Simple SOFR Rate Loans bear interest based on Daily Simple SOFR rates and include a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points. Interest under Term SOFR Rate Loans and Daily Simple SOFR Rate Loans also include an applicable rate margin determined based on the Company s net debt to capitalization ratio, equivalent to credit spreads of 2.00 to 2.95 . 
 Interest on Base Rate or Daily Simple SOFR Rate advances borrowed under the Credit Agreement are payable in arrears on a monthly basis. Interest on Term SOFR rate advances borrowed under the Credit Agreement are payable in arrears at the end of the interest period applicable to such advance, or, if less than such interest period, three months after the beginning of such interest period. The Company pays the lenders a commitment fee on the amount of the unused commitments on a quarterly basis at a rate per annum that will vary from 0.20 to 0.30 depending on the Company s net debt to capitalization ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. 
 Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement are subject to, among other things, a borrowing base. The borrowing base includes, among other things, (a) 90 of the net book value of presold housing units, (b) 85 of the net book value of model housing units, (c) 85 of the net book value of speculative housing units, (d) 70 of the net book value of finished lots, (e) 85 of the net book value of certain built-for-rent units, and (f) 75 of the net book value of other built-for-rent units, in each case subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth in the Credit Agreement. The borrowing base availability is reduced dollar-for-dollar for any outstanding unsecured indebtedness permitted under the Credit Agreement. 
 Our wholly owned mortgage banking business, Jet HomeLoans, is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities. Jet HomeLoans underwrites and originates mortgage loans, which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets. The loan portfolio of Jet HomeLoans is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments. Jet HomeLoans also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files, furnishes, submits or otherwise provides the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, in such a manner as to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure.

 Changes in Internal Controls 
 Crescent Homes 
 We completed the Crescent Homes acquisition on February 1, 2024, which is discussed in detail in Note 2, Acquisitions to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Our assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures did not encompass the internal controls over financial reporting of Crescent Homes. This decision aligns with the general guidance from the SEC Staff, allowing the exclusion of an assessment of a recently acquired business from management s scope for an internal controls audit for up to one year post-acquisition. Crescent Homes contributed approximately 12 to our total revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the total assets of the acquired business represented about 7 of total consolidated assets, mainly comprising inventory and goodwill. 
 With the completion of the Crescent Homes acquisition, we have implemented internal controls over significant processes at Crescent Homes, which we consider appropriate and necessary given the integration level. As the integration progresses, we will continuously evaluate Crescent Homes internal controls and processes, further integrating them with those of the Company within a year of the acquisition. 
 Jet HomeLoans 
 We acquired the remaining equity interest in Jet HomeLoans on July 1, 2024, which is discussed in detail in Note 2, Acquisitions to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Our assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures did not encompass the internal controls over financial reporting of Jet HomeLoans. This decision aligns with the general guidance from the SEC Staff, allowing the exclusion of an assessment of a recently acquired business from management s scope for an internal controls audit for up to one year post-acquisition. Jet HomeLoans contributed approximately 1 to our total revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the total assets of the acquired business represented about 4 of total consolidated assets, mainly comprising mortgage loans held for sale. 
 With the completion of the Jet HomeLoans acquisition, we are in the process of implementing internal controls over significant processes at Jet HomeLoans, which we consider appropriate and necessary given the integration level. As the integration progresses, we will continuously evaluate Jet HomeLoans internal controls and processes, further integrating them with those of the Company within a year of the acquisition. 
 Other than the ongoing integrations of Crescent Homes and Jet HomeLoans described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are a party to ongoing legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe the results of currently pending proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There are numerous factors that affect our business and results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. Refer to Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 , and Item 1A in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which contain descriptions of significant risks that have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner. There have been no material changes to risk factors previously disclosed in the reports cited above. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Share Buyback Program

Refer to Note 11, Equity to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding the share buyback program. 
 We expect to execute any transactions under the share buyback program through a combination of Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and transactions made in compliance with Rule 10b-18. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the share buyback program will depend on a number of factors, including constraints specified in any Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. The share buyback program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares in any period, and may be expanded, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. The following table provides information with respect to repurchases of shares of Class A common stock by the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2024 :
