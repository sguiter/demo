on . The Company was established for the
operation of certain licensed and purchased software solutions. Since inception, the Company signed two license agreements with a related
party to license proprietary software technology solutions, i.e., Gigabyte Slayer and WARP-G. The Company has been focused in large part
on organizational activities and the development of its business plans to license the Gigabyte Slayer software application that is designed
to deliver live video streams, video downloads and large data files more efficiently by using new proprietary data compression technology
and to license the WARP-G software solution that is designed to enable enterprise customers that transmit live video streams, video downloads
and large data files to push such data over existing pipelines at higher speeds in less time also by using new proprietary data compression
technology. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company entered into several material definitive agreements as summarized below: 

1) 
 On
 June 14, 2024 Closing ), Mr. Ricardo Haynes, Mr. Eric Collins, Mr. Lance Lehr, Ms. Tori White and Mr. Donald Keer,
 each as an individual (the Purchasers personally acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of the Series
 A Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock of the Company from the Frank T. Perone Irrevocable Trust Trust ),
 a Florida trust (the Seller ), a Trust controlled by Mr. James Owens the Company s former CEO, founder and majority
 stockholder. 

2) 
 On
 June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a material definitive agreement with Electrical and Compression Optimization, Inc. ECO ),
 a Wyoming corporation owned and controlled by James Owens, for the acquisition of contracts, with a net book value of zero, from
 the Company. In exchange for the acquisition of the contracts ECO issued common shares directly to the stockholders of
 record of the Company at the close of business June 21, 2024 on a one-to-one basis. 

3) 
 One
 June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a material definitive agreement with Webnet Technologies Incorporated Webnet ),
 a Wyoming corporation owned and controlled by James Owens, for the acquisition of licenses for the use, development and commercialization
 of Gigabyte Slayer and WARP-G software. As consideration for the licenses, Webnet assumed liabilities of the Company, specifically
 related to accrued salaries and related expenses of and a cash payment of which was applied to Webstar s
 accounts payable at the time of the same amount. Due to the related party nature of the transaction, the assumption of the liabilities
 has been recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital of . 

4) 
 On
 June 24, 2024, the Company agreed to acquire the assets and intellectual property associated with the Bear Village, Inc. family resort
 developments from Thunder Energies Corporation, an entity owned and controlled by the Purchasers of the Company s Preferred
 Stock. An asset sale agreement was executed on July 15, 2024 between the Company and the selling entity. Pursuant to the agreement,
 the Company agreed to issue the selling entity shares of common as consideration for the assets acquired related to Bear
 Village, Inc. These shares were issued to the sellers on October 1, 2024 (see Note 6). 

As
a result of the sale of the Preferred Stock, discussed above, the existing officers and directors of the Company, Mr. James Owens, Mr.
Michael Hendrickson, Mr. Sanford Simon, and Mr. Don Roberts, were removed and replaced by the below as of June 14, 2024. 

Under
the terms of the Preferred Stock purchase agreement, the Purchases were permitted to elect representatives to serve on the Board of Directors
to fill the seat(s) vacated by prior directors and as new officers as follows: 

Chairman/Chief
Executive Officer - Mr. Ricardo Haynes 

 Independent
Director Ms. Marilyn Karpoff 

 Independent
Director Mr. Gordon Clinkscale 

 President
 Mr. Eric Collins 

 Interim
CFO Ms. Adrienne Anderson 

 Secretary
 Mr. Donald R. Keer 

 Chief
Operating Officer Mr. Lance Lehr 

and , respectively.
Further, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of and used cash in operations of ,
respectively. 

Based
on the current business plans and the Company s operating requirements, management believes that the existing cash at September
30, 2024 will not be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements.
These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s continued operations will depend on its ability to raise additional capital through various potential sources, such as
future equity offerings and/or debt financings, strategic relationships, and to successfully execute its business plans. The Company
has relied upon advances from related parties to fund operations since inception. Management is actively pursuing financing but can provide
no assurances that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Without this funding, the Company could be required
to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all its business plans which would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

The
unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts
or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company maintains its cash in bank and financial institutions
that at times may exceed federally insured (FDIC) limits. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did t have any cash
balances in excess of FDIC limits nor has the Company experienced any losses in such accounts through September 30, 2024. 

. The amortization period and amortization method of intangible assets other than
goodwill are reviewed at least at each balance sheet date. The effects of any revision are recognized in earnings when the changes arise.
The Company incurred amortization expense of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and and for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s intangible assets
had a net book value of .

have been excluded from loss per share as the inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 

and , respectively, for working capital need with no specific repayment terms. Further, during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, Mr. Owens provided the Company with consulting services on an as needed basis amounting to which increased
the due to stockholder amount and are included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying statements of operations.

On

of the Company s common stock at the conversion rate of per share, in accordance with the Note s convertible provision.
There was no gain or loss related to the partial conversion. 

On

Background
and Overview 

Webstar
Technology Group, Inc. (the Company was incorporated in Wyoming on March 10, 2015. The Company was established for the
operation of certain licensed and purchased software solutions. Since inception, the Company signed two letters of intent with a related
party to license proprietary software technology solutions, i.e., Gigabyte Slayer and WARP-G. The Company has been focused in large part
on organizational activities and the development of its business plans to license the Gigabyte Slayer software application that is designed
to deliver live video streams, video downloads and large data files more efficiently by using new proprietary data compression technology
and to license the WARP-G software solution that is designed to enable enterprise customers that transmit live video streams, video downloads
and large data files to push such data over existing pipelines at higher speeds in less time also by using new proprietary data compression
technology. The Company completed the license of Gigabyte Slayer and WARP-G software on April 21, 2020. On June 21, 2024, the license
agreement was acquired by Webnet, a Company owned and controlled by Mr. Owens.

2)

 related to accrued salaries and related expenses of 3,317,472 and a cash payment of 22,869 which was applied against Webstar s
 accounts payable at the time of the same amount. Due to the related party nature of the transaction, the assumption of the liabilities
 has been recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital of 3,340,341. 

4) 
 On
 June 24, 2024, the Company agreed to acquire the assets and intellectual property associated with the Bear Village, Inc. family resort
 developments from Thunder Energies Corporation, an entity owned and controlled by the Purchasers of the Company s Preferred
 Stock. An asset sale agreement was executed on July 15, 2024 between the Company and the selling entity. Pursuant to the agreement,

Results
of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenue 

Revenue
was 0 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Gross profit was 0 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Operating
Expenses 

Total
operating expenses, which are comprised of salaries and related expenses, and general and administrative expenses were 21,578 and 199,401
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in salary
and related expenses due to the Company s former CE and CFO resigning effective June 14, 2024 and March 4, 2024, respectively,
and not being replaced full time employees. The CFO was replaced by an external service provider, offset by a 60,000 consulting fee
incurred with Mr. Owens in 2024 that was not incurred in 2023. 

Total
operating expenses are comprised of salaries and related expenses, and general and administrative expenses were 4,466,798 and 703,524
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The
decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in salary and related expenses due to the Company s former CE and CFO resigning
effective June 14, 2024 and March 4, 2024, respectively, and not being replaced full time employees. The CFO was replaced by an external
service provider, offset by a 60,000 consulting fee incurred with Mr. Owens in 2024 that was not incurred in 2023.

Net
Loss 

The
net loss was 41,578 and 219,401 and 4,466,798 and 703,524 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The decrease in the loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the decrease in salary and related expenses
as discussed above. The increase in loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily a result of settlement of liabilities
with a related party of 427,638 through the issuance of shares of common stock with a fair value of 4,449,773 which resulted in a loss
on extinguishment of 4,021,910. 

Liquidity,
Going Concern and Uncertainties 

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024,
our working capital deficit amounted to 1,048,066 an increase of 3,323,316 as compared to working capital deficit of 4,371,382 as
of December 31, 2023. This increase in working capital deficit is primarily a result of the settlement of liabilities through the issuance
of shares of common stock and the assumption of liabilities by a related party for the transfer of certain license agreements. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 87,475 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 128,428 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the increase in net loss of
 3,763,274 and increase in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of 276,483 , offset by noncash expenses of 4,080,710. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 87,459 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 128,420 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash from financing activities was the result of an increase in cash advances received from
our controlling stockholder and a related party 

The
unaudited financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate the
continuation of the Company as a going concern. To date, the Company s commercial operations have not generated adequate revenues
to enable profitability. Based on the current business plans and the Company s operating requirements, management believes that
the current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months following the issuance of these
financial statements. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s continued operations will depend on its ability to raise additional capital through various potential sources, such as
equity offerings and/or debt financing, strategic relationships, and to successfully execute its business plans. Management is actively
pursuing financing but can provide no assurances that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Without this funding,
the Company could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its business plans which would likely have a material
adverse effect on the Company. 

The
unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets carrying amounts
or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Generally,
the Company s operations are subject to a number of factors that can affect its operating result and financial condition. Such
factors include, but are not limited to, the results of our marketing efforts to promote users for our software solutions, successful
launch and acceptance of our software solutions in the marketplace, competition of our software solutions, attraction of talented and
skilled employees to support the business and the ability to raise capital to support its operations. 

Since
our inception, we have been funded by loans from our controlling shareholder, James Owens. The loans from Mr. Owens are pursuant to an
oral agreement, are non-interest bearing and payable upon demand by Mr. Owens. Mr. Owens has orally agreed not to demand repayment of
his loans until such time as we have sufficient capital resources to repay such loans. We currently have no agreements, arrangements
or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. There can be no assurance
that additional capital will be available to us. Since we have no other such arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability
to raise funds for the above purposes that exceed our current working capital will have a severe negative impact on our ability to remain
a viable company. 

17 

Management s
plan is to obtain such resources for our capital needs by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to
meet its operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in accomplishing any of our
plans. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding
paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we were unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our unaudited financial statements included herein for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024 and in the notes to our annual report 10-K which includes audited financial statements for the years
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. We believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate
our financial condition and results of operations. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of the unaudited financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain of our
estimates, including evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, could be affected by external conditions, including those
unique to our industry, and general economic conditions. It is possible that these external factors could have an effect on our estimates
that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates. We re-evaluate all of our accounting estimates at least quarterly based
on these conditions and record adjustments when necessary. Significant estimates made by management include the valuation of deferred
tax assets and fair value of shares of common stock. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration
which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company anticipates receiving revenue from licensing
its software to customers. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the
scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract;
(ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context
of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the
transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance
obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration
it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. 

The
Company recognized no revenue from licensing fees during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

18 

Leases 

The
Company accounts for leases under ASU 2016-02. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets
and operating lease liabilities on the unaudited balance sheets. The Company leased office equipment used to conduct our business. The
lease was transferred to a related party on April 1, 2023. 

Operating
lease ROU assets represent the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based
on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases do not provide an
implicit rate, the Company used an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining
the present value of future payments. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included
in general and administrative expenses in the unaudited statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, the Company recorded 0 and 0, respectively, and 0 and 438, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023 as operating lease expense which is included in general and administrative expenses on the unaudited statements of operations. As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unamortized right-of-use assets resulting from the lease were 0 and 0, respectively,
and the lease liabilities were 0 and 0, respectively.

have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
