 million arising from a residual economic interest in a salvaged shipwreck. The balance of those proceeds, together with other anticipated cash inflows, is expected to provide sufficient operating funds through at least the fourth quarter of 2024. Our consolidated non-restricted cash balance at September 30, 2024 was million . We have a working capital deficit at September 30, 2024 of million . The total consolidated book value of our assets was approximately million at September 30, 2024, which includes cash of million . The fair market value of these assets may differ from their net carrying book value. The factors noted above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

of the equity interests in CIC Limited CIC ), a deep-sea mineral exploration company. The Company s lead director, Mark B. Justh, made an investment into CIC s parent company and indirectly owns approximately of CIC. We believe Mr. Justh s indirect ownership in CIC does not impair his independence under applicable rules, and Odyssey s board of directors has formed a special committee of disinterested directors to address any matters relating to CIC. The Company is providing services to CIC in accordance with the terms of a Services Agreement pursuant to which Odyssey provides certain back-office services to CIC in exchange for a recurring monthly fee, as well as other deep-sea mineral related services on a cost-plus profit basis and is compensated for these services with a combination of cash and equity in CIC. We invoiced CIC for technical services a total of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are recorded in Marine services in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company is paid in equity for its services. In addition, the Company has the option to accept equity for payment of cash expenditures due from CIC in lieu of cash. The Company has not opted to accept equity from CIC in lieu of cash for its cash expenditures. Ocean Minerals, LLC The Company provides services to Ocean Minerals, LLC OML ), a deep-sea mineral exploration company in which we hold approximately of the equity interests (see Note 6, Investment in Unconsolidated Entities ). The Company is providing these services to OML pursuant to the Contribution Agreement (defined below) that provides for deep-sea mineral related services on a cost-plus profit basis and will be compensated for these services with equity in OML. See Note 6, Investment in Unconsolidated Entities, for amounts the Company invoiced OML during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Salvage Agreement The Company held a interest in proceeds under a salvage agreement from our legacy shipwreck business. A company controlled by Mr. Justh obtained the right to the remaining of those proceeds from an unrelated third party in exchange for the obligation to finance legal expenses relating to the recovery of the proceeds, pursuant to a funding arrangement to which the Company is also a party. Odyssey and Mr. Justh s controlled entity were responsible for any remaining legal costs on a pro rata basis.

Approximately million was advanced to ExO and Oceanica between 2012 and 2014, and approximately million between 2015 and 2017; the balance has been advanced since 2017. In addition, Odyssey provides management and administrative services to ExO and funds ExO s ongoing administrative expenses pursuant to a services agreement in exchange for a recurring monthly fee and reimbursement of funded amounts.

Investment in unconsolidated entities 

CIC Limited Due to the structure of CIC, we determined this venture to be a VIE consistent with ASC 810. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, we have not consolidated this entity. We record our investment under the cost method as this company is incorporated and we have determined we do not exercise significant influence over the entity. We provide services to CIC, as detailed in Note 5, Related Party Transactions . We assess our investment for impairment annually and, if a loss in value is deemed other than temporary, an impairment charge will be recorded.

membership interest units of OML (the Purchased Units for a total purchase price of million. After giving effect to the issuance and sale of all the Purchased Units, the Purchased Units would have represented approximately of the issued and outstanding membership interest units of OML (based upon the number of membership interest units ou tstanding on June 1, 2023). On July 3, 2023, the Purchaser purchased of the Purchased Units (the Initial OML Units . On October 18, 2024, Odyssey and OML entered into a Termination Agreement pursuant to which the parties terminated the OML Purchase Agreement (the Termination Agreement ). The Termination Agreement terminated the parties respective rights and obligations relating to the Second OML Units, the Third OML Units and the Optional Units (each as defined below), but did not affect Odyssey s ownership of the Initial OML Units or the obligation to pay the lease payments for the Retriever asset as described below. The Termination Agreement did not affect the Equity Exchange Agreement or the Contribution Agreement (each as defined below), each of which remains in effect. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Odyssey owned approximately and , respectively, of the issued and outstanding membership interest units of OML. The Company determined that OML is a VIE as it does not have sufficient equity at-risk to permit OML to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. However, as Odyssey s lack of power to direct the activities that most significantly impact OML s economic performance, it is not the primary beneficiary of OML and therefore is not required to consolidate OML. We record our investment under the equity method. Equity Exchange Agreement In connection with the transactions contemplated by the OML Purchase Agreement, Odyssey and the existing members of OML entered into an Equity Exchange Agreement (the Equity Exchange Agreement pursuant to which such members of OML have the right, but not the obligation, to exchange membership interest units of OML held by them for shares of Odyssey s common stock. Notwithstanding anything in the Equity Exchange Agreement to the contrary, the aggregate maximum number of shares of Odyssey s common stock that may be issued under the Equity Exchange Agreement will not (a) exceed of the number of outstanding shares of Odyssey s common stock immediately prior to the date of the Equity Exchange Agreement, (b) exceed of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of Odyssey immediately prior to the date of the Equity Exchange Agreement, or (c) otherwise exceed such number of shares of Odyssey s common stock that would violate applicable listing rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Equity Exchange Agreement is a liability within the scope of ASC 480 that is initially measured at fair value and was included within the initial consideration transferred. Subsequently, changes in the fair value of the liability will be recognized in earnings and not as an adjustment to the cost basis of the Company s investment in OML. Contribution Agreement In connection with the transactions contemplated by the OML Purchase Agreement, Odyssey, the Purchaser, and OML also entered into a Contribution Agreement pursuant to which additional membership interest units of OML may be issued to the Purchaser in consideration of the contribution to OML by Odyssey from time to time of certain property or other assets and services with an aggregate value of up to million Contribution Agreement ). We concluded that the Contribution Agreement is within the scope of ASC 606, as the services provided are within Odyssey s ordinary activities, and OML is therefore, considered a customer of Odyssey.

and has greater than virtually no influence over OML, the investment is within the scope of ASC 323, Investments Equity and Joint Ventures. Odyssey applied the equity method investment accounting for its interest in OML, starting on July 3, 2023. As a result, OML is considered a related party. The Company further concluded that the initial closing consideration transferred is million, and includes the cash amount paid, the fair value of the contribution of ORI, the fair value of the second and third closings and Equity Exchange Agreement, and acquisition costs. Furthermore, the total consideration transferred is allocated to the different components identified in the OML Purchase Agreement based on their closing date fair value, including, (1) the Initial OML Units, (2) the Second OML Units option, (3) the Third OML Units option and (4) the Optional Units, each as defined below, as well as the Equity Exchange Agreement as previously defined above. Through a series of transactions pursuant to the OML Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to pay a total purchase price of million, or per unit, for units, as follows: (1) The Initial Closing The Company purchased the Initial OML Units, representing approximately of the OML Units, in return for the initial purchase price of million cash and Odyssey s shares of ORI. The initial closing of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Units was amended to July 3, 2023. 

 (2) The Second Closing The Company agreed to purchase of the Purchase Units (the Second OML Units in return for the second purchase price of million, payable in cash at that time Second Closing ). The parties entered into the third amendment to the OML Purchase Agreement to amend the closing date of the Second Closing to be February 16, 2024, the fourth amendment to amend the closing date of the Second Closing to June 28, 2024, and the fifth amendment to amend the closing date of the Second Closing to September 30, 2024. 

 (3) The Third Closing The Company agreed to purchase of the Purchased Units (the Third OML Units in return for the purchase price of million, payable in cash at that time. Pursuant to the fifth amendment to the OML Purchase Agreement, the third closing Third Closing will occur on the date that is six months from the date of the Second Closing. 

 (4) Optional Units The Company has the option to purchase up to additional of OML Interest Units the Units ), at the Company s discretion Optional Units ), at the agreed upon price of per unit within the eighteen-month anniversary of the Initial Closing Date, July 3, 2023. The recorded asset value of this option is million on September 30, 2024. The Optional Units are within the scope of ASC 321 and would therefore, be initially recognized at cost as part of the initial consideration transferred, and thereafter, will be accounted for under the measurement alternative at cost with adjustments related to impairment and observable market conditions. If the Company does not purchase all the Optional Units prior to the eighteen-month anniversary, the Company may purchase any of such unpurchased Optional Units at the higher price of (i) a discount of to the price paid for which OML sold the Units in the most recent transaction for the Units immediately preceding such discounted purchase of Optional Units or (ii) . On October 17, 2023, the parties entered into the third amendment to the OML Purchase Agreement to remove the second part of the Optional Units provision. Therefore, as of the amendment date, the Company may only purchase the Optional Units through January 2, 2025 (eighteen months from the Initial Closing Date) Optional Units Amendment ). 

 The Company concluded that the Second OML Units option, the Third OML Units option and the Optional Units are within the scope of ASC 321 Investments Equity and Joint Ventures and would therefore be initially recognized at cost as part of the initial consideration transferred, and thereafter will be accounted for under the measurement alternative at cost with adjustments related to impairment and observable market adjustments. The Company concluded that the Contribution Agreement is within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as the services provided are within the Company s ordinary activities, and OML is therefore considered a customer of Odyssey. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we invoiced OML for technical services a total of and million, respectively, recorded in Marine services in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company concluded that the Equity Exchange Agreement is a liability within the scope of ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, that is initially measured at fair value and will be included within the initial consideration transferred. Subsequently, changes in the fair value of the liability will be recognized in earnings and not as an adjustment to the cost basis of Odyssey s investment in OML. As part of the Initial Closing, Odyssey transferred its equity interest of ORI, free of debt of the finance liability owed on the sale-leaseback arrangement. This portion was determined to be part of the Initial Consideration Transferred, as of July 3, 2023, as it meets the definition of a subsidiary of the acquirer. ASC 805, Business Combination, further provides that the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, determined in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, except for (i) assets and liabilities transferred that remain under the control of the acquiree after the business combination, and (ii) any portion of the acquirer s shared-based replacement awards exchanged for awards held by the acquiree s grantees included in the consideration transferred. Therefore, the Company determined that although the OML Purchase Agreement provides that the contractual amount of ORI is million, the 

 14 

million. The Company transferred ORI but retained the obligation to pay the lease payments for the Retriever asset as the Company retained the obligation to continue making payments. The net book value of ORI as of July 3, 2023 was million. Therefore, at the Closing Date, Odyssey recognized a Gain on the sale of an entity in the consolidated statement of operations in the amount of million related to the disposal of ORI.

March 2023 Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement On March 6, 2023, Odyssey entered into a Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the March 2023 Note Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor pursuant to which Odyssey issued and sold to the investor (a) a promissory note (the March 2023 Note in the principal amount of up to million and (b) a warrant (the March 2023 Warrants and, together with the March 2023 Note, the Securities to purchase shares of our Common Stock. On January 30, 2024, the March 2023 Warrants were amended to add a cashless exercise provision. Due to that amendment, the Company determined that the March 2023 Warrants meet the definition of a derivative and are not considered indexed to the Company s own stock due to the settlement adjustment that provides that the share price input upon cashless exercise is always based on the highest of three prices. As such, the March 2023 Warrants are now recognized as a derivative liability, which was initially measured at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings in the period incurred. The amended March 2023 Warrants were measured using the Black-Scholes valuation method on January 30, 2024, and re-classified from equity to warrant liability. The difference between the warrant liability and the initial equity balance was recognized as an additional discount to additional paid-in capital APIC ). The change in fair value of the March 2023 Warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a decrease of million and a decrease of million, respectively, which has been recorded in the change in derivative liabilities fair value in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

million and (b) two tranches of warrants (the December 2023 Warrants and, together with the December 2023 Notes, the December 2023 Securities to purchase shares of our Common Stock. The Company determined that the December 2023 Warrants meet the definition of a derivative and are not considered indexed to the Company s own stock due to the settlement adjustment that provides that the share price input upon cashless exercise is always based on the highest of three prices. As such, the December 2023 Warrants were recognized as derivative liabilities and were initially measured at fair value with subsequent gains or losses due to changes in fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Company noted that when debt is issued with liability-classified stock purchase warrants, the residual method should be used so that the warrants are recognized at fair value at issuance and the residual proceeds are allocated to the debt. We incurred in related expenses, which are being amortized over the term of the December 2023 Note Purchase Agreement and charged to interest expense. The total proceeds of million were allocated between debt and warrant liability by recognizing the warrants at their full fair value and allocating the residual proceeds to the December 2023 Notes. The initial fair value of the December 2023 Warrants was million, resulting in a corresponding discount on the December 2023 Notes which is being amortized over the remaining term of the December 2023 Note Purchase Agreement using the effective interest method, which is charged to interest expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded million and million, respectively, of interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount and and , respectively, of interest from the fee amortization. At September 30, 2024 , the carrying value of the debt was million and was net of unamortized debt fees of , net of unamortized debt discount of million associated with the fair value of the warrants. The change in fair value of the December 2023 Warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a decrease of million and a decrease of million, respectively, which has been recorded in the change in derivative liabilities fair value in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The total face value of this obligation at September 30, 2024 was million. The current interest rate of the December 2023 Notes was . Emergency Injury Disaster Loan The Company obtained an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (the EIDL Loan from the United States Small Business Administration (the SBA with a principal amount of , which was used for working capital purposes.

On September 13, 2024, Mr. Pignatelli converted all outstanding principal and interest under the note, amounting to million, to shares of our Common Stock. Accordingly, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company issued shares of our Common Stock to Mr. Pignatelli and the balance of the note at September 30, 2024 amounted to . 37North On June 29, 2023, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement Note Agreement with 37North SPV 11, LLC 37N pursuant to which 37N agreed to loan us million. The proceeds from this transaction were received in full on June 29, 2023. Pursuant to the Note Agreement, the indebtedness was non-interest bearing and matured on July 30, 2023. The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in connection with conversion of the indebtedness is not to exceed (i) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock prior to the date of the Agreement, (ii) of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities, or (iii) such number of shares of Common Stock that would violate the applicable listing rules of the Principal Market if the stockholders did not approve the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion of the indebtedness. Any time prior to maturity, the Company had the option to prepay the indebtedness at an amount of of the unpaid principal. of the unpaid amount of the indebtedness. of the unpaid amount of the indebtedness after days notice. If 37N delivers an exercise notice during this 10-day period, the note issued pursuant to the Note Agreement (the 37N Note would be converted to shares of Common Stock, instead of being repaid. As of September 30, 2024, we have not repaid this Note Agreement. If 37N delivers an exercise notice and the number of shares issuable is limited by the limitation outlined above, then we are permitted to repay all the remaining unpaid amount of the Loan in an amount equal to of the remaining unpaid amount. On December 27, 2023, 37N delivered an exercise notice to us pursuant to which it exercised its right to convert of the outstanding indebtedness under the Note Agreement into shares of our Common Stock. In accordance with the Note Agreement, based on the applicable conversation rate of under the agreement, we issued shares of our Common Stock to 37N on December 29, 2023. In June 2024, 37N delivered an exercise notice to us pursuant to which it exercised its right to convert of the outstanding indebtedness under the Note Agreement into shares of our Common Stock. In accordance with the Note Agreement, based on the applicable conversation rate of , we issued shares of our Common Stock to 37N on June 24, 2024. In July 2024, 37N delivered an exercise notice to us pursuant to which it exercised its right to convert of the outstanding indebtedness under the Note Agreement into shares of our Common Stock. In accordance with the Note Agreement, based on the applicable conversation rate of , we issued shares of our Common Stock to 37N on July 18, 2024. In September 2024, 37N delivered an exercise notice to us pursuant to which it exercised its right to convert of the outstanding indebtedness under the Note Agreement into shares of our Common Stock. In accordance with the Note Agreement, based on the applicable conversation rate of , we issued shares of our Common Stock to 37N on September 12, 2024. We evaluated the indebtedness and, based on the criteria of ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and 815 Derivatives and Hedging, the 37N convertible note is classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet with a share settled redemption feature that is recorded as an embedded derivative. As a result, the share settled redemption and conversion features were recorded at fair value at each reporting period outstanding with changes recognized through Interest expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. The Company analyzed the conversion feature of the note and determined that, because it includes a conditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares based on a fixed amount known at inception, the debt is properly classified as a liability in the balance sheet. The Company identified seven embedded features, all of which were of de minimis fair value other than the Share Settled Redemption Feature. As such, only that was bifurcated and accounted for separately

At September 30, 2024, the Company recorded the 37N Note at fair value, Level 3, for which the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company s debt instruments are generally based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in an active market. The Equity Exchange Agreement, which results in a Put option liability (the Put Option ), and Litigation financing are measured at fair value, Level 3. The OML Put Option valuation was based on the exercise period of the Equity Exchange Agreement, share price and volatility. The Litigation financing valuation was based on the following assumptions: amounts funded by the Funder, the corresponding IRR calculation, applicable percentage applicable to the recovery percentage calculation and management s good-faith estimates for estimated outcome probabilities and estimated debt repayment dates. The 2022 Warrants, the December 2023 Warrants and the March 2023 Warrants are measured at fair value, Level 3, using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The assumptions used in this model included the use of key inputs, including expected stock volatility, the risk free interest rate, the expected life of the option and the expected dividend yield. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of our Common Stock over the term of the warrant. Risk free interest rates are calculated based on risk free rates for the appropriate term. The expected life is estimated based on contractual terms as well as expected exercise dates. The dividend yield is based on the historical dividends issued by us. If the volatility rate or risk-free interest rate were to change, the value of the warrants would be impacted.

Additional information about the Litigation financing liability, the 2022 Warrants, the December 2023 Warrants and the March 2023 Warrants is included in Note 9, Loans Payable . Derivative Financial Instruments Litigation financing On June 14, 2019, Odyssey and ExO (together, the Claimholder ), and Poplar Falls LLC (the Funder entered into an International Claims Enforcement Agreement (the Agreement ), as amended in January 2020, December 2020, June 2021 and March 2023, pursuant to which the Funder agreed to provide financial assistance to the Claimholder to facilitate the prosecution and recovery of the claim by the Claimholder against the United Mexican States under Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA for violations of the Claimholder s rights under NAFTA related to the development of an undersea phosphate deposit off the coast of Baja Sur, Mexico (the Project ), on our own behalf and on behalf of ExO and United Mexican States (the Subject Claim ). Pursuant to the Agreement, as amended, the Funder agreed to specified fees and expenses regarding the Subject Claim (the Claims Payments incrementally and at the Funder s sole discretion. The Company determined that the financing arrangement was a derivative, measured at fair value within the scope of ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging . Subsequently, any changes in the fair value of the derivative are reported in earnings for the period. Fair value was calculated as the midpoint of estimated ranges of the probability-weighted present value of potential results based on management assumptions. As such, the fair value of the obligation is recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in Litigation financing and other and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 amounted to million and million, respectively, with changes in the fair value of an increase of million and an increase of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and an increase of million and an increase million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On September 17, 2024, the Company received notification from the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ICSID of the arbitral award on the claims brought by the Company on behalf of itself and ExO, against the United Mexican States under Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA ). The arbitral tribunal issued an award in favor of the Company and ExO. The award orders Mexico to pay million for breaching its obligations under NAFTA, plus interest at the one-year Mexico Treasury bond rate, compounded annually, from October 12, 2018, until the

shares of our Common Stock and the 2022 Warrants to holders to purchase up to shares of our Common Stock 2022 Warrants ). The net proceeds received from sale, after offering expenses of million, were million. The shares of common stock and warrants were sold in units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of (the 2022 Warrant Price per share of common stock. Each unit was sold at a negotiated price of per unit. The 2022 Warrants are exercisable at any time beginning on , and ending on the close of business on . The Company determined that the 2022 Warrants meet the definition of a derivative and are not considered indexed to the Company s own stock due to the input related to the price per share and any non-cash consideration. Management determined that this input would preclude the 2022 Warrants from being indexed to the Company s stock given that this input could be affected by variables that are extraneous to the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option or forward contract on equity shares. As such, the 2022 Warrants were recognized as derivative liabilities and will be initially and subsequently measured at fair value with the gain or loss due to changes in fair value recognized in the current period. The Company noted that when debt is issued with liability-classified stock purchase warrants, the residual method should be used so that the warrants are recognized at fair value at issuance and the residual proceeds are allocated to the debt. The fair value of the obligation on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively, with changes in the fair value of a decrease of million and an increase of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and decreases of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Simultaneously with each sale, the subsidiaries entered into lease agreements with each buyer of the respective marine equipment (the sale of the property and simultaneous leaseback is referred to as a sale-leaseback ). The Company accounted for the sale-leaseback transactions as financing transactions with the purchasers of the property in accordance with ASC Topic 842 as the lease agreements were determined to be finance leases. The Company concluded the lease agreements both met the qualifications to be classified as finance leases due to the obligation to repurchase the equipment. ORI was one of Odyssey s subsidiaries that entered into one of the sale-leaseback financing obligations noted above. As noted in Note 6, Investment in Unconsolidated Entity , Odyssey transferred all of its shares in ORI to OML as part of the Investment in OML.

ITEM 2. MA NAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our results of operation and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the related notes to the financial statements and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 regarding the Company s expectations concerning its future operations, earnings and prospects. On the date the forward-looking statements are made, the statements represent the Company s expectations, but the expectations concerning its future operations, earnings and prospects may change. The Company s expectations involve risks and uncertainties and are based on many assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable, but such assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate or incomplete, in whole or in part. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Company s expectations and the forward-looking statements will be correct. Please refer to the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from the expectations stated in this discussion. Odyssey disclaims any obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements except as required by law. 
 
 Operational Update 
 
 Additional information regarding our announced projects can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Only projects that are material in nature or with material status updates are discussed below. We may have other projects in various stages of planning or execution that may not be disclosed for security or legal reasons until considered appropriate by management or required by law. 
 Our subsea project portfolio contains multiple projects in various stages of development throughout the world and across different mineral resources. We regularly evaluate prospective resources to identify new projects. In addition to conducting geological assessments, we also analyze licensing regulations to assure rights can be secured, business development models, and commercial viability factors; all which factor into our decision making on whether and how to pursue opportunities in the best interest of our stockholders. 
 
 Subsea Mineral Exploration Projects 
 
 ExO Phosphate Project: 
 
 The Exploraciones Oce nicas Phosphate Project is a rich deposit of phosphate sands located 70-90 meters deep within Mexico s Exclusive Economic Zone EEZ ). This deposit contains a large amount of high-grade phosphate ore that can be extracted on a financially attractive basis (essentially a standard dredging operation). The product will be desirable to Mexican and other world producers of fertilizers and can provide important benefits to Mexico s agricultural development. 
 The deposit lies within an exclusive mining concession licensed to the Mexican company Exploraciones Oce nicas S. de R.L. de CV ExO ). Oceanica Resources, S. de R.L., a Panamanian company Oceanica owns 99.99 of ExO, and Odyssey owns 56.04 of Oceanica through Odyssey Marine Enterprises, Ltd., a wholly owned Bahamian company Enterprises ). 
 In 2012, ExO was granted a 50-year mining license by Mexico (extendable for another 50 years at ExO s option) for the deposit that lies 25-40 km offshore in Baja California Sur. 
 We spent more than three years preparing an environmentally sustainable development plan with the assistance of experts in marine dredging and leading environmental scientists from around the world. Key features of the environmental plan included: 
 
 No chemicals would be used in the dredging process or released into the sea. 

A specialized return down pipe that exceeds international best practices to manage the return of dredged sands close to the seabed, limiting plume or impact to the water column and marine ecosystem (including primary production). 

The seabed would be restored after dredging in such a way as to promote rapid regeneration of seabed organisms in dredged areas. 

Ecotoxicology tests demonstrated that the dredging and return of sediment to the seabed would not have toxic effects on organisms. 

Sound propagation studies concluded that noise levels generated during dredging would be similar to whale-watching vessels, merchant ships and commercial fishing ships that already regularly transit this area, proving the system is not a threat to marine mammals. 

25 

Dredging limited to less than one square kilometer each year, which means the project would operate in only a tiny proportion of the concession area each year. 

Proven turtle protection measures were incorporated, even though the deposit and the dredging activity are much deeper and colder than where turtles feed and live, making material harm to the species highly remote. 

There will be no material impact on local fisheries as fishermen have historically avoided the water column directly above the deposit due to the naturally low occurrence of fish there. 

The project would not be visible from the shoreline and would not impact tourism or coastal activities. 

Precautionary mitigation measures were incorporated into the development plan in line with best-practice global operational standards. 

The technology proposed to recover the phosphate sands has been safely used in Mexican waters for over 20 years on more than 200 projects. 

Notwithstanding the factors stated above, in April 2016 the Mexican Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources SEMARNAT unlawfully rejected the permit to move forward with the project. 
 ExO challenged the decision in Mexican federal court and in March 2018, the Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa TFJA ), an 11-judge panel, ruled unanimously that SEMARNAT denied the application in violation of Mexican law and ordered the agency to re-take its decision. Just prior to the change in administration later in 2018, SEMARNAT denied the permit a second time in defiance of the court. ExO once again challenged the unlawful SEMARNAT decision before the TFJA. On October 25, 2024, the TFJA announced its ruling in favor of SEMARNAT. ExO expects to appeal the TFJA s ruling. 
 In April 2019, we filed a claim under the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA against Mexico to protect our stockholders interests and significant investment in the project. Our claim sought compensation on the basis that SEMARNAT s wrongful repeated denial of authorization has destroyed the value of our investment in violation of NAFTA. 
 On June 14, 2019, Odyssey and ExO executed an agreement that provided up to 6.5 million in funding for prior, current and future costs of the NAFTA action. On January 31, 2020, this agreement was amended and restated, as a result of which the availability increased to 10.0 million. In December 2020, Odyssey announced it secured an additional 10.0 million from the funder to aid in our NAFTA case. On June 14, 2021, the funder agreed to fund up to an additional 5.0 million for arbitration costs. The funder will not have any right of recourse against us unless the environmental permit is awarded or if proceeds are received (See Note 9, Loans Payable). 
 On September 17, 2024, the Company received notification from the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ICSID of the arbitral award on the claims brought by the Company on behalf of itself and ExO, against the United Mexican States under Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA ). The arbitral tribunal issued an award in favor of the Company and ExO. The award orders Mexico to pay 37.1 million for breaching its obligations under NAFTA, plus interest at the one-year Mexico Treasury bond rate, compounded annually, from October 12, 2018, until the award is paid in full, plus the arbitrators fees and ICSID administrative costs. The amounts awarded are net of Mexican taxes and Mexico may not tax the award. 
 In October 2024, the Company discovered that the Mexican mining authority unlawfully cancelled ExO s mining concessions in June and August 2024. ExO is challenging the cancellation. 
 CIC Project: 
 
 CIC Limited CIC is a deep-sea mineral exploration company. CIC is supported by a consortium of companies providing expertise and financial contributions in support of development of the project. Odyssey is a member of the consortium, which also includes Royal Boskalis Westminster. 
 
 In February 2022, the Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority SBMA awarded CIC a five-year exploration license beginning June 2022. Offshore explorations and research commenced in the third quarter of 2022 with positive results in early sampling and testing of vessels and equipment, which informed requirements for viable operational functions as the basis for a longer-term operation over the license period. The early operations also resulted in preliminary resource sampling, which will ultimately accrue to the resource evaluation and regional environmental assessment. 
 
 Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we have earned and now hold approximately 15.3 of the current outstanding equity units of CIC issued in exchange for provision of services by the Company. 
 
 26 

We have the ability to earn up to an aggregate of 20.0 million equity units over the next calendar year, which represents an approximate 16.0 interest in CIC, based upon the currently outstanding equity units. This means we can earn approximately 1.1 million additional equity units in CIC under our current services agreement. We achieved our current equity position through the provision of services rendered to CIC (see Note 6, Investment In Unconsolidated Entity ). 
 
 Ocean Minerals, LLC Project: 
 Ocean Minerals, LLC OML is a deepwater critical minerals exploration and development company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Moana Minerals Limited Moana Minerals is a wholly owned subsidiary of OML and is a deepwater critical metals exploration and development company incorporated in the Cook Islands with offices and operations based in Rarotonga, Cook Islands. In February 2022, the SBMA awarded Moana Minerals a five-year exploration license EL3 for a 23,630 square kilometer area in the Cook Islands EEZ. 
 Moana Minerals has validated vast polymetallic nodule resources in its exploration license area and, pursuant to the SBMA s standards and guidelines, it is conducting further exploration activities to increase confidence in the reported mineral resource and size of the reported mineral resources and to secure environmental approvals to perform commercial operations. OML and its project partners are also advancing work to develop recovery systems to harvest these high-quality seafloor polymetallic nodules and processing solutions to convert them into commercial grade metals. 
 On June 4, 2023, Odyssey entered into a purchase agreement to acquire an approximately 13 interest in OML in exchange for a contribution by Odyssey of its interest in its then wholly owned subsidiary, ORI, whose sole asset was a 6,000-meter remotely operated vehicle ROV ), cash contributions of up to 10.0 million in a series of transactions over the following year, a Contribution Agreement and an Equity Exchange Agreement. On July 3, 2023, the parties consummated the initial closing of the purchase agreement, pursuant to which Odyssey s wholly owned subsidiary obtained approximately 6.28 of OML s outstanding equity interests. On October 18, 2024, Odyssey and OML entered into a Termination Agreement pursuant to which the parties terminated the OML Purchase Agreement. The Termination Agreement terminated the parties rights and obligations relating to the Second OML Units, Third OML Units and Optional Units (see Note 6, Investment In Unconsolidated Entity ), but did not affect Odyssey s ownership of the Initial OML Units or its obligation to pay the lease payments for the Retriever asset (see Note 6, Investment In Unconsolidated Entity ). The Termination Agreement also did not affect the Equity Exchange Agreement or Contribution Agreement (each as defined above), each of which remains in effect. 
 The 6,000-meter rated ROV contributed to OML by Odyssey provides OML with an additional tool to advance the project toward eventual applications for an environmental permit and harvesting license when exploration and feasibility studies are completed and demonstrate how harvesting can be done without serious environmental harm. OML continues to advance current Joint Ore Reserve Committee JORC compliant report, substantially increasing resources reporting to indicated and measured confidence levels and completing its preliminary Feasibility Study, among other important project milestones it is working to achieve. 
 
 LIHIR Gold Project: 
 The exploration license for the Lihir Gold Project covers a subsea area that contains several prospective gold exploration targets in two different mineralization types: seamount-related epithermal and modern placer gold. Two subaqueous debris fields within the area are adjacent to the terrestrial Ladolam Gold Mine and are believed to have originated from the same volcanogenic source. The resource lies 500-2,000 meters deep in the Papua New Guinea Exclusive Economic Zone off the coast of Lihir Island, adjacent to the location of one of the world s largest known terrestrial gold deposits. We have an 85.6 interest in Bismarck Mining Corporation, Ltd, the Papua New Guinea company that holds the exploration license (the Bismarck Exploration License for the project. 
 Previous exploration expeditions in the license area, including research conducted by Odyssey, indicate it is highly prospective for commercially viable gold content. 
 In November 2023, Papua New Guinea issued a permit extension allowing Odyssey to continue with our exploration program. We have developed an exploration program for the Lihir Gold Project to validate and quantify the precious and base metal content of the prospective resource. The Company has met with local regulatory authorities, specialists in local mining, environmental legal experts, and logistics support service companies in Papua New Guinea to establish baseline business functions essential for a successful program to support upcoming marine exploration operations in the license area. This offshore work began in late 2021 and is ongoing. Bismarck and Odyssey value the environment and respect the interests and people of Papua New Guinea and Lihir and are committed to transparent sharing of all environmental data collected during the exploration program. 
 27 

During 2023, Odyssey continued exploration in the exploration license area to continue to validate the geological prospectivity of the property. In addition to examining the regional geological and tectonic settings of the region, additional multibeam data and 127 geological samples were collected, and seven ROV dives were conducted. These activities increased Bismarck s confidence in the presence of enriched mineral targets within the exploration license area. Likewise, two target sites were identified for future resource sampling. Future exploration will focus on continued sampling in these locations while working towards a defined resource assessment and gathering environmental baseline data to compile an environmental impact assessment. 
 During the exploration phase, steps to validate and quantify the precious and base metal content of the prospective resource would also be carried out. Once completed, if the data shows extraction can be carried out responsibly, Odyssey will apply for a mining license. 
 Further development of this project is dependent on the characterization resources during the exploration phase.

Revenue 
 
 The revenue generated in each period was a result of performing marine research and project administration services for our customers and related parties. Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.21 million, an increase of 38,000 as compared to 0.18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We do not consider the fluctuation period over period to be significant. 
 
 One company to which we provided these services in both years is a deep-sea mineral exploration company, CIC, which we consider to be a related party because our lead director has an indirect interest in the company (see Note 5, Related Party Transactions ). In addition, during 2024, we also provided services to OML, which is also a related party and that we account for under the equity method of accounting. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Marketing, general and administrative expenses primarily include all costs within the following departments: Executive, Finance Accounting, Legal, Information Technology, Human Resources, Marketing Communications, Sales and Business Development. Marketing, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.7 million, an increase of 0.2 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 0.4 million of increased professional services fees for audit and consulting, offset by a decrease of 0.2 million in stock-based compensation. 
 
 Operations and research expenses are primarily focused around deep-sea mineral exploration, which include minerals research, scientific services, marine operations and project management. Operations and research expenses increased by 0.3 million to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 0.3 million of increased licenses and permits and 0.2 million of increased depreciation and other operating expenses, offset by a decrease of 0.2 million in compensation expenses. 
 
 Total Other Income/Expense 
 
 Total other income/expense was an income of 19.1 million and an expense of 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in a net income increase of 22.7 million. The increased income was attributable to: (i) 21.4 million increase in the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, relating primarily to the change in fair value of warrants; (ii) 0.4 million of other income from our residual economic interest from our legacy shipwreck business, (iii) 0.3 million increased foreign exchange income, and (iv) an increase of 0.4 million in the gain from our equity investment, which were offset by (x) a 0.2 million reduction of the gain on sale of wholly owned entity. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Due to losses and our net operating loss carryforwards, we did not accrue any taxes in either period ending 2024 or 2023. 
 
 29 

Non-Controlling Interest 
 
 Starting in 2013, we became the controlling stockholder of Oceanica. Our financial statements thus include the financial results of Oceanica and its subsidiary, ExO. Except for intercompany transactions that are fully eliminated upon consolidation, Oceanica s revenues and expenses, in their entirety, are shown in our condensed consolidated financial statements. The share of Oceanica s net losses corresponding to the equity of Oceanica not owned by us is subsequently shown as the Non-Controlling Interest in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The non-controlling interest adjustment in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.5 million as compared to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The substance of these amounts is primarily due to the increase in costs relating to permits and other standard operating costs. We do not consider the fluctuation period over period to be significant.

 One company to which we provided these services in both periods is a deep-sea mineral exploration company, CIC, which we consider to be a related party because our lead director has an interest in the company (see Note 5, Related Party Transactions ). In addition, during the nine months ended 2024, we also provided services to OML, which is also a related party and that we account for under the equity method of accounting. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Marketing, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 8.0 million, an increase of 2.8 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from an increase of 2.0 million in professional services primarily attributable to audit and consulting fees and an increase of 1.2 million in non-cash share-based compensation expense, offset by a 0.4 million reduction in employee compensation. 
 
 Operations and research expenses decreased by 0.3 million to 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.6 million the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a 0.3 million decrease in professional legal fees services, 0.2 million decrease in compensation expenses, and 0.1 million decrease in depreciation expense, offset by an increase of 0.3 million in licenses and permits. 
 
 Total Other Income and Expense 
 
 Total other income/expense was 24.0 million and 14.9 million in net income for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in a net increase of 9.1 million. 
 
 The increased income was attributable to: (i) 20.0 million increased gain in the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, relating primarily to the change in fair value of warrants and Litigation financing liability, (ii) 9.8 million of other income from our residual economic interest from our legacy shipwreck business, and (iii) 2.5 million increased foreign exchange income, which were offset by (x) 21.2 million of gain on debt extinguishment in 2023 that did not reoccur in 2024, (y) 1.7 million increase in interest expense which includes debt discount amortization; and (z) 0.3 million in decreased interest income.

March 2023 Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement 
 
 On March 6, 2023, Odyssey entered into a Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the March 2023 Note Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor pursuant to which Odyssey issued and sold to the investor (a) a promissory note (the March 2023 Note in the principal amount of up to 14.0 million and (b) a warrant (the March 2023 Warrants and, together with the March 2023 Note, the Securities to purchase shares of our Common Stock. 
 
 On January 30, 2024, the March 2023 Warrants were amended to add a cashless exercise provision. Due to that amendment, the Company determined that the March 2023 Warrants meet the definition of a derivative and are not considered indexed to the Company s own stock due to the settlement adjustment that provides that the share price input upon cashless exercise is always based on the highest of three prices. As such, the March 2023 Warrants are now recognized as a derivative liability, which was initially measured at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings in the period incurred. 
 
 The amended March 2023 Warrants were measured using the Black-Scholes valuation method on January 30, 2024, and re-classified from equity to warrant liability. The difference between the warrant liability and the initial equity balance was recognized as an additional discount to additional paid-in capital APIC ). The change in fair value of the March 2023 Warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a decrease of 5.9 million and a decrease of 6.2 million, respectively, which has been recorded in the change in derivative liabilities fair value in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of the March 2023 Warrants at September 30, 2024 was 1.5 million. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 0.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively, of interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount and 12,157 and 16,447, respectively, interest from the fee amortization which has been recorded in interest expense on the condensed consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 1.7 million and 1.4 million, respectively, of interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount and 44,693 and 37,363, respectively, interest from the fee amortization which has been recorded in interest expense on the condensed consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 
 The September 30, 2024 carrying value of the debt was 12.7 million, which includes interest Paid-In-Kind PIK of 1.7 million. The total face value of this obligation on September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was 12.7 million and 14.9 million, respectively. 
 
 32 

On September 5, 2024, the Company entered into amendments of the March 2023 Note with the holders thereof pursuant to which the maturity date of the March 2023 Note was extended from September 6, 2024 to December 6, 2024. In connection with the amendments, the Company repaid an aggregate amount of 3.0 million of the principal outstanding on September 6, 2024. 
 
 December 2023 Notes and Warrant Purchase Agreement 
 
 On December 1, 2023, we entered into a Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the December 2023 Note Purchase Agreement with institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold to the investors (a) a series of promissory notes (the December 2023 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to 6.0 million and (b) two tranches of warrants (the December 2023 Warrants and, together with the December 2023 Notes, the December 2023 Securities to purchase shares of our Common Stock. 
 
 The Company determined that the December 2023 Warrants meet the definition of a derivative and are not considered indexed to the Company s own stock due to the settlement adjustment that provides that the share price input upon cashless exercise is always based on the highest of three prices. As such, the December 2023 Warrants were recognized as derivative liabilities and were initially measured at fair value with subsequent gains or losses due to changes in fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 The Company noted that when debt is issued with liability-classified stock purchase warrants, the residual method should be used so that the warrants are recognized at fair value at issuance and the residual proceeds are allocated to the debt. We incurred 65,500 in related expenses, which are being amortized over the term of the December 2023 Note Purchase Agreement and charged to interest expense. The total proceeds of 6.0 million were allocated between debt and warrant liability by recognizing the warrants at their full fair value and allocating the residual proceeds to the December 2023 Notes. The initial fair value of the December 2023 Warrants was 2.4 million, resulting in a corresponding discount on the December 2023 Notes which is being amortized over the remaining term of the December 2023 Note Purchase Agreement using the effective interest method, which is charged to interest expense. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 0.4 million and 1.2 million, respectively, of interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount and 10,996 and 32,750, respectively, of interest from the fee amortization. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the debt was 5.3 million and was net of unamortized debt fees of 29,045, net of unamortized debt discount of 1.1 million associated with the fair value of the warrants. The change in fair value of the December 2023 Warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a decrease of 2.7 million and a decrease of 1.7 million, respectively, which has been recorded in the change in derivative liabilities fair value in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The total face value of this obligation at September 30, 2024 was 6.4 million. The current interest rate of the December 2023 Notes was 11.0 . 
 
 37North 
 
 On June 29, 2023, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement Note Agreement with 37North SPV 11, LLC 37N pursuant to which 37N agreed to loan us 1.0 million. The proceeds from this transaction were received in full on June 29, 2023. Pursuant to the Note Agreement, the indebtedness was non-interest bearing and matured on July 30, 2023. At any time from 31 days after the maturity date, 37N has the option to convert all or a portion of the outstanding amount of the indebtedness into conversion shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) 120 of the amount of the indebtedness, by (B) the lower of 3.66 or 70 of the 10-day volume-weighted average principal VWAP market trading price of Common Stock. The aggregate maximum number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in connection with conversion of the indebtedness is not to exceed (i) 19.9 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock prior to the date of the Agreement, (ii) 19.9 of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities, or (iii) such number of shares of Common Stock that would violate the applicable listing rules of the Principal Market if the stockholders did not approve the issuance of Common Stock upon conversion of the indebtedness. 
 
 Any time prior to maturity, the Company had the option to prepay the indebtedness at an amount of 108 of the unpaid principal. From the maturity date to 29 days after the maturity date (August 27, 2023), we were permitted to repay all (but not less than) of an amount equal to 112.5 of the unpaid amount of the indebtedness. At any time after the 30th day after the maturity date (August 28, 2023), we are permitted to repay all (but not less than) of an amount equal to 115 of the unpaid amount of the indebtedness after 10 days notice. If 37N delivers an exercise notice during this 10-day period, the note issued pursuant to the Note Agreement (the 37N Note would be converted to shares of Common Stock, instead of being repaid. As of September 30, 2024, we have not repaid this Note Agreement. 
 
 33 

If 37N delivers an exercise notice and the number of shares issuable is limited by the 19.9 limitation outlined above, then we are permitted to repay all the remaining unpaid amount of the Loan in an amount equal to 130 of the remaining unpaid amount. On December 27, 2023, 37N delivered an exercise notice to us pursuant to which it exercised its right to convert 360,003 of the outstanding indebtedness under the Note Agreement into shares of our Common Stock. In accordance with the Note Agreement, based on the applicable conversation rate of 2.3226 under the agreement, we issued 155,000 shares of our Common Stock to 37N on December 29, 2023. 
 
 In June 2024, 37N delivered an exercise notice to us pursuant to which it exercised its right to convert 200,701 of the outstanding indebtedness under the Note Agreement into shares of our Common Stock. In accordance with the Note Agreement, based on the applicable conversation rate of 3.6491, we issued 55,000 shares of our Common Stock to 37N on June 24, 2024. 
 
 In July 2024, 37N delivered an exercise notice to us pursuant to which it exercised its right to convert 101,621 of the outstanding indebtedness under the Note Agreement into shares of our Common Stock. In accordance with the Note Agreement, based on the applicable conversation rate of 3.2781, we issued 31,000 shares of our Common Stock to 37N on July 18, 2024. 
 
 In September 2024, 37N delivered an exercise notice to us pursuant to which it exercised its right to convert 250,633 of the outstanding indebtedness under the Note Agreement into shares of our Common Stock. In accordance with the Note Agreement, based on the applicable conversation rate of 2.8161, we issued 89,000 shares of our Common Stock to 37N on September 12, 2024. 
 
 In October 2024, 37N delivered exercise notices to us pursuant to which it exercised its right to convert the remainder of the outstanding indebtedness under the Note Agreement, amounting to 467,043, into shares of our Common Stock. In accordance with the Note Agreement, based on the applicable conversation rates of ranging between 0.41055 and 0.6993, we issued 853,671 shares of our Common Stock to 37N during October 2024. 
 
 We evaluated the indebtedness and, based on the criteria of ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and 815 Derivatives and Hedging, the 37N convertible note is classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet with a share settled redemption feature that is recorded as an embedded derivative. As a result, the share settled redemption and conversion features were recorded at fair value at each reporting period outstanding with changes recognized through Interest expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. The Company analyzed the conversion feature of the note and determined that, because it includes a conditional obligation to issue a variable number of shares based on a fixed amount known at inception, the debt is properly classified as a liability in the balance sheet. The Company identified seven embedded features, all of which were of de minimis fair value other than the Share Settled Redemption Feature. As such, only that was bifurcated and accounted for separately from the debt host. Certain default put provisions were not considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt host, but management concluded that the value of these default put provisions was de minimis. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the debt instrument and embedded derivatives were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value of 0.4 million and 0.1 million, respectively, under Loans payable short term and Litigation financing and other long term. 
 
 At December 31, 2023, the debt instrument and embedded derivatives were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value of 0.8 million and 0.7 million, respectively, under Loans payable short term and Litigation financing and other long term. 
 
 Going Concern Consideration 
 
 We have experienced several years of net losses and may continue to do so. Our ability to generate net income or positive cash flows for the following twelve months is dependent upon financings, our success in developing and monetizing our interests in mineral exploration entities, generating income from contracted services, and collecting amounts owed to us. 
 
 Our 2024 business plan requires us to generate new cash inflows to effectively allow us to perform our planned projects. We continually plan to generate new cash inflows through the monetization of our receivables and equity stakes in seabed mineral companies, financings, syndications or other partnership opportunities. If cash inflow becomes insufficient to meet our desired projected business plan requirements, we would be required to follow a contingency business plan based on curtailed expenses and fewer cash requirements. 
 
 In 2024, we received a payment of approximately 9.8 million arising from a residual economic interest in a salvaged shipwreck. The balance of those proceeds, together with other anticipated cash inflows, is expected to provide sufficient operating funds through at least the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 34 

Our consolidated non-restricted cash balance at September 30, 2024 was 2.9 million. We have a working capital deficit at September 30, 2024 of 27.7 million. The total consolidated book value of our assets was approximately 21.8 million at September 30, 2024, which includes cash of 2.9 million. The fair market value of these assets may differ from their net carrying book value. The factors noted above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023. 
 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 

ITEM 3. QUANTI TATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. We do not believe we have material market risk exposure and have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments to mitigate these risks or for trading or speculative purposes. 
 We currently do not have any debt obligations with variable interest rates. 
 
 ITEM 4. CON TROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedure 
 Disclosure controls are procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Comprehensive Form 10-K, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and principal financial officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO, who is currently also acting as our CFO for this purpose, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, as the result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below, which is currently being remediated. 
 Notwithstanding the material weakness, management believes the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented in this report in conformity with US GAAP. 
 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 In connection with our evaluation for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, that continued during the period ended September 30, 2024, relating to the appropriate review of accounting positions for certain significant transactions. Specifically, (a) the Company does not have sufficient resources with the adequate technical skills to identify and evaluate specific accounting positions and conclusions, and (b) the Company has inadequate processes and controls to ensure appropriate level of precision of review related to our financial statement footnote disclosures. 
 35 

The material weakness did not result in any material misstatement in our interim financial statements or disclosures as set forth in this report, and there were no changes required to any of our previously released interim or audited consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weakness 
 Management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the identified material weakness, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has taken actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting by (a) engaging an Interim Controller with responsibility for monitoring the performance of controls by control owners, (b) continuing our evaluation of the skills and experience of our existing personnel with respect to public company experience and appropriate level of expertise in the respective areas of accounting, SEC financial reporting and associated internal controls commensurate with the type, volume and complexity of our accounting operations, transactions and reporting requirements, and (c) engaging accounting advisory consultants to provide additional depth and breadth in our SEC financial reporting and technical accounting functions, which consultants we expect to continue to utilize until we have ensured that our internal personnel have the appropriate expertise and experience. In addition, we have reinforced the importance of adherence to Company policies regarding control performance and related documentation with control owners, identified training and resource needs for control owners, and developed monitoring activities to validate the performance of controls by control owners. 
 The Company anticipates the actions described above and resulting improvements in controls will strengthen the Company s processes, procedures and controls related to management s review of accounting positions for our transactions and will address the related material weakness. However, the material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable control has operated for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the control is operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the ongoing remediation efforts of the material weakness described above, there were no changes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company may be subject to a variety of claims or suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. We are not a party to any litigation as a defendant where a loss contingency is required to be reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Ris k Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes to our principal risks that we believe are material to our business, results of operations and financial condition, from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Investors should consider such risk factors prior to making an investment decision with respect to the Company s securities.
