 of its total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit and credit-related instruments issued by corporate issuers (including loans, notes, bonds and other corporate debt securities). Private credit investments will principally rank senior in terms of liquidation priority and will mainly take the form of directly originated first lien, stretch senior and unitranche loans, along with some second lien loans, as well as broadly syndicated loans, club deals (generally investments made by a small group of investment firms) and other debt and equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies, including equity co-investments, although the actual mix of instruments pursued will vary over time depending on the Fund s views on how best to optimize risk-adjusted returns. The Fund s investment strategy will also target a minority liquid allocation to primarily broadly syndicated loans and corporate high yield bonds. The Fund intends to use these investments to facilitate the immediate deployment of investors capital subscriptions, to provide liquidity for its share repurchase program in the normal course, and to contribute to investment returns and income generation. When market conditions create compelling return opportunities, the Fund may also invest on an opportunistic basis in a variety of publicly traded credit securities, subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least of assets in eligible portfolio companies. The Fund is offering on a continuous basis up to billion of its common shares of beneficial interest Common Shares pursuant to an offering registered with the SEC (the Offering ). The Fund is offering to sell any combination of three classes of Common Shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, and Class I shares, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different ongoing distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees. The purchase price per share for each class of Common Shares equals the net asset value NAV per share as of the effective date of the monthly share purchase date. The Offering is a best efforts offering, which means that AllianceBernstein Investments, Inc., the Fund s managing dealer (the Managing Dealer for the Offering, will use its best efforts to sell shares, but it is not obligated to purchase or sell any specific amount of shares in the Offering.

The amount payable equals: of cumulative realized capital gains attributable to the applicable share class from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

 Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee by the applicable share class for all prior periods. The Fund accrues, but does not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Fund were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, including Section 205 thereof. For purposes of computing the Fund s incentive fee on income and the incentive fee on capital gains, the calculation methodology looks through derivative financial instruments or swaps as if the Fund owned the reference assets directly. The fees that are payable under the Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund incurred capital gain incentive fees of and , respectively.

 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Fund, its current and prospective portfolio investments, its industry, its beliefs and opinions, and its assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the Fund s control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 	an economic downturn could impair the Fund s portfolio companies ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of the Fund s investments in such portfolio companies; 
 	such an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies that the Fund intends to target for investment, potentially causing the Fund to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies; 
 	a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair the Fund s lending and investment activities; 
 	interest rate volatility could adversely affect the Fund s results, particularly if the Fund elects to use leverage as part of its investment strategy. 
 	the Fund s future operating results; 
 	the Fund s business prospects and the prospects of the Fund s portfolio companies; 
 	the Fund s contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 	the ability of the Fund s portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 
 	competition with other entities and the Fund s affiliates for investment opportunities;

 	the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of the Fund s investments; 
 	the adequacy of the Fund s financing sources and working capital; 
 	the loss of key personnel; 
 	the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of the Fund s portfolio companies; 
 	the ability of the Adviser and AB High Yield (as defined below) to locate suitable investments for the Fund and to monitor and administer the Fund s investments; 
 	the ability of the Adviser and AB High Yield to attract and retain highly talented professionals;

 Although the Fund believes that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by the Fund that the Fund s plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in the section entitled Risk Factors in the Prospectus, and elsewhere in this report.

excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act because the Fund is an investment company. 
 The following analysis of the Fund s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Fund s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Overview 
 
 The Fund is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). Formed as a Delaware statutory trust on June 8, 2023, the Fund is externally managed by AB Private Credit Investors LLC (the Adviser or AB-PCI ), which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Adviser is registered as investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). We also intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. 
 Under the Fund s Advisory Agreement (as defined below), the Fund has agreed to pay the Adviser an annual management fee as well as an incentive fee based on its investment performance. Also, under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), the Fund has agreed to reimburse the Adviser (in its capacity as administrator, the Administrator for the allocable portion of expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. The Fund also will be liable to reimburse the Administrator for the Fund s allocable portion of compensation of the Administrator s personnel, including but not limited to the compensation and related expenses of the Fund s chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs. The Administrator may defer or waive rights to be reimbursed for the costs and expenses noted above including the Fund s allocable portion of compensation of the Administrator s personnel. The Administrator will not charge the Fund any fees for its services as Administrator. AB-PCI and AB High Yield (as defined below) are both affiliates and subsidiaries of AllianceBernstein L.P. AB 
 The Fund s investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, predominantly in the form of current income, with select investments exhibiting the ability to capture long-term capital appreciation. The portfolio is expected to consist primarily of directly originated, privately negotiated corporate loans to borrowers in the US middle market, typically involving a private equity backed issuer, and in more limited instances, venture capital supported or independently owned issuers. The Fund seeks to additionally invest in broadly syndicated loans and bonds from private and public issuers to facilitate the immediate deployment of investors capital subscriptions, maintain liquidity requirements, and for opportunistic purposes. 
 The Fund s investment strategy focuses on directly originated, privately negotiated senior secured credit investments in primarily U.S.-based middle market companies. The Fund will primarily invest in businesses with enterprise values of 200.0 million to 2.0 billion and/or EBITDA between 10.0 million and 75.0 million, at the time of investment. The enterprise value of a company is defined as equity value, plus debt, less cash and is calculated based on a range of valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows, publicly traded comparable company analysis, and comparable transactions analysis. Calculations of EBITDA may be subject to various adjustments deemed appropriate by AB-PCI. Examples include, but are not limited to, non-cash expenses, non-recurring expenses, expected synergies or cost reductions, run-rate impact of new locations or assets, and acquisition or disposition related adjustments. The Fund may invest in larger or smaller companies if they operate in a sector where AB-PCI has expertise and/or exhibit credit characteristics consistent with our investment process, and where we believe an attractive relative risk-adjusted return can be generated for investors. 
 
 The Fund is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act JOBS Act ). For so long as the Fund remains an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, the Fund will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. The Fund expects to remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: 
 
 the last day of the Fund s fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary occurs of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; 

the end of the fiscal year in which the Fund s total annual gross revenues first equal or exceed 1.235 billion; 

the date on which the Fund has, during the prior three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and 

the last day of a fiscal year in which the Fund (1) has an aggregate worldwide market value of shares of its common stock held by non-affiliates of 700.0 million or more, computed at the end of each fiscal year as of the last business day of the Fund s most recently completed second fiscal quarter and (2) has been an Exchange Act reporting company for at least one year (and filed at least one annual report under the Exchange Act). 

35 

Under the JOBS Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), the Fund is exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that the Fund s independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, until such time as the Fund ceases to be an emerging growth company and becomes an accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. This may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the Fund s internal control over 
 financial reporting go undetected . 
 
 Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Fund intends to take advantage of the extended transition period. 
 Initial Portfolio 
 On May 1, 2024, shortly prior to our election to be regulated as a BDC, and in order to avoid the blind pool-aspects typically associated with the launch of a new fund, the Fund acquired from Equitable Financial Life Insurance Company, an affiliated insurance company owned by Equitable Holdings, Inc. (the Seller ), a select portfolio of directly originated, privately negotiated corporate loans to borrowers in the U.S. middle market (the Initial Portfolio ). The Fund issued 4,400,000 Class I shares at 25.00 per share and used 171.3 million of 178.0 million total borrowings under the Scotia Credit Facility (as defined below), to purchase the Initial Portfolio from the Seller for an aggregate purchase price of 281.3 million. The Fund purchased the Initial Portfolio pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement and a Subscription Agreement by and between us and the Seller. 
 
 The Initial Portfolio is comprised of performing U.S. dollar-denominated private credit investments that the Fund believes exhibit attractive risk-adjusted returns, diversification and qualities consistent with those prioritized by AB-PCI during the investment process. The investments and unfunded obligations in the Initial Portfolio are consistent with the Fund s investment objectives, investment strategy and the investment requirements set forth under the 1940 Act and were selected using the same origination standards and selective investment approach that the Adviser intends to employ for the Fund going forward. 
 Investments 
 Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80 of its total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit and credit-related instruments issued by corporate issuers (including loans, notes, bonds and other corporate debt securities). If the Fund changes its 80 test, it will provide shareholders with at least 60 days prior notice of such change. The Fund s level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, trading prices of loans and other securities and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 The Fund plans to generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. The Fund s senior and subordinated debt investments are expected to bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of the Fund s investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, the Fund may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. The Fund will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 
 Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser and AB (in its capacity as sub-adviser of the Fund, AB HighYield ), when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser, as applicable. We will bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (a) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, dated August 7, 2024, between the Fund and the Adviser (the Advisory Agreement ), and to AB High Yield, pursuant to 
 36 

the Sub-Advisory Agreement, dated August 7, 2024, between the Adviser and AB High Yield; (b) the costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, dated August 7, 2024, by and between the Fund and the Administrator. We also will be liable to reimburse the Administrator for the Fund s allocable portion of compensation of the Administrator s personnel, including but not limited to: (i) the Fund s chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs; (ii) investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals at the Administrator that perform duties for the Fund; and (iii) any internal audit group personnel of AB-PCI or any of its affiliates. The Administrator may defer or waive rights to be reimbursed for the costs and expenses noted above including the Fund s allocable portion of compensation of the Administrator s personnel; and (c) all other expenses of our operations, administrations and transactions. 
 
 From time to time, AB-PCI (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator), AB High Yield or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse AB-PCI (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator), AB High Yield or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, AB-PCI (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator) and AB High Yield may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders, subject to the cap on organization and offering expenses described in Item 1. Financial Statements-Notes to Financial Statements-Note 3. Related Party Transactions . 
 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 
 We have entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with our Adviser. For additional information, see Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statement Note 3 Related Party Transactions Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement .

Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. The Fund may make exceptions to this treatment if an investment has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

The Adviser monitors the Fund s portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of the Fund s investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to the Fund s other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; 

attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and 

review of monthly and quarterly consolidated financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund had 35,589 and 412,450, respectively, in net change in unrealized appreciation on 267,403,193 of investments in 73 portfolio companies. Net change in unrealized appreciation for the period for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments on level 3 securities. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from June 8, 2023 (Inception) to September 30, 2023 the Fund did not incur any unrealized appreciation or deprecation. 
 
 Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 3,587,653 and 6,495,550, respectively . Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund s per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 0.82 and 1.48 respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from June 8, 2023 (Inception) to September 30, 2023 there was no change in net assets. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash increased by 18,856,594. During the same period, cash used in operating activities was 145,157,821, primarily as a result of net purchases of investments. The Fund provided 164,014,415 from financing 
 40 

activities, primarily from net borrowings on the Credit Facilities and issuance of Common Shares. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from June 8, 2023 (Inception) to September 30, 2023 the Fund did not have any cash flows. 
 Hedging 
 The Fund may enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and/or other derivative arrangements to hedge against interest rate, currency, and/or other credit related risks through the use of futures, options and forward contracts. These hedging activities will be subject to the applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements; however, there can be no assurance any hedging strategy employed will be successful. The Fund may also seek to borrow capital in local currency as a means to hedging non-U.S. dollar denominated investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the period from June 8, 2023 (inception) to September30, 2023 the Fund did not enter into any hedging contracts. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Fund had 18,856,594 and 0 in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. The Fund expects to generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of the Offering, (ii) cash flows from the Fund s operations, (iii) any financing arrangements now existing or that the Fund may enter into in the future and (iv) any future offerings of the Fund s equity or debt securities. The Fund intends to sell its shares on a continuous monthly basis at a per share price equal to the then-current NAV per share. 
 The Fund s primary uses of cash will be for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying AB-PCI (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator) or AB High Yield), (iii) cost of any borrowings or other financing arrangements and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our Common Shares. 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, taken together with the Fund s 82,500,000 undrawn amount on its Credit Facilities, is expected to be sufficient for the Fund s investing activities and to conduct the Fund s operations for at least the next twelve months. 
 A deterioration in economic conditions or any other negative economic developments could restrict our access to financing in the future. We may not be able to find new financing for future investments or liquidity needs and, even if we are able to obtain such financing, such financing may not be on as favorable terms as we have previously obtained. These factors may limit our ability to make new investments and adversely impact our results of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Fund has unfunded commitments to fund future investments in the amount of 23,278,849 and contractual obligations in the form of Credit Facilities of 167,500,000. 
 Equity Activity 
 The Fund can offer up to 1,000,000,000 of Common Shares in the Offering on a best efforts basis through AllianceBernstein Investments, Inc., the Managing Dealer, a registered broker-dealer. 
 
 On April 30, 2024, AB contributed 10,000 of capital to the Fund. In exchange for this contribution, AB received 400 Shares at 25 per Share. 
 
 On May 1, 2024, the Fund issued 4,400,000 Class I Shares at 25.00 per share. The Fund redeemed all of the Common Shares issued to AB and repaid AB 10,000. 
 
 During September 2024, the Fund issued 34,393 Class I Shares at 25.00 per share. 
 There was no other equity activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Co-Investment Relief 
 
 The Fund may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with its affiliates without prior approval of the trustees who are not interested persons, and in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. The Fund, the Adviser and certain of their affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC for the Fund to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with the Fund s investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, the Fund generally is permitted to 
 41 

co-invest with certain of its affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board makes certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching of the Fund or its shareholders by another participant in the co-investment transaction, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Fund s shareholders and is consistent with its investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by its affiliates would not disadvantage the Fund, and the Fund s participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which its affiliates are investing and (4) the proposed investment by the Fund would not benefit the Adviser or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the exemptive relief and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. As a result of exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in the Fund s investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the exemptive relief and that have an investment objective similar to the Fund s. 
 Borrowings 
 Scotia Credit Facility 
 On May 2, 2024, the Fund entered into a Senior Secured Credit Agreement with The Bank of Nova Scotia, as the administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time (the Scotia Credit Facility ). 
 The Scotia Credit Facility will be guaranteed by certain of the Fund s domestic subsidiaries that are formed or acquired by the Fund in the future (collectively, the Guarantors ). Proceeds of the Scotia Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments. 
 
 The Scotia Credit Facility provides for a revolving credit facility in an initial amount of up to 75,000,000, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on the Fund s portfolio investments and other outstanding indebtedness. Maximum capacity under Scotia Credit Facility may be increased to 400,000,000 through the exercise by the Fund of an uncommitted accordion feature through which existing and new lenders may, at their option, agree to provide additional financing. The Scotia Credit Facility also provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of 25,000,000. The Scotia Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments held by the Fund and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions, and includes a 15,000,000 sublimit for swingline loans. 
 
 The availability period with respect to the revolving credit facility under the Scotia Credit Facility will terminate on May 2, 2028 (the Commitment Termination Date and the Scotia Credit Facility will mature on May 2, 2029 (the Maturity Date ). During the period from the Commitment Termination Date to the Maturity Date, the Fund will be obligated to make mandatory prepayments under the Scotia Credit Facility out of the proceeds of certain asset sales and other recovery events and equity and debt issuances. 
 
 The Fund may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Amounts drawn under the Scotia Credit Facility in U.S. dollars will bear interest at either (i) term SOFR plus a margin of 2.150 per annum, or (ii) the alternate base rate plus a margin of 1.150 per annum. The Fund may elect either the term SOFR or alternate base rate at the time of drawdown, and loans denominated in U.S. dollars may be converted from one rate to another at any time at the Fund s option, subject to certain conditions. Amounts drawn under the Scotia Credit Facility in other permitted currencies will bear interest at the relevant rate specified therein plus an applicable margin (including any applicable credit spread adjustment). The Fund will also pay a fee of 0.375 on daily undrawn amounts under the Scotia Credit Facility. 
 
 The Scotia Credit Facility includes customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence by the Fund of additional indebtedness and on the Fund s ability to make distributions to its shareholders, or redeem, repurchase or retire Common Shares, upon the occurrence of certain events and certain financial covenants related to asset coverage and liquidity and other maintenance covenants, as well as customary events of default. 
 ABPLF Credit Facility 
 
 On May 2, 2024, ABPLF entered into a Credit Agreement with ABPLF as borrower, the Adviser, as collateral manager, the lenders from time to time parties thereto, The Bank of Nova Scotia, as administrative agent, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as collateral administrator and collateral agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as custodian (the ABPLF Credit Facility and, together with the Scotia Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities ). The ABPLF Credit Facility provides for a total 
 42 

commitment amount of up to 200,000,000, which is split between the Class A-R Loans and the Swingline Loans, on a revolving basis, and in the case of the Class A-T Loans, on a term basis. The total Class A-R commitment as of the closing date is 25,000,000 and will increase automatically to (x) 50,000,000 on the two-month anniversary of the closing date and (y) 100,000,000 on the eight-month anniversary of the closing date. The total Class A-T commitment as of the closing date is 100,000,000. Amounts drawn under the ABPLF Credit Facility, will bear interest at either the Term SOFR Reference Rate, or the weighted average of the Commercial Paper Rate, the Liquidity Funding Rate and the Credit Funding Rate (each as defined in the ABPLF Credit Agreement, the Applicable Rate ), in each case, plus a margin. Advances used to finance the purchase or origination of any eligible loans under the ABPLF Credit Facility initially bear interest at the Applicable Rate plus a spread of 2.50 . After the expiration of a two-year reinvestment period, the applicable margin on outstanding advances will be increased by 0.50 per annum. The availability period with respect to the revolving commitments under the ABPLF Credit Facility will terminate on May 2, 2026. 
 
 The ABPLF Credit Facility is secured by ABPLF s right, title and interest in the pledged collateral, which includes (but is not limited to): all collateral loans; the custodial accounts, the eligible accounts, and the eligible investments; cash, money, securities, reserves and other property of ABPLF; all related property; and certain agreements entered into in connection with the ABPLF Credit Facility. The stated maturity date of the ABPLF Credit Facility is May 2, 2033. 
 
 The ABPLF Credit Facility includes customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence by ABPLF of additional indebtedness, as well as customary events of default. 
 Asset Coverage 
 
 The Fund is permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to its common shares if its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would a t least equal 150 immediately after each such issuance. On July 23, 2024, the Fund s sole shareholder approved the adoption of this 150 threshold pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and such election became effective the following day. As defined in the 1940 Act, asset coverage of 150 for preferred shares means that for every 100 of net assets t he Fund holds, it may raise 200 from borrowing and issuing senior securities representing stock. Asset coverage of 150 for indebtedness means that for every 100 of net assets the Fund holds, it may raise 200 from borrowing. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, the Fund will be required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to the Fund s shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless it meets the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. The Fund will also be permitted to borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of its total assets for temporary or emergency purposes, which borrowings would not be considered senior securities. Leverage embedded or inherent in derivative instruments in which the Fund may invest are not subject to such asset coverage requirements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Fund had an aggregate principal amount of 167,500,000 of borrowings under the Credit Facilities and had an asset coverage ratio of 166 . 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Valuation of Investments 
 
 The Fund measures the value of its investments at fair value accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 
 Pursuant to the amended SEC Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, the Board designated the Adviser as the Fund s valuation designee. In this capacity, the Adviser is responsible, among other things, for making all fair value determinations relating to the Fund s portfolio investments, subject to the Board s oversight. Investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, as valuation designee, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation under a valuation policy. The Adviser principally carries out its fair value responsibilities through its Valuation Sub-Committee. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter. 
 
 The audit committee of the Board (the Audit Committee is also responsible for assisting the Adviser, as valuation designee in valuing investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. Investments for which 
 43 

market quotations are readily available are valued using market quotations, which are generally obtained from independent pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers. With respect to portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Adviser, as valuation designee and its senior investment team and independent valuation firms, is responsible for determining in good faith the fair value in accordance with the valuation policy approved by the Board. If more than one valuation method is used to measure fair value, the results are evaluated and weighted, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. The Fund considers a range of fair values based upon the valuation techniques utilized and selects the value within that range that was most representative of fair value based on current market conditions as well as other factors the Adviser s senior investment team considers relevant. 
 
 ASC Topic 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. ASC Topic 820 also provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings and provides for enhanced disclosures determined by the level within the hierarchy of information used in the valuation. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, these inputs are summarized in the three levels listed below: 
 44 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical investments. 
 	Level 2 Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.). 
 	Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments at the reporting date). 
 
 The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. If a fair value measurement uses price data vendors or observable market price quotations, that measurement is a Level 2 measurement. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. 
 
 The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgment by the Fund. The Fund considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market. 
 
 Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation for all fair value investments and interests, the Board s determination of fair value may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed, or that could have been (or will be) realized in an actual sale, and such differences could be material. 
 
 The value of any investment on any valuation date is intended to represent the fair value of such investment on such date based upon the amount at which the investment could be exchanged between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation sale, and reflects the Board s determination of fair value using the methodology described herein. Any valuation of an investment may not reflect the actual amount received by the Fund upon the liquidation of such investment. 
 
 The Fund s investments will be primarily loans made to middle-market companies. These investments are mostly considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is not usually a known or accessible market or market indices for these types of debt instruments and, thus, the Adviser s senior investment team must estimate the fair value of these investment securities based on models utilizing unobservable inputs. 
 Management and Incentive Fees 
 
 The Fund will accrue for the base management fee and incentive fee. The accrual for the incentive fee includes the recognition of the incentive fee on unrealized capital gains, even though such incentive fee is neither earned nor payable to the Adviser until the gains are both realized and in excess of unrealized depreciation on investments. The amount of capital gains incentive fee expense related to the hypothetical liquidation of the portfolio (and assuming no other changes in realized or unrealized gains and losses) would only become payable to the Adviser in the event of a complete liquidation of the Fund s portfolio as of period end and the termination of the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement on such date. Also, it should be noted that the capital gains incentive fee expense fluctuates with the Fund s overall investment results. 
 Federal Income Taxes 
 
 The Fund intends to be to be treated, and to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Generally, a RIC is not subject to federal income taxes on distributed income and gains if it distributes at least 90 of its net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of its net long-term capital losses, if any, to its shareholders. The Fund intends to distribute sufficient dividends to maintain its RIC status each year and the Fund does not anticipate paying any material federal income taxes in the future. 
 45 

Item 3. Quantitative an d Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The Fund is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. To the extent that the Fund borrows money to make investments, the Fund s net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which the Fund borrows funds and the rate at which the Fund invests these funds. In periods of rising interest rates, the Fund s cost of funds would increase, which may reduce the Fund s net investment income. Because the Fund expects that most of its investments will bear interest at floating rates, the Fund anticipates that an increase in interest rates would have a corresponding increase in the Fund s interest income that would eventually offset any increase in the Fund s cost of funds and, thus, net investment income would not be reduced significantly. The timing of interest rate resets on the Fund s investments and the Fund s debt may differ leading to a temporary increase or decrease in net investment income. However, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have an adverse effect on the Fund s net investment income. In addition, U.S. and global capital markets and credit markets have experienced a higher level of stress due to rising inflation, which has resulted in an increase in the level of volatility across such markets and a general decline in the value of the securities held by the Fund. 
 
 The Fund will primarily invest in illiquid debt securities of private companies. Because the Fund expects that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in the Fund s portfolio, the Fund expects to value many of its portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Fund s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 
 
 In connection with rising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have increased interest rates. A prolonged increase in interest rates could results in an increase in the Fund s non-performing assets and a decrease in the value of its portfolio because the portfolio companies paying interest at such increasing floating rates may be unable to meet higher payment obligations. In periods of rising interest rates, the Fund s cost of funds would increase, which, if not matched with the rising interest rates of its performing floating-rate assets, could result in a decrease in its net investment income. Incurring additional leverage will magnify the impact of an increase to the Fund s cost of funds. A decrease in interest rates may reduce net income, because new investments may be made at lower rates despite the increased demand for the Fund s capital that the decrease in interest rates may produce. 
 
 In addition, although the Fund does not currently intend to make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent it does, the Fund will be subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved. 
 
 The Fund may hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate the Fund against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit the Fund s ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the Fund s portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 
 
 Assuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024, were to remain constant and that the Fund took no actions to alter its existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates.
