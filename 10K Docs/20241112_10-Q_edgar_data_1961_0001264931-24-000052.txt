and a stockholder s deficiency of and used of cash
in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and
implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable
to continue as a going concern. 

Management believes that the actions presently being
taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern,
although no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful.

the Company does not expect it will ever have to repay those notes. 

options and warrants outstanding and
as of September 30, 2023, there were options and warrants outstanding whose effect is anti-dilutive and not included in
diluted net loss per share for September 30, 2024 or for September 30, 2023. The options and warrants may dilute future earnings per share.

The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value: 

Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available. 

The carrying amounts of the Company s financial
assets and liabilities, such as cash, other receivables, accounts payable accrued expenses, due to related party, notes payable
and notes payables, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company's convertible notes
payable are measured at amortized cost. 

Warrant and option expense was measured by using level

 Forward Looking Statements 

When used in this Form 10-Q and in other filings by
the Company with the Commission, the words or phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate,"
"expect," "intend," hope , "may," "plan," "predict," "project,"
"will" or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, each
of which speak only as of the date made. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. The Company has no obligation to publicly
release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events
or circumstances occurring after the date of such statements. 

These forward-looking statements involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different. These factors include, but are
not limited to, changes that may occur to general economic and business conditions resulting from changes in political, social and economic
conditions (whether or not related to terrorism, war, pandemic, weather, environmental or other factors) in the jurisdictions in which
we operate and changes to regulations that pertain to our operations. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with the unaudited financial statements and related notes which are included under Item 1. 

We do not undertake to update our forward-looking
statements or risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances. 

Overview 

General 

On May 16, 2011, we transferred, through a
spin-off to our then wholly owned subsidiary, Worlds Online Inc. (currently named MariMed Inc.), the majority of our operations and
related operational assets. We retained our patent portfolio. We also entered into a License Agreement with MariMed Inc. to
sublicense patented technologies, which agreement has since expired. 

At present, the Company s anticipated sources
of revenue will be from any revenue that may be generated from monetizing our collection of non-fungible tokens and our legacy celebrity
virtual reality worlds and from other applications of our technology that we may develop. We are also exploring options to acquire an
operating business. No assurance can be given that we will generate material revenues from these efforts or that we will be successful
in acquiring an operating business. 

Worlds has been running the Worlds Chat platform continuously
since 1996. It is generally recognized as the first and longest running 3D virtual platform. 

Upon registration, Worlds members are able to access
over 200 virtual worlds and customize their avatars with company developed clothing and characters. 

The Company offers an upgraded VIP service for 2 per month.
There are over 200,00 registered users in the Worlds database. There are currently, on average, 10,000 monthly users accessing the Worlds
chat service. 

14 

 Table of Contents 

The Worlds platform utilizes software tools that allow the individual
users to create their own custom worlds and invite other Worlds users to visit their custom-built world. The user s custom worlds
are hosted on the user s own servers but most authentic their access through the Worlds authentication servers. 

The company has been porting the Worlds Chat service to the
Amazon Cloud (AWS) over the past 3 months. 

Concurrent with the porting the company has been developing
under third party contract a new upgraded platform and expects to launch the new service in Q1 2025. 

Revenues 

We generated no revenue during the quarter. 

Expenses 

We classify our expenses into two broad groups: 

Cost of revenues; and 

selling, general and administration. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have had to limit our operations since mid- 2001
due to a lack of liquidity. However, we were able to issue equity and convertible debt in the last few years and raise small
amounts of capital from time to time that, prior to the spinoff, was used to enable us to begin upgrading our technology, develop new
products and actively solicit additional business, and more recently to protect, increase and enforce our patent portfolio. 

Although we have been able to generate funds through
our sale of shares of MariMed Inc., we continue to pursue additional sources of capital though we have no current arrangements with respect
to, or sources of, additional financing at this time and there can be no assurance that any such financing will become available. If we
cannot raise additional capital, form an alliance of some nature with another entity, raise more funds through the sale of shares of MariMed
Inc., or start to generate sufficient revenues, we may be unable to purchase additional patents or otherwise expand operations through
acquisition or otherwise. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Revenue was 0 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. Since the termination of our patent infringement lawsuits, the Company s sources of revenue are anticipated
to be from monetizing our collection of non-fungible tokens from our legacy celebrity virtual reality worlds. We still need to raise
a sufficient amount of capital to provide the resources required that would enable us to expand our business. 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to three months ended September 30, 2023 

Selling general and administrative (SG A)
expenses increased by 45,708 to 61,971 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 16,263 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase is due to an increase in data center costs and the cost of a consultant for advisory services in the capacity
of finding investors to invest in the Company. 

15 

 Table of Contents 

Salaries and related increased by 11,302 to 65,128
from 53,826 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The CEO s salary is based on the terms of his
2018 employment agreement and he is the Company s only salaried employee. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 the
Company had interest expense of 19,127. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had interest expense of 20,632. 

As a result of the foregoing, we realized a net loss
of 146,226 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 90,721 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
nine months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue is 0 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. All the operations were transferred over to Worlds Online Inc. in the spin off. The business up to the spin off continued
to run in a severely diminished mode due to the lack of liquidity. Post spin off we still need to raise a sufficient amount of capital
to provide the resources required that would enable us to continue running the business. 

Cost of revenues is 0 in the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. 

Selling general and administrative (SG A)
expenses increased by 50,093 from 72,665 to 122,758 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The increase
is due to an increase in data center costs and the cost of a consultant for advisory services in the capacity of finding investors to
invest in the Company. 

Salaries and related increased by 32,666 to 194,426
from 161,760 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The CEO s salary is based on the terms of his
2018 employment agreement and he is the Company s only salaried employee. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the
Company had interest expense of 56,784. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had interest expense of 58,262. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the
Company had a gain on sale of marketable securities of 76,839. The Company did not sell any securities in the nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

As a result of the foregoing, we realized a net loss
of 373,968 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 215,848 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents
were 31,253. The Company was unable to raise funds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company used 213,604 in cash
to pay for operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

At September 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents
were 31,088. The Company raised funds by selling shares of stock that the Company retained in the spin off company MariMed Inc. during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company raised 76,839 from selling shares of MariMed Inc. common stock. The Company used
 80,529 in cash to pay for operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Historically, primary cash requirements have been
used to fund the cost of operations and lawsuits, and patent enforcement, with additional funds having been used in connection with the
exploration of new business lines.

 Table of Contents 

We hope to raise additional funds to be used for further
expansion of our legacy celebrity worlds and collection of non-fungible tokens. No assurances can be given that we will be able to
raise any additional funds. 

Item 4. Controls And Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the quarter covered by this report there were
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
