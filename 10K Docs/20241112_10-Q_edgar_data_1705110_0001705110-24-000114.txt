 million as a discrete item in the third quarter because we are now forecasting the utilization of these net operating losses within the foreseeable future. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax benefit, despite pre-tax income, due primarily to the valuation allowance release mentioned above and research credits, partially offset by tax shortfalls generated by the vesting of stock-based awards. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of million and million, respectively, which represents an effective income tax rate of and , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate of 21 due primarily to benefits related to a change in the annual expected effective income tax rate, and a reconciliation of income tax provision accruals to tax returns and research credits, partially offset by tax shortfalls generated by the vesting of stock-based awards. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effective income tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of 21 due primarily to the impact of stock-based awards, partially offset by research credits. 
 The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. Accruals for interest are not material and there are currently no accruals for penalties. 
 The Company s income taxes are routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities as a result of previously filed separate company and consolidated tax returns with IAC. These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. The Company is not currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Returns filed in various other jurisdictions are open to examination for tax years beginning with 2014. Income taxes payable include unrecognized tax benefits that are considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from the examination of prior year tax returns. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes and, therefore, may require periodic adjustment. Although management currently believes changes in unrecognized tax benefits from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, of million and million, respectively; all of which are for tax positions included in IAC s consolidated tax return filings. If unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 are subsequently recognized, the income tax provision would be reduced by million. The comparable amount as of December 31, 2023 is million. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by million by September 30, 2025 due to settlements; all of which would reduce the income tax provision. 
 The Company regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets considering all available evidence including, to the extent applicable, the nature, frequency and severity of prior cumulative losses, forecasts of future taxable income, tax filing status, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, available tax planning and historical experience. At September 30, 2024, the Company has a U.S. gross deferred tax asset of million that the Company expects to fully utilize on a more likely than not basis. Of this amount, million will be utilized upon the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the remaining net deferred tax asset of million will be utilized based on forecasts of future taxable income. The Company s most significant net deferred tax asset that could expire relates to U.S. federal net operating loss NOL carryforwards of million. The Company expects to generate sufficient future taxable income of at least million prior to the expiration of these NOLs, the majority of which expire between 2033 and 2037, to fully realize this deferred tax asset.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Ads and Leads revenue decreased 50.8 million, or 17 , due primarily to a decrease in consumer connection revenue of 51.7 million, or 25 , and a decrease in membership subscription revenue of 2.7 million, or 21 , partially offset by an increase of 3.7 million, or 5 , in advertising revenue. The decrease in consumer connection revenue was driven by ongoing user-experience enhancements as well as lower sales and marketing spend, resulting in both lower Service Requests and lower acquisition of new professionals. The decrease in membership subscription revenue was primarily due to a decrease in professionals in the Angi network. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to an increase in advertising sold through our sales force. 
 Services revenue decreased 6.3 million, or 21 , due primarily to a lower amount of Service Requests as a result of certain efforts described in Ads and Leads above. 
 International revenue increased 2.5 million, or 9 , due primarily to a larger professional network and higher revenue per professional. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Ads and Leads revenue decreased 129.9 million, or 15 , due primarily to a decrease in consumer connection revenue of 145.5 million, or 23 , and a decrease in membership subscription revenue of 6.1 million, or 15 , partially offset by an increase of 21.9 million, or 10 , in advertising revenue.

 Ads and Leads Adjusted EBITDA increased 32.2 million, or 32 , to 132.4 million, and increased as a percentage of revenue, driven by lower selling and marketing expense due to improved marketing efficiency and lower general and administrative expense due to the decrease in the provision for credit losses and lower legal fees, partially offset by lower gross profit due to a decrease in revenue, and an increase in lease expense. 
 Services Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.8 million, or 91 , to 5.9 million, and increased as a percentage of revenue, driven by lower compensation costs and other operating expenses. 
 International Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.2 million, or 38 , to 15.5 million, and increased as a percentage of revenue, driven by an increase in revenue and continued operating expense leverage.

 In 2024, the Company recorded a benefit, despite pre-tax income, due primarily to the valuation allowance release for foreign net operating losses and research credits, partially offset by tax shortfalls generated by the vesting of stock-based awards. Following the purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interests of a foreign subsidiary, we reorganized related business operations, which resulted in the release of a valuation allowance for foreign net operating losses in the amount of 31.1 million as a discrete item in the third quarter because we are now forecasting the utilization of these net operating losses within the foreseeable future. 
 In 2023, the Company recorded a benefit due primarily to benefits related to a change in the annual expected effective income tax rate, and a reconciliation of income tax provision accruals to tax returns and research credits, partially offset by tax shortfalls generated by the vesting of stock-based awards.

 PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 We report Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). This measure is considered our primary segment measure of profitability and one of the metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, and on which our internal budgets are based and may also impact management compensation. We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below. 
 Definition of Non-GAAP Measure 
 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations because it excludes the impact of these expenses. 
 
 The following table reconciles net earnings (loss) attributable to Angi Inc. shareholders to operating income (loss) to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA:

 For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company s reportable segments, see Note 5 Segment Information to the financial statements included in Item 1 Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 
 Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded from Our Non-GAAP Measure 
 Stock-based compensation expense consists of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions, of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units RSUs ), stock options, performance-based RSUs PSUs and market-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash and we view the economic costs of stock-based awards to be the dilution to our share base; we also include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding for GAAP earnings per share using the treasury stock method. PSUs and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period). The Company is currently settling all stock-based awards on a net basis and remits the required tax-withholding amounts from its current funds.

 Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our capitalized software, leasehold improvements and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter. 
 Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as professional relationships, technology, and trade names, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairments of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.

 Cash Flow Information 
 In summary, the Company s cash flows are as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities attributable to continuing operations 115,904 85,241 Investing activities attributable to continuing operations (37,541) (35,956) Financing activities attributable to continuing operations (47,544) (8,234) 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities attributable to continuing operations consists of earnings adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital. Non-cash adjustments include depreciation, provision for credit losses, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense (including impairment of right-of-use assets), deferred income taxes, and amortization of intangibles. 
 2024 
 Adjustments to net earnings attributable to continuing operations consist primarily of 65.7 million of depreciation, 43.7 million of provision for credit losses, 28.1 million of stock-based compensation expense, 13.8 million of non-cash lease expense (including impairment of right-of-use assets), and 24.6 million of deferred income taxes. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase of 44.7 million in accounts receivable, a decrease of 13.9 million in operating lease liabilities and a decrease of 3.9 million in accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by a decrease of 21.1 million in other assets. The increase in accounts receivable is due primarily to timing of cash receipts. The decrease in operating lease liabilities is due to cash payments on leases net of interest accretion. The decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities is due primarily to the timing of payments, partially offset by an increase in accrued advertising. The decrease in other assets is due primarily to payment received related to insurance coverage for previously incurred legal fees and a decrease in prepaid hosting services. 
 Net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations includes capital expenditures of 37.5 million primarily related to investments in capitalized software to support the Company s products and services. 
 Net cash used in financing activities attributable to continuing operations includes 25.7 million for the repurchase of 11.4 million shares of the Company s Class A common stock, on a settlement date basis, at an average price of 2.25 per share, 
 37 

Table of Conten t s 

 16.0 million for the purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interests of a foreign subsidiary, and 5.7 million for the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for stock-based awards that were net settled. 
 
 2023 
 Adjustments to net loss attributable to continuing operations consist primarily of 69.7 million of depreciation, 64.8 million of provision for credit losses, 33.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, 9.1 million of non-cash lease expense, and 8.0 million of amortization of intangibles. The decrease from changes in working capital consists primarily of an increase of 58.5 million in accounts receivable, a decrease of 16.5 million in operating lease liabilities, and an increase of 18.8 million in accounts payable and other liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable is due primarily to timing of cash receipts. The decrease in operating lease liabilities is due to cash payments on leases net of interest accretion. The increase in accounts payable and other liabilities is due, in part, to timing of payments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations includes capital expenditures of 36.1 million primarily related to investments in capitalized software to support the Company s products and services and purchases of marketable debt securities of 12.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable debt securities of 12.5 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities attributable to continuing operations includes 4.8 million for the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for stock-based awards that were net settled and 3.4 million for the repurchase of 1.1 million shares of the Company s Class A common stock, on a settlement date basis, at an average price of 3.22 per share. 
 
 Discontinued Operations 
 Net cash provided by discontinued operations of 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 relates to the operations of THR. The Company does not expect cash flows from discontinued operations following the sale of THR. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Share Repurchase Authorizations and Activity 
 Du ring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 11.4 million shares of its Class A common stock, on a trade date basis, at an average price of 2.25 per share, or 25.6 million in aggregate. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company announced its intent to repurchase the 14.0 million shares remaining in its stock repurchase authorization from March 2020 (the 2020 Share Authorization ). On August 2, 2024, the board of directors of the Company approved a new stock repurchase authorization of 25 million shares (the 2024 Share Authorization ). As of August 19, 2024, the Company had no shares remaining under the 2020 Authorization. From October 1, 2024 through November 8, 2024 the Company repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares at an average price of 2.49 per share, or 2.8 million in aggregate. As of November 8, 2024, the Company had 23.1 million shares remaining in the 2024 Share Authorization. 
 The Company may repurchase shares pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Authorization over an indefinite period of time in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors the Company s management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 At September 30, 2024, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the Company's contractual obligations disclosures as of December 31, 2023, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The Company s 2024 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2023 capital expenditures of 47.8 million by approximately 10 to 15 , due to an increase related to capitalized software. 
 Liquidity Assessment 
 The Company s liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for its products and services due to economic or other factors.

Table of Conten t s 

 At September 30, 2024, IAC held 2.6 million of the Company s outstanding Class A shares and all of the Company s outstanding Class B shares, which represented 85.3 of the Company s economic interest and 98.3 of the Company s voting interest as of that date. As a result, IAC has the ability to control the Company s financing activities, including the issuance of additional debt and equity securities by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or the incurrence of other indebtedness generally. While the Company is expected to have the ability to access debt and equity markets if needed, such transactions may require the approval of IAC due to its control of the majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company s capital stock and its representation on the Company s board of directors. 
 The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments, for the next twelve months. We may elect to raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or debt financing to fund business activities such as strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, or other purposes beyond the next twelve months. 
 Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all, and may also be impacted by any disruptions in the financial markets. In addition, the Company s existing indebtedness could limit its ability to obtain additional financing.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), management, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. 
 The Company monitors and evaluates on an ongoing basis its internal control over financial reporting in order to improve its overall effectiveness. In the course of these evaluations, the Company modifies and refines its internal processes as conditions warrant. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II 
 OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Overview 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are (or may become) parties to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving property, personal injury, intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, competition, commercial disputes, consumer protection and other claims, as well as stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. 
 Rules of the Commission require the description of material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary, routine litigation incident to the registrant s business) and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not exceeding 10 of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In the judgment of Company management, none of the pending litigation matters which we are defending, including the matter described below, involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude. The matter described below involves issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders, regardless of whether it may be material to our financial position or operations based upon the standard set forth in the rules of the Commission. 
 Professional Class Action Litigation against HomeAdvisor 
 In July 2016, a putative class action, Airquip, Inc. et al. v. HomeAdvisor, Inc. et al. , No. 1:16-cv-1849, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaint, as amended in November 2016, alleged that HomeAdvisor engages in certain deceptive practices affecting the professionals who join its network, including charging them for substandard customer leads and failing to disclose certain charges. The complaint sought certification of a nationwide class consisting of all HomeAdvisor professionals since October 2012, asserted claims for fraud, breach of implied contract, unjust enrichment and violation of the federal RICO statute and the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, and sought injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount. 
 In July 2018, plaintiffs counsel filed a separate putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, Costello et al. v. HomeAdvisor, Inc. et al. , No. 1:18-cv-1802, on behalf of the nine professionals also proposed as new plaintiffs in the Airquip case, naming as defendants HomeAdvisor, the Company and IAC (as well as an unrelated company), and asserting 45 claims largely duplicative of those asserted in a proposed second amended complaint in the Airquip case. In November 2018, the judge presiding over the Airquip case issued an order consolidating the two cases to proceed before him under the caption In re HomeAdvisor, Inc. Litigation . 
 In September 2019, the court issued an order granting the plaintiffs renewed motion for leave to file a consolidated second amended complaint, naming as defendants, in addition to HomeAdvisor, the Company and IAC, CraftJack, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) and two unrelated entities. In October and December 2019, the four defendants affiliated with HomeAdvisor filed motions to dismiss certain claims in the amended complaint. In September 2020, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the defendants motions to dismiss. 
 In May 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification; the defendants opposed the motion. On January 10, 2024, the court issued an order largely denying the motion; while the court certified certain classes seeking only injunctive relief based upon alleged misappropriation of professional s intellectual property, the court declined to certify any of the proposed classes challenging lead quality and seeking monetary relief. On July 18, 2024, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiffs petition for leave to appeal the district court s partial denial of class certification. On August 20, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a second motion for class certification, proposing somewhat narrower, state-based classes; the defendants opposed the motion, which remains pending. 
 On February 26, 2024, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the plaintiffs claims alleging misappropriation of professional s intellectual property. On September 13, 2024, the district court issued an order granting the defendants motion and dismissing the plaintiffs misappropriation claims.
