Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ). Any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future
events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically
identified by words such as plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, 
 outlook, estimate, forecast, project, continue, could, 
 may, might, possible, potential, predict, should, 
 would and other similar words and expressions, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

The
forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of our management and are inherently subject to uncertainties and changes
in circumstances and their potential effects and speak only as of the date such statements are made. These forward-looking statements
involve a number of risks, uncertainties or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different
from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those
described in Risk Factors in the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1, filed with the SEC on October 11,
2023 and Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 thereto filed on November 13, 2023 and December 18, 2023, respectively. 

These
and other factors could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date hereof. There can be no assurance that future developments will be those
that have been anticipated or that we will achieve or realize these plans, intentions, or expectations. 

All
forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing
cautionary statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 

In
addition, statements of belief and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are
based upon information available to us as of the date they are made, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for
such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted
an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain,
and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

shares of Estrella s Series AA Preferred Stock (the Separation ). 

As
part of the Separation, Estrella entered into a License Agreement (the License Agreement with Eureka and Eureka Therapeutics
(Cayman) Ltd. Eureka Cayman ), an affiliate of Eureka, and a Services Agreement (the Services Agreement with Eureka, and Eureka contributed and assigned the Collaboration Agreement between Eureka and Imugene Limited Imugene (the Collaboration Agreement to Estrella. The License Agreement grants the Company an exclusive license to develop CD19
and CD22 targeted T-cell therapies using Eureka s ARTEMIS platform. Under the Services Agreement, Eureka has
agreed to perform certain services for the Company in connection with the development of the Company s product candidates, EB103
and EB104. EB103, which is a T-cell therapy also called CD19-Redirected ARTEMIS T-Cell Therapy, utilizes
Eureka s ARTEMIS technology to target CD19. The Company is also developing EB104, a T-cell therapy also called
 CD19/22 Dual-Targeting ARTEMIS T-Cell Therapy. Like EB103, EB104 utilizes Eureka s ARTEMIS technology
to target not only CD19, but also CD22. The Collaboration Agreement establishes the partnership between the Company and Imugene related
to development of solid tumor treatments using Imugene s product candidate CF33-CD19t in conjunction with EB103. 

On
March 2, 2023, the FDA cleared Estrella s IND application for EB103, allowing Estrella to proceed with the Phase I/II STARLIGHT-1
Clinical Trial STARLIGHT-1 . On March 4, 2024, the Company, Estrella and Eureka executed Statement of Work #001 relating
to clinical trial services to be performed by Eureka in connection with the STARLIGHT-1 clinical trial (see Note 9). On May 13, 2024,
the Company and Eureka entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Statement of Work, effective as of March 4, 2024 (see Note 9). As of September
30, 2024, the Company is continuing to enroll patients into the STARLIGHT-1 clinical trial in the U.S. 

5 

million, and accumulated deficit of approximately million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, loss from operations
was approximately million. The Company s ability to fund its operations is dependent on the amount of cash on hand and its
ability to raise debt or additional equity financing. The Company has expended substantial funds on its research and development business,
has experienced losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and expects losses and negative cash flows from operations
to continue until its technology receives regulatory approval and the Company generates sufficient revenue and positive cash flow from
operations, if ever. 

On
September 29, 2023, the Business Combination and several concurrent financing transactions were consummated, with the Company receiving
net proceeds of approximately million, after deducting million payable to redeem shares of UPTD Common Stock at 
per share in connection with the special meeting of UPTD stockholders related to the Business Combination held on July 31, 2023, 
million for UPTD s transaction expenses and million for repayment of working capital loans, consisting of: (i) million
from the issuance of shares of the Company s Operating Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the closing of the Business
Combination million of which was comprised of funds in the trust account delivered to the Company at the closing of the Business
Combination that would have otherwise been paid to US Tiger Securities, Inc. as a deferred underwriting fee in connection with UPTD s
IPO); (ii) million from the issuance of an unsecured promissory note by us to a third party investor; (iii) million from the
funds held in UPTD s trust account; and (iv) million from the PIPE investors pursuant to the Subscription Agreements. 

On
April 20, 2023, UPTD entered into the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and the White Lion RRA with White Lion. Subsequently, on April
26, 2023, UPTD and White Lion entered into an amendment to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase
Agreement, following the Closing, New Estrella will have the right, but not the obligation, to require White Lion to purchase, from time
to time up to in aggregate gross purchase price of newly issued shares of Common Stock (the Equity Line Shares ),
subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement as further described in Note 8. 

On
October 10, 2023, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the Business Combination to pay million due to Eureka under
the Services Agreement and approximately million aggregate amount due to Eureka under the License Agreement, comprised of the outstanding
portion of the upfront fee as well as a milestone payment in connection with the submission of the IND application for EB103. The Company
intends to devote the remaining net proceeds from the Business Combination to the preclinical and clinical development of the Company s
product candidates and the public company compliance costs. 

6 

million for achievement of all milestones. As of September 30, 2024, Estrella has paid million to Eureka
for covering the fees associated with the milestones that have been achieved. In addition, the Company has made a deposit of million
towards patient treatment expenses, which will be applied to the final invoice, with unused portion of this deposit to be refunded once
all expenses are fully settled. 

On
May 13, 2024, the Company and Eureka entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Statement of Work, effective as of March 4, 2024, to clarify
that in the event that Estrella exercises its right to terminate or suspend the engagement with Eureka by providing written notice to
Eureka in accordance with the SOW, Estrella will only be obligated to compensate Eureka for (i) services provided by Eureka pursuant
to the SOW Services in connection with milestones that were achieved prior to the date and time of such written notice,
(ii) reasonable and documented pass-through costs incurred by Eureka on behalf of Estrella prior to the date and time of such written
notice in connection with providing the Services and (iii) amounts payable to third parties pursuant to commitments reasonably entered
into by Eureka on behalf of Estrella prior to the date and time of such written notice in connection with providing the Services, provided
that Eureka shall make commercially reasonable efforts to cancel or reduce any such amounts. 

The
Company s future operations are highly dependent on a combination of factors, including but not necessarily limited to (1) the
success of our research and development programs; (2) the timely and successful completion of any additional financing; (3) the
development of competitive therapies by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies; (4) our ability to manage growth of the
organization; (5) our ability to protect our technology and products; and, ultimately (6) regulatory approval and successful
commercialization and market acceptance of our product candidates. 

However,
management believes that the Company has sufficient funds on hand and ability to raise funds in the future through the issuance and sale
of Equity Line Shares to White Lion in order to meet its working capital requirements and debt obligations, for at least the next 12
months from the filing date of these unaudited condensed financial statements.

in the United States. Of these balances, approximately million and million, respectively, were not covered by deposit insurance.
While management believes that these financial institutions are of high credit quality, it also continually monitors their creditworthiness.

was determined to be the accounting acquirer given that Estrella effectively controlled the Company upon consummation of the Business
Combination. The transaction is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, which is equivalent to the issuance of Common Stock by Estrella
for the net monetary assets of UPTD, accompanied by a recapitalization. Estrella was determined as the accounting acquirer and the historical
financial statements of Estrella became the Company s historical financial statements, with retrospective adjustments to give effect
of the reverse recapitalization. The net assets of UPTD were recognized as of the Closing Date at historical cost, with no goodwill or
other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Closing Date are those of Estrella and Estrella s operations are the
only ongoing operations of the Company.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Unless
the context otherwise requires, for purposes of this section, the terms Company, we, us, our, 
refer to Immunopharma, Inc. collectively with its subsidiary Estrella Biopharma, Inc., while the term Estrella refers to
Estrella Biopharma, Inc. prior to closing of the business combination (the Business Combination with TradeUP Acquisition
Corp. UPTD on September 29, 2023. The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition
should be read together with our unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this
Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 (the Annual Report filed with the SEC. Certain
information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). 

Overview 

The
Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing T-cell therapies with the capacity to address treatment challenges for
patients with blood cancers and solid tumors. We believe T-cell therapy continues to represent a revolutionary step towards providing
a potential solution for many forms of cancer, including cancers poorly addressed by current approaches. 

On
June 28, 2022, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Eureka contributed certain assets related to T-cell therapies targeting CD19 and/or
CD22 to Estrella in exchange for 105,000,000 shares of Series AA Preferred Stock of Estrella (the Separation ). Eureka determined
that the Separation would allow for the flexibility to create a capital structure tailored to Estrella s strategic goals, provide
increased access to capital markets, allow for greater focus on the product candidates contributed to Estrella, and result in a dedicated
management team. 

As
part of the Separation, Estrella entered into a License Agreement with Eureka and Eureka Therapeutics (Cayman) Ltd., an affiliate of
Eureka, and a Services Agreement with Eureka, and Eureka contributed and assigned the Collaboration Agreement between Eureka and Imugene
to Estrella. The License Agreement grants Estrella an exclusive license to develop CD19 and CD22-targeted T-cell therapies using Eureka s
ARTEMIS platform. Under the Services Agreement, Eureka has agreed to perform certain services for us in connection
with the development of our product candidates, EB103 and EB104, and researching the use of EB103 in conjunction with CF33-CD19t. The
Collaboration Agreement establishes our collaboration with Imugene related to the development of solid tumor treatments using CF33-CD19t
in conjunction with EB103. 

On
March 2, 2023, the FDA cleared the IND application for EB103, allowing Estrella to proceed with the Phase I/II STARLIGHT-1 Clinical Trial. 

On
March 4, 2024, Estrella and Eureka entered into Statement of Work No. 001 SOW relating to the clinical trial services
to be performed by Eureka in connection with STARLIGHT-1, the Phase I/II clinical trial of Estrella s product candidate, EB103,
a T-cell therapy targeting CD19 using ARTEMIS T cell technology licensed by Estrella from Eureka. Pursuant to the SOW,
Estrella agrees to pay Eureka non-refundable net fees in connection with the achievement of certain milestones set forth in the SOW,
with total fees of 33.0 million for achievement of all milestones. As of September 30, 2024, Estrella has paid 3.5 million to Eureka
for covering the fees associated with milestones that have been achieved. 

To
date, Estrella has funded its operations primarily from the June 28, 2022 issuance of 5.0 million of our Series A Preferred Stock, and
net proceeds of approximately 20.1 million raised from completion of the Business Combination on September 29, 2023. We have a limited
operating history. Since our inception, our operations have focused on preparing for the Business Combination, regulatory filings (including
the INDs), planning preclinical and clinical studies, and building our management team. We do not have any product candidates approved
for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. 

26 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 22.9 million. We have remitted payment of approximately 11.2
million to Eureka, consisting of the upfront payment incurred under the License Agreement and monthly service provided by Eureka under
the Services Agreement on October 10, 2023. In addition, in March 2024, we have paid 3.5 million to Eureka for covering the fees associated
with the milestones achieved. In June 2024, we has made a deposit of 1.5 million towards patient treatment expenses, which will be applied
to the final invoice, with unused portion of this deposit will be refunded once all expenses are fully settled. 

We
anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: 

continue to advance preclinical
 and clinical development of our product candidates and preclinical programs; 

seek regulatory approval
 for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

scale up our clinical and
 regulatory capabilities; 

adapt our regulatory compliance
 efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products; 

maintain, expand, and protect
 our intellectual property portfolio; 

add operational, financial
 and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization
 efforts; and 

incur additional legal,
 accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.

Company at the closing of the Business Combination that would have otherwise been paid to US Tiger Securities, Inc as a deferred underwriting
fee in connection with UPTD s initial public offering), which shares were converted to shares of Estrella Common Stock and subsequently
exchanged for Merger Consideration Shares of UPTD immediately prior to the effective time of the merger at an exchange ratio of 0.2407,
with such shares becoming shares of New Estrella Common Stock from and after the effective time of the Merger; (ii) issuance of 500,000
shares of Estrella s Series A Preferred Stock to White Lion for 500,000 and 250,000 shares of Estrella Series A Preferred Stock
to White Lion in consideration for its commitments under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, dated April 20, 2023, between UPTD and
White Lion and in accordance with the Joinder to the Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement between Estrella and White Lion, dated
April 20, 2023, which shares were subsequently converted to shares of Estrella Common Stock and exchanged for Merger Consideration Shares
of UPTD at an exchange ratio of 0.2407, with such Merger Consideration Shares becoming shares of New Estrella Common Stock from and after
the effective time of the Merger and (iii) issued an unsecured promissory note to a third party for 300,000 at 12 interest per annum,
which will be payable 30 days after the closing date of the Merger of September 29, 2023 and subsequently settled on October 26, 2023.

While
the legal acquirer in the Business Combination was UPTD, for financial accounting and reporting purposes under U.S. GAAP, Estrella was
the accounting acquirer, and the Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. A reverse recapitalization
(i.e., a capital transaction involving the issuance of stock by UPTD for the stock of Estrella) does not result in a new basis of accounting,
and the consolidated financial statements of the combined company represent the continuation of the consolidated financial statements
of Estrella in many respects. Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations of Estrella became the historical
consolidated financial statements of the combined company, and UPTD s assets, liabilities, and results of operations were consolidated
with Estrella beginning on the Closing Date. Operations prior to the Business Combination are presented as those of Estrella. The net
assets of UPTD are recognized at historical cost (which is expected to be consistent with carrying value), with no goodwill or other
intangible assets recorded upon execution of the Business Combination. 

As
a consequence of the Merger, Estrella became the successor to an SEC-registered and Nasdaq-listed company which will require Estrella
to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices.
Estrella expects to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors and officers 
liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting and legal and administrative resources, including
increased audit and legal fees. 

Estrella s
future results of consolidated operations and financial position may not be comparable to historical results as a result of the Business
Combination. 

On
June 26 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Ownership and Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State to effect a merger (the Merger
1 with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Estrella, pursuant to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Merger 1 was
approved by resolutions duly adopted by the unanimous written consent of the Company s board of directors. The Merger 1 became
effective at 11:59 PM Eastern Time on June 30, 2024, at which time the separate existence of Estrella ceased, and the Company became
the surviving corporation. 

Results
of Operations 

Estrella
was formed on March 30, 2022, and has not commenced revenue-producing operations. To date, our operations have consisted of the development
and early-stage testing of our initial product candidates, EB103 and EB104, preparation and submission of the IND Application for and
researching the use of EB103 in conjunction with CF33-CD19t. 

The
results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represented our results of operations to be comparable with the same
period in 2023. 

There
are two major expenses incurred for the operation: 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to conducting work related to IND-enabling, IND-filing and clinical trial
preparation, which were mainly performed by Eureka. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred approximately
 2.8 million and 0.5 million of research and development expenses, respectively. All research and development expense incurred for the
periods presented above were dedicated to the development of ARTEMIS T-cell therapies targeting CD19 and CD22. The
increase in research and development expenses was mainly due to Estrella incurring higher service fees with Eureka due to completion
of two patients dosing under the SOW for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase
was offset by decrease of stock based compensation of approximately 0.5 million as no stock-based compensation was incurred during the
three months ended September 30, 2024. 

28 

Our
breakdown of research and development expenses by categories for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below:

 three months

General
and administrative expense 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we incurred approximately 0.6 million and 1.4 million in general and administrative
expenses, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to extensive professional fees and stock-based compensation incurred upon the consummation
of the Business Combination during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which were not present during the same period in 2024. 

Net Loss 

We
incurred a net loss of approximately 3.4 million and 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase as we continue to work with Eureka to advance the IND filings,
preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and preclinical programs, seek regulatory approval for any product candidates
that successfully complete clinical trials, scale up our clinical and regulatory capabilities, adapt our regulatory compliance efforts
to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products, maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio, add operational,
financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future
commercialization efforts, and incur additional legal, accounting, and other expenses in operating as a public company. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately 1.8 million. Our ability to fund our operations is dependent on the amount of cash
on hand, our ability to raise debt or additional equity financing, and ultimately our ability to generate sufficient revenue. We have
expended substantial funds on research and development, have experienced losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception,
and expect losses and negative cash flows from operations to continue until such time that our product candidates receive regulatory
approval and we generate sufficient revenue and positive cash flow from operations, if ever. 

To
date, we have not generated any revenue from any source, and we do not expect to generate revenue for at least the next few years.
If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or fail to obtain their regulatory approval, our
ability to generate future revenue will be adversely affected. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from our product
candidates, and we do not expect to generate revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our product
candidates. 

We
expect our expenses to increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue research and development,
and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain approval for any of our product candidates, we expect
to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. Furthermore, following
the completion of the Business Combination, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. 

On
September 29, 2023, the Business Combination and several concurrent financing transactions were consummated, with Estrella receiving
net proceeds of approximately 20.1 million, after deducting 5.07 million payable to redeem 467,122 shares of UPTD Common Stock at 10.86
per share in connection with the special meeting of UPTD stockholders related to the Business Combination held on July 31, 2023, 1.6
million for transaction expenses and 0.7 million for repayment of working capital loans, consisting of: (i) 9.75 million from the issuance
of shares of Estrella Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination 0.7 million of which was
comprised of funds in the trust account delivered to Estrella at the closing of the Business Combination that would have otherwise been
paid to US Tiger Securities, Inc. as a deferred underwriting fee in connection with UPTD s IPO); (ii) 0.3 million from the issuance
of an unsecured promissory note by us to a third party investor; (iii) 0.7 million from the funds held in UPTD s trust account;
and (iv) 10 million from the PIPE investors pursuant to the Subscription Agreements. 

29 

On
October 10, 2023, we remitted approximately 9.3 million to Eureka upon consummation of the Business Combination. We expect to devote
the remaining net proceeds from the Business Combination to the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and our
public company compliance costs. Based on our current operating plan, we expect that the net proceeds from the Business Combination and
our ability to raise funds in the future through the issuance and sale of Equity Line Shares to White Lion will allow us to fund our
operating expenses and capital requirements through one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. However, this
estimate is subject to various uncertainties and risks, some of which are beyond our control. We may use our available capital resources
sooner than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our estimate as to how long we expect
such proceeds to be able to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong,
and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond
our control, could result in fewer cash and cash equivalents available to us or cause us to consume capital significantly faster than
we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. 

On
March 4, 2024, the Company and Eureka entered into Statement of Work No. 001 SOW relating to the clinical trial services
to be performed by Eureka in connection with STARLIGHT-1, the Phase I/II clinical trial of Estrella s product candidate, EB103,
a T-cell therapy targeting CD19 using ARTEMIS T cell technology licensed by Estrella from Eureka. Pursuant to the SOW,
Estrella agreed to pay Eureka non-refundable net fees in connection with the achievement of certain milestones set forth in the SOW,
with total fees of 33.0 million for achievement of all milestones. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had expensed approximately
 6.3 million to Eureka for covering the fees associated with the milestones achieved. In addition, we deposited 1.5 million with Eureka
for patient treatment expenses, which will be applied to the final invoice, with any unused portion refunded once all fees are settled. 

On
May 13, 2024, the Company and Eureka entered into Amendment No. 1 to the SOW, effective as of March 4, 2024, to clarify that in the event
that Estrella exercises its right to terminate or suspend the engagement with Eureka by providing written notice to Eureka in accordance
with the SOW, Estrella will only be obligated to compensate Eureka for (i) services provided by Eureka pursuant to the SOW Services in connection with milestones that were achieved prior to the date and time of such written notice, (ii) reasonable and documented pass-through
costs incurred by Eureka on behalf of Estrella prior to the date and time of such written notice in connection with providing the Services
and (iii) amounts payable to third parties pursuant to commitments reasonably entered into by Eureka on behalf of Estrella prior to the
date and time of such written notice in connection with providing the Services, provided that Eureka shall make commercially reasonable
efforts to cancel or reduce any such amounts. 

Our
future operations are highly dependent on a combination of factors, including but not necessarily limited to (1) the success of our research
and development programs; (2) the timely and successful completion of any additional financing; (3) the development of competitive therapies
by other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies; (4) our ability to manage growth of the organization; (5) our ability to protect
our technology and products; and, ultimately (6) regulatory approval and successful commercialization and market acceptance of our product
candidates. 

In
addition, there is no assurance that the Warrant holders will exercise their Warrants because they are currently out of the money. As
of September 30, 2024, the closing price of our Common Stock was 1.16 per share, which is significantly lower than the exercise price
of the Warrants of 11.50 per share. Therefore, it is unlikely that the warrant holders will exercise their warrants unless the market
price of our Common Stock increases substantially above the exercise price. The cash proceeds associated with the exercise of the Warrants
are dependent on the stock price and the number of Warrants being exercised. We cannot predict when or if any Warrants will be exercised,
and it is possible that none or only a small number of Warrants will ever be exercised. Therefore, we may not be able to rely on the
warrant exercise as a source of liquidity or capital resources. 

30 

Furthermore,
although the Common Stock Purchase Agreement with White Lion provides that the Company may, in its discretion, from time to time, direct
White Lion to purchase shares of up to 50.0 million of Common Stock Equity Line Shares from the Company in one or more
purchases in accordance with the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company is not permitted to issue any Equity Line Shares under
the Common Stock Purchase Agreement without obtaining majority stockholder approval if such issuance would equal 20 or more of the Company s
outstanding common stock, which had not been obtained as of the date hereof and may not be obtained in the future. On December 28, 2023,
the Company s registration statement on Form S-1 related to the Equity Line Shares was declared effective. As of the date hereof,
no Equity Line Shares have been issued to White Lion under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. 

We
plan to raise additional capital in the future in order to continue our research and development programs and fund operations. However,
our ability to raise additional capital in the equity or debt markets is dependent on various factors, and there is no assurance that
such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The market demand of our equity is subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including but not limited to, negative economic conditions, adverse market conditions, and adverse financial results. 

Cash Flows 

Operating activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was primarily attributable
to (a) a net loss of approximately 3.4 million, (b) approximately 1.5 million prepaid expense to Eureka for patient treatment expenses,
which will be applied to the final invoice, with any unused portion refunded once all fees are settled, and (c) approximately 0.1 million
increase in prepaid expense as we prepaid various service providers which we expect to be amortized within the next 12 months, offset
by (a) a 57,000 increase in other payables and accrued liabilities, due to additional professional fees accrued during the period, and
(b) approximately 2.7 million increase in accrued liability related party as additional service charges were incurred from Eureka
following the completion of two patients dosing milestone. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily attributable
to a net loss of approximately 1.9 million, offset by approximately 1.6 million increase in non-cash item such as stock-based compensation
as we incurred amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the stock options granted to our employees, board
of directors, and other consultants under the Incentive Plan. 

Investing activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily attributable
approximately 0.1 million loan to UPTD as Monthly Extension Payment before merger. 

Financing activities 

Net
cash used in financing activities was approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was primarily attributable
to approximately 0.2 million payment in stock repurchase. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately 20.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily
attributable to approximately 20.0 million net proceed received from the consummation of the Business Combination, which included approximately
 9.0 million in gross proceeds raised through sales of Estrella Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger, approximately 0.3 million raised through issuance of an unsecured promissory note by Estrella to a third party investor, approximately
 0.7 million proceeds raise from the reverse recapitalization, and 10.0 million net proceeds from the PIPE Investment that closed concurrently
with the consummation of the Business Combination. 

31 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under
the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

Commitments 
Contingencies 

In
the normal course of business, we are subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business,
that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations and tax matters. In accordance with ASC No. 450-20,
 Loss Contingencies , we will record accruals for such loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 

License
Agreement 

Pursuant
to the License Agreement, we were obligated to make (i) a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable payment of 1.0 million, payable in
twelve equal monthly installments, (ii) certain one-time, non refundable, non-creditable development milestone payments
upon the occurrence of certain events related to development and sales, with potential aggregate multi-million dollar payments upon FDA
approval, and (iii) royalty payments of a single digit percentage on net sales during any consecutive 12-month period. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have fully paid the license fee to Eureka. 

As
of September 30, 2024, two development milestones related to the submission of EB103 to the FDA Milestone 1 and first
patient dosed in the first clinical trial of a licensed product Milestone 2 was earned by Eureka under the Agreement.
Milestone payment related to Milestone 1 was accrued by Estrella and paid on October 10, 2023. Milestone payment related to Milestone
2 was accrued by Estrella in July 2024, and the balance was paid on September 3, 2024. 

No
other development milestones, except those mentioned above, sales milestone, or royalty payment has been earned as we do not have any
product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. 

Collaboration
Agreement 

Pursuant
to the Collaboration Agreement, we and Imugene will be separately responsible for all qualified full-time person FTE and other internal costs incurred in the performance of its research, as well as the full cost of procurement of leukopaks and purification
of T-cells from two donors, and of manufacturing and quality control of EB103 T-cells under the research plan. Any joint cost will be
shared equally. If either we or Imugene incurs out-of-pocket costs in excess of the amount budgeted for such costs in the applicable
research budget plus allowable overruns, then the other party will not be responsible for its 50 share of the excess of such budgeted
amount plus allowable overruns, unless the joint steering committee approves such excess costs (either before or after such costs have
been incurred). The research plan under the Collaboration Agreement was completed as of August 30, 2023. 

Services
Agreement 

Pursuant
to the Services Agreement, we agreed to (i) pay Eureka 10.0 million in connection with the services thereunder payable in 12 equal monthly
installments and (ii) reimburse Eureka on a monthly basis for reasonable pass-through costs incurred or paid to providers by Eureka in
providing the services. In addition, we will be charged for other services performed by Eureka outside the scope of the services set
forth in the Services Agreement, at a flat rate, by time or materials or as mutually agreed upon the parties in writing. As of September
30, 2024, we had remitted to Eureka a total of 10,000,000 plus 117,920 of pass-through costs for services provided pursuant to the
Services Agreement. 

Statement
of Work 

Pursuant
to the SOW, Estrella agreed to pay Eureka total fees of 33.0 million in connection with the Phase I/II clinical trial of Estrella s
product candidate, EB103, a T-cell therapy targeting CD19 using ARTEMIS T cell technology licensed by Estrella from Eureka.
As of September 30, 2024, we had paid 3.5 million to Eureka for covering the fees associated with milestones achieved, and deposited
 1.5 million for patient treatment expenses, which will be applied to the final invoice, with any unused portion refunded once all fees
are settled. 

In
addition, two patients dosing milestone has completed during the three month ended September 30, 2024, and the Company has accrued 2.75
million in accrued liabilities related party, for the corresponding dosing milestones. 

32 

Equity
Financing Commitment 

On
April 20, 2023, UPTD entered into a Common Stock purchase agreement (as amended on April 26, 2023 and from time to time, the Common
Stock Purchase Agreement and a related registration rights agreement (the White Lion RRA with White Lion. Pursuant
to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, following the Closing, the Company has the right, but not the obligation to require White Lion
to purchase, from time to time up to 50.0 million in aggregate gross purchase price of newly issued shares of Common Stock of the Company,
subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, including, among others, the initial
and any subsequent registration statement for the Equity Line Shares being declared effective by the SEC and remaining effective during
the term of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. In addition, under Nasdaq listing rules, the Company is not permitted to issue any Equity
Line Shares under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement if such issuance would equal 20 or more of the Company s outstanding common
stock without obtaining majority approval by our stockholders, which had not been obtained as of the date hereof. On December 28, 2023,
the Company s registration statement on Form S-1 related to the Equity Line Shares was declared effective by the SEC. As of the
date hereof, no Equity Line Shares have been issued to White Lion pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. 

Registration
Rights 

The
holders of 312,200 shares of common stock that were issued to the initial stockholders of UPTD (the Founder Shares and
of 1,107,500 shares of Common Stock issued to certain investors in a private placement in connection with UPTD s initial public
offering (the Private Shares are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement, dated July
14, 2021, among UPTD, TradeUP Acquisition Sponsor LLC and certain security holders named therein. The Company assumed the obligations
of UPTD under such agreement upon consummation of the Business Combination. The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled
to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company registers such securities. In addition, the holders have
certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the
initial Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act. We are also obligated to file a registration statement for the (i) Equity Line Shares that we may issue to White Lion
pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and White Lion RRA, (ii) up to 2,225,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of the Warrants and (iii) the shares issued or that will be issued pursuant to the Subscription Agreements. The Company will bear the
expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. The Company filed a registration statement on Form
S-1 with the SEC on October 10, 2023 and subsequently filed Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 thereto on November 13, 2023 and December
18, 2023, respectively, with respect to the Founder Shares, Private Shares, Equity Line Shares, the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrants and certain shares issuable under the Subscription Agreements. The registration statement was declared effective
by the SEC on December 28, 2023. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements
and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We have identified certain accounting
estimates that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These estimates are important for an understanding of
our financial condition and results of operation. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance
to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management s
current judgments. We believe no critical accounting estimate was identified other than below listed significant estimate and accounting
policies. 

33 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
recognize compensation costs resulting from the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, non-employees, and directors as an expense
in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period based on a measurement of fair value for each stock-based
award. The fair value of each option granted is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model,
net of actual forfeitures. The fair value is amortized as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model includes various assumptions, including
the fair market value of Estrella Common Stock, expected life of stock options, the expected volatility, and the expected risk-free interest
rate, among others. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions
generally outside of our control. 

As
a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock-based compensation expense, as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance,
could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if we use different assumptions on future grants, stock-based compensation expense
could be materially affected in future periods. 

We
account for the fair value of equity instruments issued to non-employees using either the fair value of the services received or the
fair value of the equity instrument, whichever is considered more reliable . We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing
model to measure the fair value of options issued to non-employees. 

We
record compensation expense for the awards with graded vesting using the straight-line method. We recognize compensation expense over
the requisite service period applicable to each individual award, which generally equals the vesting term. Forfeitures are recognized
when realized. 

Emerging
Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

In
April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can
take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or
revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards
would otherwise apply to private companies. We previously elected the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards, which delays the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective. 

Management s
Controls Over Financial Reporting 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or
submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not, in design and operation, effective as of September
30, 2024 at a reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below: 

Material
Weaknesses 

We
did not have qualified full-time personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to address complex U.S. GAAP
accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP. 

35 

Significant
deficiency 

We
did not have comprehensive written control policies in place related to complex transactions and revenue recognition, or an internal
audit function to ensure the internal controls are properly designed and implemented. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
Auditing Standard AS 2201, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Following
the identification of the material weakness, we plan to take remedial measures including: 

hiring
 additional qualified accounting personnel with relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience
 and qualifications to strengthen the financial reporting function and to set up a financial
 and system control framework 

establishing
 internal audit function by engaging an external consulting firm to assist us with assessment
 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 compliance requirements and improvement of overall internal
 control 

We
believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
Company is in the process of implementing certain changes in its internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material
weaknesses described above. The implementation of the material aspects of this plan began in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.
Additional qualified personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to address U.S. GAAP accounting issues
have been added to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP. Non-routine transactions are analyzed
by in-house staff and third-party consultants to ensure proper accounting treatment. Narratives and policies for business processes that
relate to financial statements have been put in place to establish proper segregation of duties and internal controls.
