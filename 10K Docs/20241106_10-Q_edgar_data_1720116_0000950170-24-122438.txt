For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and of total revenue was attributable to customers with pricing contracts, respectively, versus and attributable to transactional customers, respectively. Pricing contracts are generally annual contracts or longer, with auto renewal. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers services to the customer, those amounts are classified as deferred revenue. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of deferred revenue was and , respectively, all of which is expected to be realized in the next months. In relation to the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023, and was recognized into revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

The actual timing of recognition may vary due to factors outside of the Company s control. The Company excludes variable consideration related entirely to wholly unsatisfied performance obligations and contracts and recognizes such variable consideration based upon the right to invoice the customer. Sales commissions are incurred and recorded on an ongoing basis over the term of the customer relationship. These costs are recorded in sales and marketing expenses. In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, differing from the U.S. corporate statutory federal income tax rate of . T he difference for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the effect of state income taxes and certain nondeductible permanent differences, partially offset by the utilization of research and development tax credits. The difference for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of release of the valuation allowance, recognition of research and development tax credit, state income taxes and permanent differences. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon its evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, tax benefit has been recognized in the Company s financial statements. The Company continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings. Due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards since inception, all of the Company s income tax filings remain open for tax examinations. The Company does t have any material unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time and for any reason at the discretion of the board of directors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased shares of common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, which was reflected in treasury stock, with a cost of . Related treasury stock of shares as a result of the repurchases, with a cost of , was retired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in no treasury stock balance as of September 30, 2024.

shares of common stock were authorized to be issued under the 2018 Plan. Subsequently on June 3, 2020 and May 25, 2022, the Company s stockholders approved amendments to the 2018 Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2018 Plan to shares and shares, respectively. The primary purpose of the 2018 Plan, as amended, is to attract, retain, reward and motivate certain individuals by providing them with an opportunity to acquire or increase a proprietary interest in the Company and to incentivize them to expend maximum effort for the growth and success of the Company, so as to strengthen the mutuality of the interests between such individuals and the stockholders of the Company. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of common stock available for future issuance under the 2018 Plan, as amended. To date, all stock incentives issued under the 2018 Plan, as amended, have been in the form of RSUs. RSUs granted under the 2018 Plan, as amended, vest and settle upon the satisfaction of a time-based condition or with both time- and performance-based conditions. The time-based condition for these awards is generally satisfied over three or four years with annual vesting.

(b) Contingencies The Company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and it discloses the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for its financial statements to not be misleading. To estimate whether a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income, the Company evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss. The Company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. In addition to the foregoing, the Company may be involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the Company cannot assure you that the ultimate resolution of any legal or administrative proceeding or dispute will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q ). This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 PSLRA ), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), about our expectations, beliefs, or intentions regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies, or prospects. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends, or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those contained in this Form 10-Q, as well as the disclosures made in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 7, 2024 Form 10-K ), and other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

 Overview 
 Red Violet, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is dedicated to making the world a safer place and reducing the cost of doing business. We build proprietary technologies and apply analytical capabilities to deliver identity intelligence. Our technology powers critical solutions, which empower organizations to operate with confidence. Our solutions enable the real-time identification and location of people, businesses, assets, and their interrelationships. These solutions are used for purposes including identity verification, risk mitigation, due diligence, fraud detection and prevention, regulatory compliance, and customer acquisition. Our AI/ML-driven identity intelligence platform, CORE TM , is purpose-built for the enterprise, yet flexible enough for organizations of all sizes, bringing clarity to massive datasets by transforming data into intelligence. We drive workflow efficiency and enable organizations to make better data-driven decisions. 
 Organizations are challenged by the structure, volume, and disparity of data. Our platform and applications transform the way our customers interact with information, presenting connections and relevance of information otherwise unattainable, which drives actionable insights and better outcomes. Leveraging cloud-native proprietary technology and applying machine learning and advanced analytical capabilities, CORE provides essential solutions to public and private sector organizations through intuitive, easy-to-use analytical interfaces. With massive data assets consisting of public record, proprietary, and publicly-available data, our differentiated information and innovative platform and solutions deliver identity intelligence entities, relationships, affiliations, interactions, and events. Our solutions are used today to enable frictionless commerce, to ensure safety, and to reduce fraud and the concomitant expense borne by society. 
 While our platform powers a vast array of solutions for our customers, we presently market our solutions primarily through two brands, IDI and FOREWARN . IDI is a leading-edge, analytics and information solutions provider delivering actionable intelligence to an expansive and diverse set of industries in support of use cases such as the verification and authentication of consumer identities, due diligence, prevention of fraud and abuse, legislative compliance, and debt recovery. idiCORE is IDI's flagship product. idiCORE is a next-generation, investigative solution used to address a variety of organizational challenges, including, but not limited to, due diligence, risk mitigation, identity authentication, and regulatory compliance, by financial services companies, insurance companies, healthcare companies, law enforcement and government, identity verification platforms, collections, law firms, retail, telecommunication companies, corporate security, and investigative firms. FOREWARN is an app-based solution currently tailored for the real estate industry, providing instant knowledge prior to face-to-face engagement with a consumer, helping professionals identify and mitigate risk. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, IDI had 8,743 and 7,769 billable customers and FOREWARN had 284,967 and 168,356 users, respectively. We define a billable customer of IDI as a single entity that generated revenue during the last three months of the period. Billable customers are typically corporate organizations. In most cases, corporate organizations will have multiple users and/or departments purchasing our solutions, however, we count the entire organization as a discrete customer. We define a user of FOREWARN as a unique person that has a subscription to use the FOREWARN service as of the last day of the period. A unique person can only have one user account. 
 12 

We generate substantially all of our revenue from licensing our solutions. Customers access our solutions through a hosted environment using an online interface, batch processing, API and custom integrations. We recognize revenue from licensing fees (a) on a transactional basis determined by the customer s usage, (b) via a monthly fee or (c) from a combination of both. Revenue pursuant to pricing contracts containing a monthly fee is recognized ratably over the contract period. Pricing contracts are generally annual contracts or longer, with auto renewal. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 77 and 79 of total revenue was attributable to customers with pricing contracts, respectively, versus 23 and 21 attributable to transactional customers, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 76 and 78 of total revenue was attributable to customers with pricing contracts, respectively, versus 24 and 22 attributable to transactional customers, respectively. 
 We endeavor to understand our customers needs at the moment of first engagement. We continuously engage with our customers and evaluate their usage of our solutions throughout their life cycle, to maximize utilization of our solutions and, hence, their productivity. Our go-to-market strategy leverages (a) an inside sales team that cultivates relationships, and ultimately closes business, with their end-user markets, (b) a strategic sales team that provides a more personal, face-to-face approach for major accounts within certain industries, and (c) distributors, resellers, and strategic partners that have a significant foothold in many of the industries that we have not historically served, as well as to further penetrate those industries that we do serve. We employ a land and expand approach. Our sales model generally begins with a free trial followed by an initial purchase on a transactional basis or minimum-committed monthly spend. As organizations derive benefits from our solutions, we are able to expand within organizations as additional use cases are presented across departments, divisions and geographic locations and customers become increasingly reliant on our solutions in their daily workflow. 
 In order for us to continue to develop new products, grow our existing business and expand into additional markets, we must generate and sustain sufficient operating profits and cash flow in future periods. This will require us to generate additional sales from current products and new products currently under development. We continue to build out our sales organization to drive current products and to introduce new products into the marketplace. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of intangible assets, recoverability of the carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets, share-based compensation, and income tax provision. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 For additional information, please refer to our Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K.

The Company has 4.6 million remaining under the Stock Repurchase Program. 

Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management evaluates the financial performance of our business on a variety of key indicators, including non-GAAP metrics of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and free cash flow ("FCF"). Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, excluding interest income, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, litigation costs, and write-off of long-lived assets and others. We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of share-based compensation capitalized in intangible assets, and discrete tax items, and including the tax effect of adjustments. We define adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. We define adjusted gross profit as revenue less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), and adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchase of property and equipment, and capitalized costs included in intangible assets.

(1)	During the three months ended September 30, 2023, 10.3 million of income tax benefit was recognized as a result of the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded on our deferred tax asset and the cumulative research and development tax credit, which were excluded to calculate the adjusted net income. 
 
 (2)	The tax effect of adjustments is calculated using the expected federal and state statutory tax rate. The expected federal and state income tax rate was approximately 26.00 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 25.75 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

In order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the operating results that management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes, we present non-GAAP measures of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF as supplemental measures of our operating performance. We believe they provide useful information to our investors as they eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. In addition, we use them as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance and operating strength of our business. 
 We believe adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF are relevant and provide useful information frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours and are indicators of the operational strength of our business. We believe adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and the impact of other non-recurring items, providing useful comparisons versus prior periods or forecasts. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe adjusted net income provides additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, excluding share-based compensation expense, and amortization of share-based compensation capitalized in intangible assets, and including the tax effect of adjustments. We define adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Our adjusted gross profit is a measure used by management in evaluating the business s current operating performance by excluding the impact of prior historical costs of assets that are expensed systematically and allocated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which may not be indicative of the current operating activity. Our adjusted gross profit is calculated by using revenue, less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). We believe adjusted gross profit provides useful information to our investors by eliminating the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization, and specifically the amortization of software developed for internal use, providing a baseline of our core operating results that allow for analyzing trends in our underlying business consistently over multiple periods. Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue. We believe FCF is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business. FCF is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate the business s operating performance and trends over time. FCF is calculated by using net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase of property and equipment, and capitalized costs included in intangible assets. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, financial measures presented in accordance with US GAAP. In addition, FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. The way we measure adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.
 
 Results of Operations 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue . Revenue increased 3.3 million or 20 to 19.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from new customers increased 0.3 million or 19 , base revenue from existing customers increased 2.9 million or 23 , and growth revenue from existing customers increased 0.1 million or 3 . Our IDI billable customer base grew from 7,769 customers as of September 30, 2023 to 8,743 customers as of September 30, 2024, and our FOREWARN user base grew from 168,356 users to 284,967 users during that same period. Revenue from new customers represents the total monthly revenue generated from new customers in a given period. A customer is defined as a new customer during the first six months of revenue generation. Base revenue from existing customers represents the total monthly revenue generated from existing customers in a given period that does not exceed the customers' trailing six-month average revenue. A customer is defined as an existing customer six months after their initial month of revenue. Growth revenue from existing customers represents the total monthly revenue generated from existing customers in a given period in excess of the customers' trailing six-month average revenue.

Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) . Cost of revenue remained consistent at 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our cost of revenue primarily includes data acquisition costs. Data acquisition costs consist primarily of the costs to acquire data either on a transactional basis or through flat-fee data licensing agreements, including unlimited usage agreements. We continue to enhance the breadth and depth of our data through the addition and expansion of relationships with key data suppliers, including our largest data supplier, which accounted for 48 and 47 of our total data acquisition costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other cost of revenue items include expenses related to third-party infrastructure fees and pertinent personnel costs. 
 As the construct of our data costs is primarily a flat-fee, unlimited usage model, the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to 17 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 21 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will continue to decrease over the coming years as our revenue increases. Historically, at scale, the industry business model s cost of revenue will trend between 15 and 30 as a percentage of revenue. 
 Sales and marketing expenses . Sales and marketing expenses increased 1.4 million or 43 to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and benefits, advertising and marketing, travel expenses, and share-based compensation expense, incurred by our sales team, and provision for bad debts. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the increase of 1.3 million in salaries and benefits, and sales commission. 
 General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses increased 0.8 million or 15 to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of employee salaries and benefits of 2.9 million and 2.4 million, respectively, share-based compensation expense of 1.5 million and 1.3 million, respectively, and professional fees of 0.9 million and 0.9 million, respectively. 
 Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 0.2 million or 12 to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from the amortization of software developed for internal use that became ready for its intended use after September 30, 2023. 
 Interest income, net . Interest income, net increased 0.1 million or 1 to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to interest income earned on investments in certain money market funds. 
 Income before income taxes . Income before income taxes increased 0.8 million or 35 to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue, and decrease in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue, which was partially offset by the increase in employee salaries and benefits and sales commissions of 1.8 million, share-based compensation expense of 0.3 million, and depreciation and amortization of 0.2 million. 
 Income taxes . Income tax expense of 1.1 million was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax benefit of 10.4 million, inclusive of a one-time deferred income tax benefit of 10.3 million as a result of the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded on deferred tax asset and the cumulative research and development tax credit, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company released the valuation allowance previously recorded against its deferred tax assets as the Company concluded that the realization of the deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2023 is more likely than not. See Note 6, Income taxes, included in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Net income . Net income was 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the foregoing. 
 17 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue . Revenue increased 10.5 million or 23 to 55.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 45.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from new customers increased 0.7 million or 15 , base revenue from existing customers increased 7.5 million or 21 , and growth revenue from existing customers increased 2.3 million or 42 . Our IDI billable customer base grew from 7,769 customers as of September 30, 2023 to 8,743 customers as of September 30, 2024, and our FOREWARN user base grew from 168,356 users to 284,967 users during that same period. Revenue from new customers represents the total monthly revenue generated from new customers in a given period. A customer is defined as a new customer during the first six months of revenue generation. Base revenue from existing customers represents the total monthly revenue generated from existing customers in a given period that does not exceed the customers' trailing six-month average revenue. A customer is defined as an existing customer six months after their initial month of revenue. Growth revenue from existing customers represents the total monthly revenue generated from existing customers in a given period in excess of the customers' trailing six-month average revenue. 
 Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) . Cost of revenue increased 0.8 million or 8 to 10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our cost of revenue primarily includes data acquisition costs. Data acquisition costs consist primarily of the costs to acquire data either on a transactional basis or through flat-fee data licensing agreements, including unlimited usage agreements. We continue to enhance the breadth and depth of our data through the addition and expansion of relationships with key data suppliers, including our largest data supplier, which accounted for 45 and 48 of our total data acquisition costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other cost of revenue items include expenses related to third-party infrastructure fees and pertinent personnel costs. 
 As the construct of our data costs is primarily a flat-fee, unlimited usage model, the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to 19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect that cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue will continue to decrease over the coming years as our revenue increases. Historically, at scale, the industry business model s cost of revenue will trend between 15 and 30 as a percentage of revenue. 
 Sales and marketing expenses . Sales and marketing expenses increased 2.6 million or 25 to 12.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and benefits, advertising and marketing, travel expenses, and share-based compensation expense, incurred by our sales team, and provision for bad debts. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the increase of 2.8 million in salaries and benefits, and sales commission, which was offset by the decrease of 0.6 million in provision for bad debts. 
 General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses increased 2.0 million or 13 to 17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of employee salaries and benefits of 8.5 million and 7.7 million, respectively, share-based compensation expense of 4.0 million and 3.7 million, respectively, and professional fees of 3.1 million and 2.3 million, respectively. 
 Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 1.0 million or 15 to 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from the amortization of software developed for internal use that became ready for its intended use after September 30, 2023. 
 Interest income, net . Interest income, net increased 0.1 million or 9 to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to interest income earned on investments in certain money market funds. 
 Income before income taxes . Income before income taxes increased 4.3 million or 97 to 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue, decrease in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue, and decrease in provision for bad debts of 0.6 million, which was partially offset by the increase in employee salaries and benefits and sales commissions of 3.6 million, share-based compensation expense of 0.4 million, professional fees of 0.8 million, and depreciation and amortization of 1.0 million. 
 Income taxes . Income tax expense of 2.4 million was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax benefit of 10.3 million, primarily a one-time deferred income tax benefit as a result of the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded on deferred tax asset and the cumulative research and development tax credit, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Beginning from the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company released the valuation allowance previously recorded against its deferred tax assets as the Company concluded that the realization of the deferred tax assets as of 
 18 

September 30, 2023 is more likely than not. See Note 6, Income taxes, included in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Net income . Net income was 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the foregoing. 
 Effect of Inflation 
 We believe that the persistent inflationary pressure throughout 2023 and up to September 30, 2024 has contributed to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and increased recession fears, causing businesses to slow their spending over the last several months, which have resulted, and may continue to result, in fluctuations in volumes, pricing and operating margins for our services. Also, higher interest rates imposed to combat inflation, may reduce the demand for credit, which may lead to a decline in the volume of services we provide to our customers in the banking or financial industry, or other industries that are affected by these types of disruptions. However, the rates of inflation experienced in recent years have had no material impact on our financial statements as we have attempted to recover increased costs by increasing prices for our services, to the extent permitted by contracts and competition. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 17.3 million, primarily the result of the net income of 6.1 million, adjusted for certain non-cash items (consisting of share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, write-off of long-lived assets, provision for bad debts, noncash lease expenses, and deferred income tax expense (benefit)) totaling 14.4 million, and the cash used as a result of changes in assets and liabilities of 3.3 million, primarily the result of the increase in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and other noncurrent assets, and the decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, which was partially offset by the increase in accounts payable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 10.9 million, primarily the result of the net income of 14.6 million, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as mentioned above, totaling (1.3) million, and the cash used as a result of changes in assets and liabilities of 5.0 million, primarily the result of the increase in accounts receivable, and prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 7.3 million and 7.0 million, respectively, primarily as a result of capitalized costs included in intangible assets. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 6.3 million, resulting from the taxes paid related to the net share settlement of vesting of RSUs of 0.4 million, and the result of 5.9 million paid in aggregate for the repurchase of common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program that the board of directors authorized on May 2, 2022 (the "Stock Repurchase Program"), authorizing the repurchase of up to 5.0 million of our common stock. Subsequently on each of December 19, 2023 and March 28, 2024, the board of directors approved the repurchases of an additional 5.0 million of our common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 1.4 million, mainly the result of 1.3 million paid in aggregate for the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Stock Repurchase Program. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had material commitments under certain data licensing agreements of 15.2 million. We anticipate funding our operations using available cash and cash flow generated from operations within the next twelve months. 
 We reported net income of 1.7 million and 12.5 million (inclusive of a one-time deferred income tax benefit of 10.3 million as a result of the release of valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets and the cumulative research and development tax credit) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6.1 million and 14.6 million (inclusive of a one-time deferred income tax benefit of 10.3 million as a result of the release of valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets and the cumulative research and development tax credit) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had a total shareholders equity balance of 91.7 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 35.7 million. Based on projections of growth in revenue and operating results in the next twelve months, and the available cash and cash equivalents held by us, we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources to finance our operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. 
 Subject to revenue growth and our ability to generate positive cash flow, we may have to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt, which, if we are able to obtain, could have the effect of diluting stockholders. Any equity or debt financings, if available at all, may be on terms which are not favorable to us.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 As a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include information required by this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d 15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II - OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 The Company is not currently a party to any legal proceeding, investigation or claim which, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Legal fees associated with such legal proceedings, are expensed as incurred. We review legal proceedings and claims on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance, including Accounting Standards Codification 450, Contingencies , when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. To estimate whether a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. 
 In addition to the foregoing, we may be involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot assure you that the ultimate resolution of any legal or administrative proceeding or dispute will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On May 2, 2022, the board of directors of the Company authorized the Stock Repurchase Program to repurchase the Company's common stock from time to time, which was subsequently amended on each of December 19, 2023 and March 28, 2024. The Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares and it may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time and for any reason at the discretion of the board of directors. 
 The Company did not repurchase any common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024 pursuant to the Stock Repurchase Program, and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the Stock Repurchase Program is 4,576,646. 
 Shares of common stock withheld as payment of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of equity awards are also treated as common stock repurchases. Those withheld shares of common stock are not required to be disclosed under Item 703 of Regulation S-K and accordingly are excluded from the amounts mentioned above. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 Item 4. Mine Saf ety Disclosures. 
 Not Applicable. 
 Item 5. Other Information.
