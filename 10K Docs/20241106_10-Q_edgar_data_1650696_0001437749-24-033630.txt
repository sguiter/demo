CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements convey our current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but they are open to a wide range of uncertainties and business risks. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Any statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. When we use the words anticipates, believes, continues, could, estimates, expects, intends, may, plans, potential, predicts, seeks, should, will, would, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, we are identifying forward-looking statements. 
 
 Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Key factors that could cause actual results to be different than expected or anticipated include, but are not limited to: 

our limited operating history and ability to become profitable; 

our ability to manage our growth, including our human resource requirements; 

our reliance on third parties for raw materials and production of our products; 

our future capital resources and needs; 

our ability to retain and grow our customer base; 

our reliance on independent distributors for a substantial portion of our sales; 

our ability to evaluate and measure our business, prospects, and performance metrics; 

our ability to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and evolving industry; 

the health of the premium organic and natural food industry as a whole; 

risks related to our intellectual property rights and developing a strong brand; 

our reliance on key personnel, including Laird Hamilton and Gabrielle Reece; 

regulatory risks; 

the risk of substantial dilution from future issuances of our equity securities; and 

the other risks described herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which are inherently unreliable and speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this report with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements may be materially different from what we expect. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report. We qualify all our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. We are not under any obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 Definite-lived intangible assets 
 
 Definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the Company uses the asset, or an unexpected change in financial performance. When evaluating definite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. The Company considered the above factors when assessing whether its' long-lived assets will be recoverable. 
 
 Based on the analysis of the qualitative factors above, management determined that there were no triggering events or impairment charges for the Company's definite-lived intangible assets in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 

Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years. The estimated amortization expense for each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows: 

2025 
 2026

Indefinite-lived intangible assets 
 
 On August 3, 2015, the Company entered into a license agreement with the Company s co-founder Laird Hamilton (the LH License ). The LH License stated Mr. Hamilton s contribution to the Company was in the form of intellectual property, granting the Company the right to use Mr. Hamilton s name and likeness. This contribution, which was reported on the balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , was valued at and satisfied with the issuance of shares of common stock. The Company has determined that the intangible asset associated with the LH License has an indefinite life, as there is no foreseeable limit on the period of time over which it is expected to contribute to the cash flows of the Company. 
 
 On May 2, 2018, the Company entered into a license agreement with Gabrielle Reece, who is married to Mr. Hamilton (the GR License ). Pursuant to the GR License, Ms. Reece granted the Company rights to her name, signature, voice, picture, image, likeness, and biographical information. This contribution, which is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , was valued at based on the consideration exchanged. The Company has determined that the intangible asset associated with the GR License has an indefinite life, as there is no foreseeable limit on the period of time over which it is expected to contribute to the cash flows of the Company. 
 
 On November 19, 2018, the Company executed a License and Preservation Agreement (the "2018 License") with Mr. Hamilton and Ms. Reece which superseded the LH License and GR License. The agreement added specific terms related to non-competition and allowable usage of the property under the license. No additional monetary consideration was exchanged in connection with the agreement and the life of the agreement was set at years. 
 
 On May 26, 2020, the Company executed a License and Preservation Agreement with Mr. Hamilton, and Ms. Reece (the 2020 License ), which superseded the 2018 License. Among other modifications, the agreement (i) modified certain approval rights of Mr. Hamilton and Ms. Reece for use of their respective images, signatures, voices, and names (other than those owned by the Company), rights of publicity and common law and statutory rights to the foregoing in the Company s products, (ii) modified certain assignment, change of control and indemnification provisions, and (iii) granted the Company the right to extend the term of the agreement for additional ten -year terms upon the expiration of the initial one -hundred year term. No additional monetary consideration was exchanged in connection with the agreement. 

The Company executed a lease cancellation agreement dated December 12, 2022. Under this agreement, the Company's three leases with RII Lundgren Mill, LLC, were terminated effective January 31, 2023, and the Company agreed to pay , of which was remitted in 2022 and was satisfied in the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 The Company assumed an operating lease in the acquisition of Picky Bars, LLC on May 3, 2021. The initial lease term is months, and the Company has the option to renew the lease for two additional three -year periods. 
 
 The Company entered into a sublease agreement with Somatic Experiencing Trauma Institute with a commencement date of January 1, 2023, for a square foot office space in Boulder, Colorado which serves as the Company's current headquarters. This lease will expire on July 1, 2027.

As of September 30, 2024 , the Company did not provide a current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because the Company has reported cumulative losses since inception. The Company has recorded a provision for state income taxes and a corresponding current state income tax payable of approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The following tables presents net operating losses ("NOLs") and other income tax carryforwards for the following periods: 

Federal NOLs post-2018 (2) 
 State NOLs (3) 
 Total NOLs 
 Credits (4) 
 Other carryforwards (4) 
 Total NOLs and other income tax carryforwards 
 (1) Can be carried forward for 20 years and which begin to expire in 2036 
 (2) Can be carried forward indefinitely. 
 (3) Can be carried forward for between 15 and 20 years and which begin to expire in 2031. 
 (4) Can be carried forward for between one and five years and which begin to expire in 2025. 

The use of net operating losses may be subject to certain limitations, such as those triggered by ownership changes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Because these provisions, the use of a portion of the Company's NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in future periods. Further, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. 
 
 The Company assesses its deferred tax assets and liabilities to determine if it is more likely than not, they will be realized; if not, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded. Management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized, thus a full valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets. The Company may reduce the valuation allowance against definite-lived deferred tax assets at such a time when it becomes more likely than not that the definite-lived deferred tax assets will be realized. The change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were net increases of million and million, respectively. 
 
 GAAP requires management to evaluate and report information regarding its exposure to various tax positions taken by the Company. The Company has determined whether there are any tax positions that have met the recognition threshold and has measured the Company s exposure to those tax positions.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Laird Superfood, Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiary on a consolidated basis, the "Company," "Laird Superfood," "our," "us," or "we") is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K"). This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the section titled Risk Factors included herein and in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Laird Superfood creates highly differentiated, plant-based, and functional foods, many of which incorporate adaptogens which may support a variety of brain functions. The core pillars of the Laird Superfood platform are currently (i) Superfood Creamer coffee creamers, (ii) Hydrate hydration products and beverage enhancing supplements, (iii) Harvest snacks and other food items, and (iv) functional roasted and instant coffees, teas, and hot chocolate. Consumer preferences within the evolving food and beverage industry are shifting away from processed and sugar-laden food and beverage products, as well as those containing significant amounts of highly processed and artificial ingredients. Our long-term goal is to build the first scale-level and widely recognized brand that authentically focuses on natural ingredients, nutritional density, and functionality, which we believe will allow us to maximize penetration of a multi-billion-dollar opportunity in the grocery market. We generate revenue through two channels: e-commerce and wholesale. 
 
 Financial Highlights 
 
 Net sales were 11.8 million and 9.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, representing 28 growth from the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net sales were 31.7 million and 25.0 million, respectively, representing 27 growth from the prior year period. E-commerce channel sales increased by 42 in the third quarter of 2024 and 41 in year-to-date ("YTD") 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 despite significant, planned reductions in media spend. Sales through Amazon.com increased by 133 in the third quarter of 2024 ("Q3 2024") compared to the third quarter of 2023 ("Q3 2023"), and by 85 when comparing the 2024 and 2023 YTD periods, driven primarily by product availability and successful sales execution. Direct-to-Consumer ("DTC") sales, on lairdsuperfood.com and pickybars.com, increased by 10 in Q3 2024 compared to the prior year period, and increased by 22 comparing YTD periods, driven by strong performance in both subscription and repeat customers, increasing average order value, and improved discount rates due to strategic shifts in promotional spend. Wholesale channel net sales increased by 13 in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023, and increased 11 comparing YTD periods, driven by distribution expansion in grocery as well as velocity growth and more efficient promotional spend across. 
 
 Our e-commerce channel is comprised of sales through DTC lairdsuperfood.com and pickybars.com and Amazon.com . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the e-commerce channel made up 58 and 59 of our net sales, respectively, compared to 53 and 54 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Amazon.com accounted for 43 and 40 of our e-commerce channel sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 26 and 30 for the corresponding prior year periods. Lairdsuperfood.com and pickybars.com are platforms that provide an authentic brand experience for our consumers that drive engagement through educational content and provide feedback for future product development. We view our proprietary database of customers ordering directly from our website as a strategic asset, as it enhances our ability to develop a long-term relationship with these customers. We believe the content on our websites allows Laird Superfood to educate consumers on the benefits of our products and ingredients while providing a positive customer experience. We believe this experience leads to higher retention rates among repeat users and subscribers, as evidenced by repeat users and subscribers accounting for over three quarters of DTC sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the wholesale channel made up 42 and 41 of our net sales, respectively, compared to 47 and 46 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Laird Superfood products are sold through a diverse set of retail channels, including conventional, natural, and specialty grocery stores, and club stores.

Recent Developments 
 
 Entry into an Accounts Receivable Factoring Agreement 
 
 On May 7, 2024, we entered into an accounts receivable factoring agreement (the Factoring Agreement with Alterna Capital Solutions LLC (the Purchaser ). The Factoring Agreement allows us to access up to 2 million on a revolving basis. The upfront purchase price for factored accounts is up to 70 of their face value, with the remainder payable to us upon collection by the Purchaser. The proceeds, if any, will be used to fund general working capital needs. Pursuant to the Factoring Agreement, we will pay fees, including a funds usage fee (prime rate + 1.5 , minimum 10 per annum) and a collateral monitoring fee (0.05 per month). The Factoring Agreement provides that the Purchaser can require repurchase of uncollectable or ineligible accounts. 
 
 The Factoring Agreement has an initial term of 12 months and will automatically renew annually, unless terminated in accordance with the Factoring Agreement. We may terminate the Factoring Agreement at any time upon 30 days prior written notice and payment to Purchaser of an early termination fee equal to 2.0 of the Maximum Amount (as defined in the Factoring Agreement) if terminated during the first 12 months and 1.0 of the Maximum Amount during the subsequent terms. 
 
 Pursuant to the Factoring Agreement, we granted a security interest to the Purchaser in our personal property to secure the payment and performance of all obligations under the Factoring Agreement. 
 
 Our Strategy and Key Factors Affecting our Performance 
 
 We believe that our future performance will depend on many factors, including the following: 
 
 Ability to Grow Our Customer Base in both E-commerce and Traditional Wholesale Distribution Channels 
 
 We are currently seeking to grow our customer base through both paid and organic online channels, as well as by expanding our presence in a variety of physical wholesale distribution channels. E-commerce customer acquisitions typically occur at our websites, lairdsuperfood.com and pickybars.com , and through Amazon.com . Our e-commerce customer acquisition program includes paid and unpaid social media, search, display, and traditional media. Our products are also sold through a growing number of wholesale channels. Wholesale customers include grocery chains, natural food outlets, club stores, drug stores, and food service customers including coffee shops, gyms, restaurants, hospitality venues and corporate dining services, among others. Customer acquisition in physical wholesale channels depends on, among other things, paid promotions through retailers, display, and traditional media. 
 
 Ability to Manage Co-Manufacturer and Third-Party Logistics Relationships 
 
 All of our production and logistics is handled by third parties, and our performance is and will continue to be highly dependent on the ability of these partners to produce and deliver our products in a timely manner and to our standards and at a reasonable cost. 
 
 Ability to Acquire and Retain Customers at a Reasonable Cost 
 
 We believe an ability to consistently acquire and retain customers at a reasonable cost relative to projected lifetime value will be a key factor affecting future performance. To accomplish this goal, we intend to balance advertising spend between online and offline channels, as well as balancing more targeted and measurable direct response marketing spend with advertising focused on increasing our long-term brand recognition, where success attribution is less directly measurable on a near-term basis. 
 
 Ability to Drive Repeat Usage of Our Products 
 
 We accrue substantial economic value from repeat customers who consistently re-order our products. The pace of our growth will be affected by the repeat usage dynamics of existing and newly acquired customers. 
 
 Ability to Expand Our Product Line 
 
 Our goal is to expand our product line over time to increase our growth opportunity and reduce product-specific risks through diversification into multiple products, each designed around daily use. Our pace of growth will be partially affected by the cadence and magnitude of new product launches over time.

The increase in net sales was primarily driven by a 42 increase in sales in the e-commerce channel through both Amazon.com and DTC platforms. DTC grew despite planned reductions in media spend and was fueled by a growing subscription and repeat customer base as well as higher average order value ("AOV"). Amazon grew 133 as compared to reduced sales volume in the 2023 period from out-of-stocks associated with a quality event. Further, the wholesale channel also grew by 13 in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 driven primarily by velocity improvements and distribution gains in grocery stores, and more efficient promotional spend.

The increase in cost of goods sold is driven by growth in sales volume, offset by lower product costs due to a shift to the direct procurement of key raw materials, as well as recoveries on costs previously incurred in connection with the quality event we experienced in 2023 as part of the settlement we reached with a supplier.

The increase in net sales was primarily driven by 41 growth in the e-commerce channel sales through both the Amazon.com and DTC platforms. DTC grew despite reductions in media spend and was fueled by a growing subscriber and repeat customer base as well as higher AOV. Amazon grew 85 as compared to reduced sales volume in 2023 from out-of-stocks associated with a quality event. Further, the wholesale channel also grew by 11 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding 2023 period, driven primarily by distribution expansion, growing velocities, and more efficient promotional spend.

Cash provided by operating activities for YTD 2024 was enabled by our greatly improved margins and reduced selling, marketing, and administrative expenses resulting from the business model transformation we undertook over the last twelve months, as well as efficient working capital management. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities for YTD 2024 consists of purchases of office equipment. The cash generated in in the prior year period was due to the sale of property and equipment related to the Sisters, Oregon exit. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities consists of common stock related costs, offset in part by stock option exercises. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 107.7 million, which includes operating losses of 1.7 million and 10.7 million for YTD 2024 and YTD 2023, respectively. While we expect to incur additional operating losses as we continue efforts to grow our business, the strategic business transformation that we have undertaken over the last two years has become evident in our significant gross margin expansion, optimized investments in trade and marketing, lower selling, general, and administrative spending, and reduced cash burn. We will continue to seek opportunities to optimize spending, expand gross margins, and free up cash flow through efficient working capital management. We have historically financed our operations and capital expenditures through private placements of our common stock, our initial public offering ("IPO"), lines of credit, and term loans. Our historical uses of cash have primarily consisted of cash used in operating activities and working capital needs. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 8.2 million and 7.7 million, respectively, of cash-on-hand, and total net working capital of 11.8 million and 12.0 million for the same periods. As of September 30, 2024, we had access to up to 1.2 million of advances under the Factoring Agreement, of which none had been utilized. We have no significant unused sources of liquid assets outside of our working capital. 
 
 Additionally, on September 15, 2023, we entered into a settlement agreement (the "2023 Settlement Agreement") with a supplier (the "Supplier") to recover losses incurred in connection with the product quality issue with coconut milk powder that we experienced in 2023, pursuant to which the Supplier was obligated to, among other things, pay the Company 50,000 and provide a discount to the Company on the sale of future products of up to 950,000. On February 27, 2024, we filed a complaint against the Supplier in the District Court of Boulder, Colorado alleging that the Supplier breached the 2023 Settlement Agreement by failing to deliver acceptable coconut milk powder (the "Litigation"). Both parties dispute liability. As a result of the Litigation, on July 30, 2024, the Company entered into an additional settlement agreement with the Supplier, pursuant to which, among other things, the Supplier agreed to remit cash payment to us of approximately 500,000. As of September 30, 2024, 285,000 was receivable from the Supplier and was included in prepaid and other current assets on the balance sheets. 
 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the continued expansion of sales and marketing activities, the enhancement of our product platforms, and the introduction of new products, and acquisition activity. Recent and expected working and other capital requirements, in addition to the above matters, also include the items described below: 

We have lease arrangements for corporate office space. As of September 30, 2024, we had fixed lease payment obligations of 0.3 million, with 0.1 million payable within 12 months. 

As of September 30, 2024, 5.4 million of current liabilities were accrued related to short-term operating activities and personnel costs, excluding the aforementioned current lease liabilities. 

Marketing and advertising expenditures, including related party advertising costs, were 5.2 million in YTD 2024 and 6.7 million in YTD 2023. We expect to continue to invest in these activities as part of the strategic expansion of sales volume, however, we have made strategic shifts to reduce and improve the efficacy of future customer acquisition costs.

Based on our current business plans, we believe that our existing cash balances, including our anticipated cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements through at least the eighteen months following the date of this report. In the future, we may raise funds by issuing debt or equity securities, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. Such financing and other potential financing may result in dilution to stockholders, reduction in the market price of our common stock, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 Segment Information 
 
 We have one operating segment and one reportable segment. Our Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results require our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 
 As a company with less than 1.235 billion in annual gross revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

a requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; 

an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; 

reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and 

no non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

We may take advantage of these provisions until the end of the fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary of our IPO occurs, or such earlier time when we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We will cease to be an emerging growth company on the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) in which we have more than 1.235 billion in annual gross revenue or (b) in which we have more than 700 million in market value of our capital stock held by non-affiliates, or (2) the date on which we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all these reduced burdens. 
 
 In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and therefore we will not be subject to the same requirements to adopt new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Company management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Part II. Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 From time to time, we may be involved in claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. To our knowledge, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 There were no material changes to the Risk Factors disclosed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in the 2023 Form 10-K during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.
