of its investment company taxable income for that year, which is generally its ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of its realized net short-term capital gains over its realized net long-term capital losses. In addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Company distributes in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of its net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of capital gains in excess of capital losses (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. For this purpose, however, any net ordinary income or capital gains retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income. The Company has analyzed the tax positions taken on federal and state income tax returns for all open tax years and has concluded that provision for income tax for uncertain tax positions is required in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company s major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal, New York State, and foreign jurisdictions where the Company makes significant investments. The Company s federal and state income and federal excise tax returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have not expired are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of revenue.

from its effective date and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by (i) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, and (ii) the vote of a majority of the Company s Board who are not parties to the Investment Advisory Agreement or interested persons of the Company, of the Adviser or of any of their respective affiliates, as defined in the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon 60 days written notice and, in certain circumstances, upon 120 days written notice, by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of the Company or by the vote of the Board or by the Adviser. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Adviser a base management fee and a performance-based incentive fee. Prior to July 1, 2023, the base management fee was payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the Company s total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. Beginning on July 1, 2023, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the Company s net assets as of the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter; provided that the base management fee shall not be greater than of the Company s total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, management fees were million and million , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , management fees were million and million , respectively. , each as described below. (1) Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income

For purposes of the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income calculations, each calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters that commenced prior to October 1, 2023 shall be known as a Legacy Fee Quarter while a calendar quarter that commenced on or after October 1, 2023 shall be known as a Current Fee Quarter. The Preferred Return Amount will be determined on a quarterly basis, and will be calculated by multiplying 1.75 by the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Preferred Return Amount will be calculated after making appropriate adjustments to the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter for Company subscriptions and distributions during the applicable calendar quarter. The amount of the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income that will be paid to the Adviser for a particular quarter will equal the excess of the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income so calculated less the aggregate Subordinated Incentive Fees on Income that were paid to the Adviser and/or earned, but waived, by the Adviser, in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including, without limitation, any accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash and any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) (the Ordinary Income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses accrued during the calendar quarter (including, without limitation, the Management Fee, administration expenses and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income and the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains). For the avoidance of doubt, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Net Capital Loss in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. Prior to October 1, 2023, the calculation of the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income for each quarter is as follows: (A) Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income shall be payable to the Adviser in any calendar quarter in which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters does not exceed the Preferred Return Amount;

The Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of on all of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches 2.0588 per quarter (8.24 annualized) during the Trailing Twelve Quarters; and 

 (C) For any quarter in which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds the Catch-Up Amount, the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income shall equal of the amount of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such Trailing Twelve Quarters, as the Preferred Return Amount and Catch-Up Amount will have been achieved. 

 Beginning on October 1, 2023, the calculation of the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income for each quarter is as follows: (A) Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income shall be payable to the Adviser in any calendar quarter in which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters does not exceed the Preferred Return Amount; 

 (B) of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the Preferred Return Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the Catch-Up Amount determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying (i) 2.0588 by the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable Legacy Fee Quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters, or (ii) 2.0 by the Company s NAV at the beginning of each applicable Current Fee Quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of , with respect to each Legacy Fee Quarter, and 12.5 , with respect to each Current Fee Quarter, on all of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches 2.0588 or 2.0 (8.24 or 8.0 annualized, respectively), as applicable, during the Trailing Twelve Quarters; and 

 (C) For any quarter in which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds the Catch-Up Amount, the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income shall equal for each Legacy Fee Quarter and for each Current Fee Quarter of the amount of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such Trailing Twelve Quarters, as the Preferred Return Amount and Catch-Up Amount will have been achieved, provided, however, that the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income for any quarter shall not be greater than or , as applicable, of the amount of the Company s current quarter s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income. 

 The Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is an amount equal to (a) of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Legacy Fee Quarters included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters and of the cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Current Fee Quarters included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less (b) the aggregate Subordinated Incentive Fees on Income that were paid to the Adviser and/or earned, but waived, by the Adviser in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. For this purpose, Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters means (x) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters less (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company shall pay no Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income to the Adviser in that quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is a positive value but is less than the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income calculated in accordance with the above, the Company shall pay the Adviser the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is equal to or greater than the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income calculated in accordance with the above, the Company shall pay the Adviser the Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income for such quarter. (2) Incentive Fee on Capital Gains 

 The Incentive Fee on Capital Gains shall be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement). This fee shall equal prior to October 1, 2023 and beginning October 1, 2023 of the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any Incentive Fees on Capital Gains previously paid to the Adviser. The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation of the Company shall be calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the Company s portfolio as of the applicable calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. For accounting purposes only, the Company accrues, but does not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized capital appreciation. The accrual of this theoretical capital gains incentive fee assumes all unrealized capital appreciation is realized in order to reflect a theoretical capital gains incentive fee that would be payable to the Investment Adviser at each measurement date.

As of September 30, 2024 , the valuation method used for certain investments classified as Healthcare Pharmaceuticals and Wholesale amounting to million changed from the discounted cash flow or yield analysis valuation method to the enterprise value waterfall valuation method. The change was due to changing market conditions and is intended to more accurately reflect the go forward performance of such investments.

The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing Level 3 debt investments utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or yield analysis. To conduct a discounted cash flow analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon projected cash flows in the valuation models. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Level 3 investments include the discount rate applied in the valuation models to determine the present value of the projected cash flows. Increases in the discount rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment; conversely, decreases in the discount rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment. The discount rate is determined based on the market rates an investor would expect for a similar investment with similar risks. To conduct a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and investments with similar risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to the expected life of the investment, portfolio company performance since the date of investment, and other terms and risks associated with the investment. Among other factors, a determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to its total enterprise value, and the rights and remedies of the Company s investment within the portfolio company s capital structure. When the debtor is not performing or when there is insufficient value to cover the investment, the Company may utilize an enterprise value waterfall approach to determine the fair value of debt investments in the applicable portfolio companies. An enterprise value waterfall analysis typically consists of two steps. First, the total enterprise value for the portfolio company is estimated using standard valuation approaches, most commonly the market approach. Second, the fair value for each investment in the portfolio company is then estimated by allocating the portfolio company s total enterprise value to the outstanding securities in the capital structure based upon various factors, including seniority, preferences, and other features if deemed relevant to each security in the capital structure. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 debt investments primarily include discount rates and current market yields, including relevant market indices, but may also include quotes from brokers, dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable investments. For the Company s Level 3 equity investments, an enterprise value analysis, based on comparable financial performance multiples such as publicly-traded company and comparable market transaction multiples of revenues, earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), or some combination thereof and comparable market transactions typically would be used.

The Company also pays a fee of per annum on the outstanding balance under the SPV Facility beginning on July 14, 2022. The SPV Facility terminates on October 2, 2026. In connection with the SPV Facility, on October 4, 2021, the Company entered into a sale and contribution agreement with the ODL SPV, which provides for the sale and contribution of certain loans to the ODL SPV and for future sales from the Company to the ODL SPV on an ongoing basis. Such loans sold and contributed to ODL SPV constitute part of the initial portfolio of assets securing the SPV Facility. The SPV Facility includes customary covenants, including certain financial maintenance covenants, limitation on the activities of ODL SPV, including limitations on incurrence of incremental indebtedness, and customary events of default. The SPV Facility is secured by a lien on assets held by the ODL SPV and on any payments received by ODL SPV in respect of those assets. Refer to Note 11 for discussion of the termination of the SPV Facility subsequent to September 30, 2024. Further, as discussed in Note 3 above, on September 8, 2022, the Company entered into the Revolving Onex Loan with the Onex Entity. On May 5, 2023, the Company terminated the Revolving Onex Loan and entered into the Revolving OCF II Loan with OCF II.

Distributions The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any sources of funds available to it, including offering proceeds, borrowings, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, non-capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends or other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and fee and expense reimbursement waivers from the Adviser or the Administrator, if any. The Company has not established limits on the amount of funds it may use from available sources to make distributions. During certain periods, the Company s distributions may exceed its taxable earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions the Company makes may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a shareholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from the Company s investment activities. With respect to distributions, the Company has adopted an opt out DRP for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the DRP will have their distributions automatically reinvested in additional common shares rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of common shares will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.

Although the Company intends to offer to repurchase up to of its common shares outstanding in each quarter, the Board has in the past, and may in the future, increase the size of the tender offer, if the Board determines such an increase to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. The Board has complete discretion to determine whether the Company will offer to repurchase any of its common shares, and if so, the terms of such repurchase. At the discretion of the Board, the Company may use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares. All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. Any periodic repurchase offers are subject in part to the Company s available cash and compliance with the BDC and RIC qualification and diversification rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and the Code, respectively. While the Company intends to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers as described above, the Company is not required to do so and may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time.

On October 3, 2024 (the Closing Date ), the ODL SPV terminated and repaid in full the SPV Facility. Also on October 3, 2024, the ODL SPV, as the borrower, and the Company, solely in its capacities as the transferor and as the servicer, entered into a Loan and Servicing Agreement with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation SMBC ), as initial lender and as the administrative agent and as the collateral agent, and certain financial institutions (the SMBC Facility Lenders ), and U.S. Bank National Association as account bank and as the collateral custodian (the SMBC Facility ). From time to time, the Company sells and contributes certain investments to the ODL SPV pursuant to a contribution agreement between the Company and the ODL SPV. No gain or loss will be recognized as a result of the contribution. Proceeds from the SMBC Facility will be used to finance the origination or acquisition of eligible loan assets by the ODL SPV, including the purchase of such assets from the Company. The Company retains a residual interest in assets contributed to or acquired by the ODL SPV through the Company s ownership of the ODL SPV. The current maximum principal amount of the SMBC Facility is million (which consists of million of revolving commitments), which may be increased up to a maximum facility amount of billion, subject to the requirements set forth in the SMBC Facility, including lender consent. The availability of this amount is subject to an overcollateralization ratio test, which is based on the value of ODL SPV s assets from time to time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, including an interest coverage ratio test, certain concentration limits and collateral quality tests. The SMBC Facility provides for the ability to draw and redraw revolving loans under the SMBC Facility through October 3, 2027, unless the revolving commitments are terminated sooner in the SMBC Facility. The reinvestment period end date (after which no borrowings may be drawn under the SMBC Facility) and the maturity date under the SMBC Facility are October 3, 2027 and October 3, 2029, respectively, unless otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysi s of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The discussion and analysis contained in this section refers to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this Quarterly Report. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements set forth on page 1 of this Quarterly Report. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise indicated, the terms we, us, our, and the Company refer to Onex Direct Lending BDC Fund . 
 Overview 
 We are a Delaware statutory trust structured as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets , meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements, and timely distribute to our shareholders generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income for each year. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount of non-qualifying assets to total assets was approximately 7.1 and 5.8 , respectively. 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income while preserving capital, and to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. 
 We invest primarily in high-quality senior secured first lien loans and other credit investments of middle market companies located in the United States. The Company defines high-quality as investments deemed by the Adviser, after diligence and underwriting, to have favorable risk-reward characteristics including, but not limited to, a low probability of default, favorable investment terms, and an appropriate capital structure to companies of high creditworthiness with stable cash flow generation. The Company may also seek to invest in the subordinated debt and equity, including warrants, options, convertible instruments, of middle market companies. 
 On August 25, 2021, we formed a wholly-owned blocker entity, Onex Direct Lending BDC Blocker LLC, which holds certain of our portfolio equity investments. On September 21, 2021, we formed a wholly-owned, special-purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, Onex Direct Lending BDC SPV, LLC, which holds certain of our portfolio loan investments that are used as collateral for the debt financing facility with Soci t G n rale. On December 13, 2022, we formed a wholly-owned entity, Connect America OFDL BDC Holdings, LLC, which holds certain of our portfolio equity investments. 
 On October 1, 2021, we closed on our initial private offering and commenced operations. We conduct private offerings of our common shares to accredited investors and non-U.S. persons pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us. 
 We are externally managed by Onex Credit Advisor, LLC, a subsidiary of Onex Corporation, as investment adviser. The Adviser also serves as our administrator and provides administrative services necessary for us to operate. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 The principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income or loss and net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments. Net investment income or loss is the difference between our income from interest, distributions, fees, and other investment income and our operating expenses, including interest expense. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for any non-U.S. dollar denominated investment transactions. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized appreciation or depreciation on foreign currency for any non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.

Table of Contents 

We primarily generate revenue in the form of interest income from our investments in debt investments that consist primarily of senior and junior secured loans. Our debt investments are spread across multiple industries and geographic locations and, as such, we are broadly exposed to market conditions and business environments. As a result, although our investments are exposed to market risks, we continuously seek to limit concentration of exposure in any particular sector or issuer. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to 10 years, but the expected average life of such securities is generally between three and five years. The loans in which we invest will generally bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark, such as SOFR, or an alternate base rate. In addition, some of our investments may provide for PIK interest. Such amounts of accrued PIK interest are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally become due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. To a lesser extent, we may also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we anticipate holding. In addition, we may generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments will be recognized when earned. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees, if any, and other expenses under the Investment Advisory Agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees will compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. 
 We reimburse the Administrator for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including the Adviser s portion of the compensation and related expenses for certain personnel who provide administrative services. Such services include, among other things, clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services, investor relations, performing or overseeing the performance of our corporate operations (which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC), assisting us in calculating the net asset value per share, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, compliance monitoring and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. 
 We will also bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including but not limited to: 
 the cost of our organization and the offering; 

the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 

the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of our common shares and other securities; 

fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager or placement agent agreements, if any; 

administration fees payable under the Administration Agreement and any sub-administration agreements, including related expenses, such as our allocable portion of compensation, overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations; 

debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; 

costs of hedging; 

expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 

federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies;

independent trustees fees and expenses including certain travel expenses; 

costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration and listing fees, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing;

Table of Contents 

the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to shareholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any shareholder or trustee meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; 

commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 

research and market data; 

fidelity bond, trustees and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 

fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; 

costs of winding up our affairs; 

costs incurred by either the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement; 

extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and 

costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. 

We are obligated to reimburse the Adviser for expense payments made by the Adviser to us in connection with the Expense Support Agreement following any calendar quarter in which we have available operating funds. The amount of the reimbursement payment for any calendar quarter will be equal to the lesser of (i) the excess operating funds in such calendar quarter, and (ii) the aggregate amount of all expense payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser. 
 In addition, we and our Administrator have contracted with U.S. Bank N.A. to provide custodial and various accounting and administrative services, including but not limited to, preparing preliminary financial information for review by the Adviser, maintaining accounting and corporate books and records, processing trade information provided by us and performing testing in respect to RIC compliance. 
 We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods. 
 Leverage 
 The amount of leverage we intend to use in any period depends on a number of factors, including cash on-hand available for investing, the cost of financing, general economic and market conditions. We are permitted to incur indebtedness as long as immediately after such incurrence we have an asset coverage ratio of at least 150 . 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in 41 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of 503.4 million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount of non-qualifying assets to total assets was approximately 7.1 and 5.8 , respectively.

Net income can vary substantially from period-to-period due to various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, comparisons of net increase in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income is primarily dependent on the composition and credit quality of our investment portfolio. Generally, we expect our debt investments to generate predictable, recurring interest income in accordance with the contractual terms of each loan. We expect that investment income will vary based on a number of factors including the pace of our capital deployment and repayments. Corporate equity securities may pay a dividend and may increase in value for which a gain may be recognized; generally, such dividend payments and gains are less predictable than interest income on our loan portfolio. 
 Investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have generated interest income, including PIK, of 13.7 million and 16.9 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have generated interest income, including PIK, of 45.8 million and 48.7 million, respectively. Such revenues represent cash interest earned as well as non-cash income consisting of accretion of original issue discounts and PIK. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized. The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the principal balance of income-producing investments, multiplied by the contractual interest rates of our investments. Interest income decreased primarily as a result of the unscheduled paydowns and repricings of certain investments in our portfolio. The average position size of our portfolio and weighted average yield of our portfolio at par at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

Fee income, included in other income, is transaction based, and typically consists of amendment and consent fees, prepayment fees, structuring fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees. Any such fees generated will be recognized as earned. We expect the dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases.

Total expenses, including reimbursement of expense support to the Adviser, were 6.7 million and 8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total expenses, including reimbursement of expense support to the Adviser, were 23.3 million and 27.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Prior to July 1, 2023, we paid our Adviser a management fee quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. Beginning on July 1, 2023, we pay our Adviser a management fee quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of our net assets as of the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter; provided that the management fee shall not be greater than 1.25 of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. We also pay our Adviser an incentive fee that consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. The income component of the incentive fee will be the amount, if positive, equal to 15.0 , with respect to each Legacy Fee Quarter, and 12.5 , with respect to each Current Fee Quarter, of the aggregate net investment income before incentive compensation earned for the most recent calendar quarter and the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of operations), less aggregate income incentive compensation previously paid and/or waived with respect to the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant trailing twelve quarters. The income component of the incentive fee is subject to a 7.0 hurdle on our net assets at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter and subject to a cap of 15.0 during the relevant Legacy Fee Quarters and 12.5 during the relevant Current Fee Quarters of the cumulative net return comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters. The capital gains component of the incentive fee will be the amount, if positive, equal to 15.0 , prior to October 1, 2023, and 12.5 , beginning October 1, 2023, of the aggregate realized capital gains (computed net of realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation, if any) for the most recent calendar quarter and the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of calendar quarters that have occurred since commencement of the fund), less capital gains incentive compensation previously paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant trailing twelve quarters. We reimburse our Administrator for the allocable portion of the Adviser s overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser and requested to be reimbursed by the Adviser in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs. 
 Interest expense under the SPV Facility is based on the average debt outstanding. Interest expense increased primarily due to the increase in average principal amount of debt outstanding and weighted average interest rate as a result of the increase in SOFR. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reimbursed the adviser 0 and 0.5 million, respectively, and the remaining balance of 0.9 million was permanently waived by the Adviser. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Adviser voluntarily waived incentive fees totaling 0 and 0.9 million, respectively.

We expect our operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase in the next several quarters because of the anticipated growth in the size of our asset base. We expect operating expenses as a percentage of our total assets to decrease during periods of asset growth.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency of 10.4 thousand and (0.3) million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency of (19.7) thousand and 0, respectively. 
 Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 1.3 million and 6.7 million or 0.12 and 0.58 per share, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 12.7 million and 21.3 million or 1.20 and 1.77 per share, respectively. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are generated from the net proceeds received from the issuance of our common shares from private placement offerings, as well as from proceeds from principal repayments, income earned on investments and cash equivalents, and borrowings from the credit facilities. We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from future offerings of shares of our common shares, future borrowings and cash flows from operations. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities or increase the size of existing facilities to borrow funds to make investments, including before we have fully invested the net proceeds from our private placement offering, to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred shares if immediately after the borrowing or issuance our ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred shares, is at least 150 . As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 192.6 . We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage limitation under the 1940 Act and the asset coverage limitation under our credit facility to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund. 
 The primary uses of cash, including the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of our common shares, are for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, if any, cash distributions to our shareholders, and the cost of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024 we had 43.3 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand, plus 79.0 million and 80.0 million available to us under our borrowing facilities with Soci t G n rale and Onex Credit Finance II Corporation, a subsidiary of the ultimate parent entity of the Adviser, respectively, which is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the foreseeable future. However, as the impact of current inflationary pressure on the economy and our business evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. A continued worldwide disruption due to inflationary pressures could materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, financial condition, capitalization, and capital investments. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. 
 Equity 
 We are authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares at 0.001 par value per share.

In the first quarter of 2023, we began offering, and on a quarterly basis, intend to continue offering, to repurchase common shares on such terms as may be determined by the Board in its discretion. The Board has complete discretion to determine whether we will engage in any share repurchase, and if so, the terms of such repurchase. At the discretion of the Board, we may use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares.
 
 All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Any periodic repurchase offers are subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the BDC and RIC qualification and diversification rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and the Code, respectively. While we intend to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers as described above, we are not required to do so and may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time.

Distributions and Dividend Reinvestment 
 We intend to continue to make quarterly distributions to our shareholders. To maintain our RIC status and avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we generally endeavor to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our ordinary net taxable income for the calendar year; 

98.2 of our capital gains, if any, in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year; and 

any net ordinary income and net capital gains for the preceding year that were not distributed during such year and on which we do not pay corporate tax. 

44 

Table of Contents 

We may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4 excise tax on such income, to the extent required. 
 The amount of our declared distributions, as evaluated by management and approved by our Board, is based primarily on our evaluation of our net investment income and distributable taxable income.

Borrowings 
 We use borrowed funds, known as leverage, to make investments and to attempt to increase returns to our shareholders by reducing our overall cost of capital. As a BDC, we are limited in the amount of leverage we can incur under the 1940 Act. We are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150 after such borrowing. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 192.6 and 203.7 , respectively. 
 We expect to maintain adequate liquidity and compliance with regulatory and contractual asset coverage requirements.

The weighted average interest rate on the aggregate principal amount outstanding was 7.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 7.1 for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The ratio of total principal amount of debt outstanding to shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2024 was 1.08:1.00 compared to 0.96:1.00 as of December 31, 2023. 
 SPV Facility 
 We and our consolidated subsidiary, ODL SPV, were party to the SPV Facility with Soci t G n rale, as initial lender and agent, and certain financial institutions that allowed ODL SPV to borrow up to 340.0 million. Borrowings under the SPV Facility bore interest at SOFR plus a spread of 1.75 or 2.40 based on certain conditions (or an alternative rate of interest for certain loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, Euros or Sterling). ODL SPV was obligated to pay an unused commitment fee on the unused commitment amount at rate of (1) 1.00 if the amount drawn under the SPV Facility is less than the minimum commitment usage (the Minimum Commitment Usage and (2) 0.40 if the amount drawn under the SPV Facility is greater than or equal to the Minimum Commitment Usage. The Minimum Commitment Usage is equal to (1) 0.0 for the first six months ended April 4, 2022; (2) 37.5 for the period from April 5, 2022 through June 27, 2022; (3) 75 for the period from June 28, 2022 through July 13, 2022; (4) 150.0 million for the period from July 14, 2022 through January 13, 2023; and (5) 255.0 million thereafter. The Company was also obligated to pay a fee of 0.20 per annum on the outstanding balance under the SPV Facility beginning on July 14, 2022. The SPV Facility was secured by a lien on assets held by the ODL SPV and on any payments received by ODL SPV in respect of those assets. The SPV Facility was scheduled to terminate on October 2, 2026, but on October 3, 2024, the ODL SPV terminated and repaid in full the SPV Facility. 
 SMBC Facility 
 On October 3, 2024, we and our consolidated subsidiary, ODL SPV, are party to the SMBC Facility with SMBC, as initial lender and as the administrative agent and as the collateral agent, that allows ODL SPV to borrow up to 300.0 million (which consists of 300.0 million of revolving commitments), which may be increased up to a maximum facility amount of 1.5 billion subject to the requirements set forth in the SMBC Facility, including lender consent. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the SMBC Facility, advances (i) during the reinvestment period will bear interest at SOFR plus a spread of 1.65 or 2.30 per annum with respect to SOFR advances and will bear interest at the base rate plus a spread of 0.65 or 1.30 per annum with respect to base rate advances and (ii) after the reinvestment period will bear interest at SOFR plus a spread of 2.15 or 2.80 per annum with respect to SOFR advances and will bear interest at the base rate plus a spread of 1.15 or 1.80 per annum with respect to base rate advances. ODL SPV will also pay an unused fee of at a rate of 0.35 per annum on or prior to the twelve-month anniversary of the closing date and 0.50 per annual after the twelve-month anniversary of the closing date. ODL SPV will also pay a make-whole premium at a rate of 1.00 prior to the one-year anniversary of the closing date or 0.50 prior to the two-year anniversary of the closing date of the maximum facility amount or of the reduced or terminated unused amount of the SMBC Facility based on certain conditions. The SMBC Facility is secured by a lien on assets held by the ODL SPV and on any payments received by ODL SPV in respect to those assets. The SMBC Facility provides for the ability to draw and redraw revolving loans under the SMBC Facility through October 3, 2027, unless the revolving commitments are terminated sooner in the SMBC Facility. The reinvestment period end date (after which no borrowings may be drawn under the SMBC Facility) and the maturity date under the SMBC Facility are October 3, 2027 and October 3, 2029, respectively, unless otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. 
 Revolving Loan Agreement 
 On September 8, 2022, we entered into the Revolving Onex Loan with the Onex Entity, whereby the Onex Entity could advance an Onex Loan to us with a maximum aggregate outstanding principal amount of 80.0 million and a maturity date with respect to each Onex Loan of the day falling two years after the funding of such Onex Loan. On May 5, 2023, we terminated the Revolving Onex Loan and entered into the Revolving OCF II Loan, whereby OCF II may advance an Onex Loan II to us with a maximum aggregate outstanding principal amount of 80.0 million and a maturity date with respect to each OCF II Loan of the day falling two years after the funding of such OCF II Loan. We are required to meet certain criteria, including a leverage ratio threshold, before OCF II is obligated to make a loan to us. The Revolving OCF II Loan is intended to provide us with the ability to fund investments, pay related costs and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. Amounts drawn under an OCF II Loan will bear interest at SOFR plus a spread of 2.60 . 
 Related Party Transactions 
 We have entered into certain contracts with affiliated or related parties. In particular, we entered into (1) an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser to provide us with investment advisory services under which we pay our Adviser an annual base management fee based on our total assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, and incentive fees based on our performance and (2) an administrative agreement with the Administrator to perform (or oversee, or arrange for, the performance of) the administrative services necessary to enable us to operate and under which we reimburse the Administrator for administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. See Note 3. Related Party Transactions Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement for a description of our obligations under these agreements. We also entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser, whereby 
 46 

Table of Contents 

the Adviser may elect to pay certain of our expenses from time to time, which we will be obligated to reimburse to the Adviser if certain conditions are met. We are obligated to reimburse the Adviser for expense payments made by the Adviser to us in connection with the Expense Support Agreement following any calendar quarter in which we have available operating funds. The amount of the reimbursement payment for any calendar quarter will be equal to the lesser of (i) the excess operating funds in such calendar quarter, and (ii) the aggregate amount of all expense payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser. See Note 3. Related Party Transactions Expense Support Agreement for a description of our obligations under this agreement. We also entered into the Revolving Onex Loan with the Onex Entity, whereby the Onex Entity could advance amounts to us with a maximum aggregate outstanding principal amount of 80.0 million and a maturity date with respect to each Onex Loan of the day falling two years after the funding of such Onex Loan. On May 5, 2023, we terminated the Revolving Onex Loan and entered into the Revolving OCF II Loan, whereby OCF II may advance an Onex Loan II to us with a maximum aggregate outstanding principal amount of 80.0 million and a maturity date with respect to each OCF II Loan of the day falling two years after the funding of such OCF II Loan. We are required to meet certain criteria, including a leverage ratio threshold, before OCF II is obligated to make a loan to us. The Revolving OCF II Loan is intended to provide us with the ability to fund investments, pay related costs and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. Amounts drawn under the OCF II Loan will bear interest at SOFR plus a spread of 2.60 . 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 From time-to-time we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the needs of our investment in portfolio companies. Such instruments include commitments to extend credit and may involve, in varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of amounts recognized on our balance sheet. Prior to extending such credit, we attempt to limit our credit risk by conducting extensive due diligence, obtaining collateral where necessary and negotiating appropriate financial covenants. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had the following outstanding commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, complex, or subjective judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Our critical accounting policies are those applicable to the basis of presentation, valuation of investments, and certain revenue recognition matters as discussed below. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, Significant Accounting Policies Investments, contained elsewhere herein. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 The most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. 
 Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is (1) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and (2) for all other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, as valuation designee, pursuant to procedures approved by our Board. The Board has designated the Adviser as its valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, and in that role the Adviser is responsible for performing fair value determinations relating to all of our investments, including periodically assessing and managing any material valuation risks and establishing and applying fair value methodologies, in accordance with valuation policies and procedures that have been approved by the Board. Although the Board designated our Adviser as valuation designee, the Board ultimately is responsible for fair value determinations under the 1940 Act. 
 Our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio based on the nature of the security, the market for the security and other considerations including the financial performance and enterprise value of the portfolio company. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the Adviser determined values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments, and the differences could be material. 
 Pursuant to ASC 946: Financial Services Investment Companies ASC 946 ), we reflect our investments on our balance sheet at their determined fair value with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of unrealized gains or losses on our statements of operations. Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell the investments in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., the exit price). 
 See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the additional information about the level of market observability associated with investments carried at fair value. 
 We follow the provisions of ASC 820, which among other matters, requires enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value. This standard defines fair value and establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This fair value definition focuses on an exit price in the principle, or most advantageous market, and prioritizes, within a measurement of fair value, the use of market-based inputs (which may be weighted or adjusted for relevance, reliability and specific attributes relative to the subject investment) over entity-specific inputs. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 820, the FASB has issued various staff positions clarifying the initial standard (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements: Significant Accounting Policies Investments ). 
 We classify the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy as defined by current accounting guidance: 
 48 

Table of Contents 

Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible to the Company at the measurement date. 

Level 2 Valuations are based on similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable. 

Level 3 Valuations are based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models incorporating significant unobservable inputs, such as discounted cash flow models and other similar valuation techniques. The valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities generally requires significant management judgment due to the inability to observe inputs to valuation. 

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the average bid and ask prices of such market quotes, which are generally obtained from independent pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers. To validate market quotes, we will utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are deemed not to represent fair value, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, in accordance with a valuation policy approved by the Board and a consistently applied valuation process, which includes input from management and independent valuation firms that have been engaged to assist in the valuation of portfolio investments without readily available market quotations. Accordingly, such investments go through our multi-step valuation process as described below. Investments purchased within the quarter before the valuation date and debt investments with remaining maturities of 60 days or less may each be valued at cost with interest accrued or discount accreted/premium amortized to the date of maturity (although they are typically valued at available market quotations), unless such valuation, in the judgment of the Adviser, does not represent fair value. 
 The Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 The valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued using certain inputs, among others, provided by the Adviser's investment professionals that are responsible for the portfolio investment; 

Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the Adviser s valuation committee; 

At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. In each case, our independent third party valuation firm considers observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations for such investments; and 

The Adviser then reviews the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment. 

As part of the valuation process, the Adviser may consider other information and may use valuation methods including but not limited to (i) market quotes for similar investments, (ii) recent trading activity, (iii) discounting forecasted cash flows of the investment, (iv) models that consider the implied yields from comparable debt, (v) third party appraisals, (vi) sale negotiations and purchase offers received from independent parties and (vii) estimated value of underlying assets to be received in any liquidation or restructuring. 
 As part of the valuation process, we will primarily use the income approach by using a present value technique that discounts the estimated contractual cash flows. Discount rates applied to estimated contractual cash flows for an underlying asset vary by specific investment, industry, priority and nature of the debt security and are assessed relative to leveraged loan and high-yield bond indices at the valuation date. The use of market indices as part of the valuation methodology is subject to adjustment for many factors, including priority, collateral used as security, structure, performance and other quantitative and qualitative attributes of the asset being valued. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity or debt sale occurs, the Board or its delegates will consider whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. 
 When we determine our NAV as of the last day of a month that is not also the last day of a calendar quarter, we intend to update the value of securities with reliable market quotations to the most recent market quotation. For securities without reliable market quotations, the Adviser s valuation team will generally value such assets at the most recent quarterly valuation unless the Adviser determines that a significant observable change has occurred since the most recent quarter end with respect to the investment (which determination may be as a result of a material event at a portfolio company, material change in market spreads, secondary market transaction in the securities of an investment or otherwise). If the Adviser s valuation team determines such a change has occurred with respect to one or more investments, the Adviser s valuation team will determine whether to update the value for each relevant investment, using positive assurance from an independent valuation firm where applicable in accordance with our valuation policy, pursuant to authority delegated by the Board.

A determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates and depends on the facts and circumstances present at each valuation date. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investment may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment, including the impact of changes in broader market indices and credit spreads, and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will not accrue PIK interest if management determines that the PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount, and market discount are capitalized and then we amortize such amounts as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We further record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. 
 Income Taxes 
 We elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. To qualify for and maintain qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements, and make certain minimum distributions to shareholders. We will be subject to a 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on undistributed income. See Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies Income Taxes .

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualit ative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Our business activities contain elements of market risks. We consider our principal market risks to be fluctuations in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. Managing these risks is essential to our business. Accordingly, we have systems and procedures designed to identify and analyze our risks, to establish appropriate policies and thresholds and to continually monitor these risks and thresholds by means of administrative and information technology systems and other policies and processes. 
 Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of interest rates, inflation, the war between Russia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other geopolitical events has introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effect of the volatility could materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. For additional information concerning these risks and their potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Structure General economic conditions could adversely affect the performance of our investments, Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Structure The failure of major financial institutions, namely banks, or sustained financial market illiquidity, could adversely affect our and/or our portfolio companies businesses and results of operations and Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Structure The ongoing armed conflicts as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas may have a material adverse impact on us and our portfolio companies. in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024. We are subject to financial market risks, including interest rate risk and valuation risk. Accordingly, we have systems and procedures designed to identify and analyze our risks, to establish appropriate policies and thresholds and to continually monitor these risks and thresholds by means of administrative and information technology systems and other policies and processes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing debt and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. 
 We intend to continue to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 98.9 and 100 , respectively, of the debt investments based on par value in our portfolio were at floating rates indexed to SOFR, Prime, or FFR, as was our outstanding debt. 
 The following table shows the estimated annualized impact on net investment income based on hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024 (considering interest rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments and assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure).

Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments that could affect our net income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under supervision of the Board in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Certain of our portfolio companies are in industries that have been impacted by inflation. Recent inflationary pressures have increased the costs of labor, energy and raw materials and have adversely affected consumer spending, economic growth and our portfolio companies operations. If such portfolio companies are unable to pass any increases in their costs of operations along to their customers, it could adversely affect their operating results and impact their ability to pay interest and principal on our loans, particularly if interest rates rise in response to inflation. In addition, any projected future decreases in our portfolio companies operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future realized or unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets resulting from operations. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has raised, and may in the future continue to raise, certain benchmark interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. 
 Item 4. Contro ls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of various members of management, including its Chief Executive Officer CEO and its Chief Financial Officer CFO ), has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equ ity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 There were no unregistered sales of our equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 In the first quarter of 2023, the Company began offering, and on a quarterly basis, intends to continue offering, to repurchase up to 5 of the Company s outstanding shares as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. Although the Company intends to offer to repurchase up to 5 of its common shares outstanding in each quarter, the Board has in the past, and may in the future, increase the size of the tender offer, if the Board determines such an increase to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. The Board has complete discretion to determine whether we will offer to repurchase any of our common shares, and if so, the terms of such repurchase. At the discretion of the Board, we may use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares. 
 All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Any periodic repurchase offers are subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the BDC and RIC qualification and diversification rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and the Code, respectively. While we intend to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers as described above, we are not required to do so and may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. 
 The following table presents the share repurchases completed during the three months ended September 30, 2024:
