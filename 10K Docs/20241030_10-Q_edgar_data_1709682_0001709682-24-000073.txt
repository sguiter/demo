 Rental revenue is primarily comprised of revenues from rental agreements and freight charges billed to customers.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had net receivables related to rental contracts and other of million and million, respectively. 
 The Company manages credit risk associated with its accounts receivable at the customer level. Because the same customers generate the revenues that are accounted for under both Topic 606 and Topic 842, the discussions below address how credit risk and the Company's allowance for credit losses impact the Company's total revenues. 
 The Company s allowance for credit losses reflects its estimate of the amount of receivables that it will be unable to collect. The estimated losses are based upon a review of outstanding receivables, the related aging, including specific accounts if deemed necessary, and on the Company s historical collection experience. The estimated losses are calculated using the loss rate method based upon a review of outstanding receivables, related aging, and historical collection experience. The Company's estimates reflect changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers, and, as a result, the Company may be required to increase or decrease its allowance.

 The discount rate used to measure the present value of the projected future cash flows is set using a weighted-average cost of capital method that considers market and industry data, as well as our specific risk factors that are likely to be considered by a market participant. The weighted-average cost of capital is our estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.

 As of September 30, 2024, borrowing availability under the ABL Facility was million, and outstanding standby letters of credit were million. 
 ABL Facility 
 On August 9, 2024, the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries entered into an amendment to its asset-based revolving credit agreement (the ABL Amendment, and the credit agreement as amended, supplemented or modified, including by the ABL Amendment, the ABL Credit Agreement ), to increase the borrowing capacity under its first lien senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Facility from million to million, and extend the maturity date of the agreement from April 1, 2026 to August 9, 2029, or, if earlier, the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Company s existing senior notes or any debt that refinances such existing notes.

The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same period in 2023, was primarily due to state and local income tax updates enacted during the current period. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15 effective on January 1, 2024. While the US has not adopted the Pillar Two rules, effective June 20, 2024, Canada has enacted legislation formally adopting Pillar Two. As currently designed, Pillar Two will ultimately apply to our worldwide operations. Considering we do not have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum, these rules are not expected to materially increase our global tax liability. We will continue to monitor US and global legislative activities related to Pillar Two. 
 
 million and million escrow accounts, respectively. 
 From time to time, the Company is audited by state and local taxing authorities. These audits typically focus on the Company s withholding of state-specific sales tax and rental-related taxes. 
 Custom Truck LP s withholdings of federal excise taxes for each of the four quarterly periods during 2015 are currently under audit by the IRS. The IRS issued an assessment on October 28, 2020 in an aggregate amount of million for the 2015 periods, alleging that certain types of sold equipment are not eligible for the Mobile Machinery Exemption set forth in the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ). An appeal was filed on January 28, 2021. Based on management s understanding of the facts and circumstances, including the relevant provisions of the Code, and historical precedent, including previous successful appeals of similar assessments in prior years, management does not believe the likelihood of a loss resulting from the IRS assessment to be probable at this time. 
 While it is not possible to predict the outcome of the foregoing matters with certainty, it is the opinion of management that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Custom Truck One Source, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries we, our, us, or the Company are engaged in the business of providing a range of products and services to customers through rentals and sales of specialty equipment, rentals and sales of aftermarket parts and services related to the specialty equipment, and repair, maintenance and customization services related to that equipment. 
 We are a specialty equipment provider to the electric utility transmission and distribution, telecommunications, rail, forestry, waste management and other infrastructure-related industries in North America. Our core business relates to our new equipment inventory and rental fleet of specialty equipment that is utilized by service providers in infrastructure development and improvement work. We offer our specialized equipment to a diverse customer base, including utilities and contractors, for the maintenance, repair, upgrade, and installation of critical infrastructure assets, including distribution and transmission electric lines, telecommunications networks and rail systems, as well as for lighting and signage. We rent, produce, sell and service a broad range of new and used equipment, including bucket trucks, digger derricks, dump trucks, cranes, service trucks, and heavy-haul trailers. We manage the business in three reporting segments: Equipment Rental Solutions ERS ), Truck and Equipment Sales TES and Aftermarket Parts and Services APS ). 
 
 Financial and Performance Measures 
 Financial Measures 
 Revenue As a full-service equipment provider, we generate revenue through renting, selling, assembling, upfitting, and servicing new and used heavy-duty trucks and cranes, as well as the sale of related parts. We also sell and rent specialized tools on an individual basis and in kits. Rental revenue is primarily comprised of revenues from rental agreements and freight charges billed to customers. The Company records changes in estimated collectability directly against rental revenue. Equipment sales revenue reflects the value of vocational trucks and other equipment sold to customers. Parts and service revenue is derived from maintenance and repair services, light upfit services, and parts, tools and accessories sold directly to customers. Rental revenue excludes active rental contracts which qualify to be accounted for as sales-type leases. 
 Cost of rental revenue Cost of rental revenue reflects repairs and maintenance costs of rental equipment, parts costs, labor and other overheads related to maintaining the rental fleet, and freight associated with the shipping of rental equipment. 
 Depreciation of rental equipment Depreciation of rental equipment is comprised of depreciation expense on the rental fleet. We allocate the cost of rental equipment generally over the rentable life of the equipment. The depreciation allocation is based upon estimated lives ranging from five to seven years. The cost of equipment is depreciated to an estimated residual value using the straight-line method. 
 Cost of equipment sales Cost of equipment sales reflects production and inventory costs associated with new units sold, parts costs, labor and other overheads related to production, and freight associated with the shipping and receiving of equipment and parts. Cost of equipment sales also includes the net book value of rental units sold, including active rental contracts which qualify to be accounted for as sales-type leases. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include sales compensation, fleet licensing fees and corporate expenses, including salaries, stock-based compensation expense, insurance, advertising costs, professional services, fees earned on customer arranged financing, gains or losses resulting from insurance settlements, and information technology costs. 
 Amortization and non-rental depreciation Amortization expense relates to intangible assets such as customer lists, trade names, etc. Non-rental depreciation expense reflects the depreciation of property and equipment that is not part of the rental fleet. 
 Transaction expenses and other Transaction expenses and other include expenses directly related to the acquisition of businesses. These expenses generally are comprised of travel and out-of-pocket expenses and legal, accounting and valuation or appraisal fees incurred in connection with pre- and post-closure activities. We also include costs and expenses associated with post-acquisition integration activities related to the acquired businesses. 
 Financing and other expense (income) Financing and other expense (income) reflects the financing expense (income) associated with lease agreements qualifying to be accounted for as a sales-type lease, foreign currency gains and losses related to our Canadian 

operations, as well as other miscellaneous gains or losses from non-operating activities. Also included in financing and other expense (income) are the unrealized remeasurement gains and losses related to derivative financial instruments. 
 Interest expense Interest expense consists of contractual interest expense on outstanding debt obligations, floorplan financing facilities, amortization of deferred financing costs and other related financing expenses. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) We have net operating loss carryforward and disallowed interest deduction carryforward assets, which are generally available to be used to offset taxable income generated in future years. Due to limitations on the use of these carryforwards under U.S. federal and state income tax regulations, we record valuation allowances to reduce the carryforward assets to amounts that we estimate will be realized. Accordingly, income tax expense or benefit generally is comprised of changes to these valuation allowance estimates and does not reflect taxes on current period income (or tax benefit on current period losses). For these reasons, our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate. 
 Operating Metrics 
 We consider the following key operational metrics, which are consistent with those defined by the American Rental Association, when evaluating our performance and making day-to-day operating decisions: 
 Ending OEC Ending original equipment cost OEC is the original equipment cost of units at the end of the measurement period. OEC represents the original equipment cost, and excludes the effect of adjustments to rental equipment fleet acquired in business combinations. OEC is the basis for calculating certain of the measures set forth below. Additionally, the pricing of our rental contracts and equipment sales prices for our equipment is based upon OEC, and we measure a rate of return from our rentals and sales using OEC. OEC is a widely used industry metric to compare fleet dollar value independent of depreciation. 
 Average OEC on rent Average OEC on rent is calculated as the weighted-average OEC on rent during the stated period. 
 Fleet utilization Fleet utilization is defined as the total number of days the rental equipment was rented during a specified period of time divided by the total number of days available during the same period and weighted based on OEC. Utilization is a measure of fleet efficiency expressed as a percentage of time the fleet is on rent and is considered to be an important indicator of the revenue generating capacity of the fleet. 
 OEC on rent yield OEC on rent yield ORY is a measure of return realized by our rental fleet during a period. ORY is calculated as rental revenue (excluding freight recovery and ancillary fees) during the stated period divided by the average OEC on rent for the same period. For periods less than 12 months, ORY is adjusted to an annualized basis. 
 Sales order backlog Sales order backlog consists of purchase orders received for customized and stock equipment. Sales order backlog should not be considered an accurate measure of future net sales. 
 
 Operating Segments 
 We operate in three reportable operating segments: Equipment Rental Solutions, Truck and Equipment Sales and Aftermarket Parts and Services. 
 Equipment Rental Solutions ERS Segment We own a broad range of new and used specialty equipment, including truck-mounted aerial lifts, cranes, service trucks, dump trucks, trailers, digger derricks and other machinery and equipment. As of September 30, 2024, this equipment (the rental fleet is comprised of approximately 10,200 units. The majority of our rental fleet can be used across a variety of end-markets, which coincides with the needs of many of our customers who operate in multiple end-markets. As is customary for equipment rental companies, we sell used equipment out of our rental fleet to end user customers. These sales are often made in response to specific customer requests. These sales offer customers an opportunity to buy well-maintained equipment with long remaining useful lives and enable us to effectively manage the age and mix of our rental fleet to match current market demand. We also employ rental purchase options RPOs on a select basis, which provide a buyout option with an established purchase price that decreases over time as rental revenue is collected. Customers are given credit against such purchase price for a portion of the amounts paid over the life of the rental, allowing customers the flexibility of a rental with the option to purchase at any time at a known price. Activities in our ERS segment consist of the rental and sale from the rental fleet of the foregoing products. 
 Truck and Equipment Sales TES Segment We offer a broad variety of new equipment for sale to be used across our end-markets, which can be modified to meet our customers specific needs. We believe that our integrated production capabilities and extensive knowledge gained over a long history of selling equipment have established us as a trusted partner for customers seeking tailored solutions with short lead times. In support of these activities, we primarily employ a direct-to-customer sales model, leveraging our dedicated sales force of industry and product managers, who are focused on driving national and local sales. We also 
 22 

opportunistically engage in the sale of used equipment purchased from third parties or received via trade-ins from new equipment sales customers. In the majority of these cases, we will sell used equipment directly to customers, rather than relying on auctions. Activities in our TES segment consist of the production and sale of new and used specialty equipment and vocational trucks, which includes equipment from leading original equipment manufacturers OEMs across our end-markets, as well as our Load King TM brand. 
 Aftermarket Parts and Services APS Segment The APS segment includes the sale of specialized aftermarket parts, including captive parts related to our Load King TM brand, used in the maintenance and repair of the equipment we sell and rent. Specialized tools, including stringing blocks, insulated hot stick, and rigging equipment, are sold or rented to our customers on an individual basis or in packaged specialty kits. We also provide truck and equipment maintenance and repair services, which are executed throughout our nationwide branch network and fleet of mobile technicians supported by our 24/7 call center based in Kansas City, Missouri.

Total Revenue - The increase in total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 is a result of higher volumes of new equipment sales due to the robust demand for our products in the forestry and utility end-markets, partially offset by decreased rental revenue due to lower utilization and a decline in average OEC on rent. 
 The decrease in total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was the result of lower rental revenue as described above, as well as lower volume of used equipment sales. The Company continues to be impacted by factors affecting its customers, including their supply chain constraints, environmental, regulatory and customer financing factors that have impacted the timing of transmission job starts. These delays contributed to both lower rental revenue and rental asset sales during the year. 
 Cost of Revenue, Excluding Rental Equipment Depreciation - The increase in cost of revenue, excluding rental equipment depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was driven primarily by the increase in equipment sales volume during the quarter. 
 The decrease in cost of revenue, excluding rental equipment depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was driven primarily by the decrease in equipment sales volume during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation of Rental Equipment - Depreciation of our rental equipment increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, as a result of higher rental equipment levels. 
 Operating Expenses - Operating expenses remained flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Operating expenses increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in general and administrative expenses due to increased headcount and wages, increased insurance due to higher inventory levels and rental assets, and additional expense associated with various information technology projects. 
 Total Other Expense - Other expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the increase in interest expense from variable rate debt and floor plan financing liabilities. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) - Income tax expense (benefit) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was (0.6) million and 0.5 million, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of 3.4 and (0.9) . Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.4 million and 2.7 million, respectively, at an effective tax rate of 4.5 and 7.2 . The changes in the effective tax rates were primarily due to state and local income tax updates enacted during the current periods. 
 Net Income (loss) - The change in net income to a net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily the result of decreased gross profit and higher interest expense on variable-rate debt and variable-rate floor plan liabilities. 
 
 Operating Metrics 
 We principally evaluate operational performance based on the following metrics: ending OEC, average OEC on rent, fleet utilization, and OEC on rent yield. We also report sales order backlog related to our customers orders for new vocational heavy duty trucks as an indicator of the demand environment for our products.

 Cost of Revenue - Cost of revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, as a result of higher costs of materials. 
 26 

Gross Profit - The decrease in gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily driven by the decrease in tools and accessories rentals with an increase in costs of materials driving gross profit down. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under revolving credit facilities as described below. We believe that our liquidity sources and operating cash flows are sufficient to address our operating, debt service and capital requirements, including investments in our rental fleet, over the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, we had 8.4 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to 10.3 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 627.9 million and 552.4 million of outstanding borrowings under our ABL Facility, respectively. During August 2024, the ABL Facility was amended to, among other things, provide an additional 200.0 million of borrowing capacity and extend the maturity date to August 9, 2029. Availability under the senior secured credit facility was 319.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and based on our borrowing base, we have an additional 190.9 million of suppressed availability that we can potentially utilize by upsizing our existing facility.

 The ABL Facility contains customary negative covenants for transactions of this type, including covenants that, among other things, limit the Company and its restricted subsidiaries ability to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem stock, or make other distributions; repurchase, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of Company s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends; create liens; transfer or sell assets; consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company s assets; enter into certain transactions with the Company s affiliates; and designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain exceptions, as well as a restrictive covenant applicable to each Specified Floor Plan Company (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) limiting its ability to own certain assets and engage in certain lines of business. The covenants governing the payment of dividends and making other distributions are based upon a combination of fixed amounts, percentages of Adjusted EBITDA or upon multiple pro forma measures depending on the purpose of any such dividend payments or distributions the Company and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to make. Unlimited dividends under the ABL Facility may be permitted so long as, on a pro forma basis, distribution conditions (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement governing the ABL Facility) are satisfied. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s distribution conditions were satisfied and, as a result, the Company determined there were no restrictions on distributions by the ABL Credit Agreement. 
 The 5.50 senior secured second lien notes due 2029 (the 2029 Secured Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the Indenture which contains covenants that limit the Company s (and certain of its subsidiaries ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends, redeem stock, or make other distributions; (iii) make other restricted payments or investments; (iv) create liens on assets; (v) transfer or sell assets; (vi) create restrictions on payment of dividends or other amounts by the Company to its restricted subsidiaries; (vii) engage in mergers or consolidations; (viii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; or (ix) designate the Company s subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. The covenants governing the payment of dividends and making other distributions are based upon a combination of fixed amounts, percentages of Adjusted EBITDA or upon multiple pro forma measures depending on the purpose of any such dividend payments or distributions the Company and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to make. Unlimited dividends, under the Indenture, may be made so long as after giving effect to making the dividends, the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio would be no greater than 5.00 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s Consolidated Total Debt Ratio was not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 and, as a result, the Company determined there were no restrictions on distributions by the Indenture. For further information on the ABL Facility and Indenture, see Note 9: Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on March 7, 2024. 
 The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA calculated in accordance with Consolidated EBITDA as that term is used in the ABL Credit Agreement and the Indenture. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income, as adjusted for provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired rental fleet (the non-cash purchase accounting impact ), business acquisition and merger-related costs, including integration, the impact of accounting for certain of our rental contracts with customers that are accounted for under GAAP as a sales-type lease and stock compensation expense. 
 The Company presents Net Leverage Ratio, which is equivalent to Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio in our ABL Credit Agreement and Consolidated Total Debt Ratio in the Indenture, is defined as Net Debt over Adjusted EBITDA for the previous twelve-month period last twelve months, or LTM ). Net debt is defined as total debt (calculated as current and long-term debt, excluding deferred financing fees, plus current and long-term finance lease obligations) minus cash and cash equivalents. 
 27 

Our creditors utilize Adjusted EBITDA and Net Leverage Ratio to assess our compliance with the restrictive covenants in the ABL Credit Agreement and the Indenture. Neither Adjusted EBITDA or Net Leverage Ratio is calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not conform to the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA or Net Leverage Ratio used by other companies. Neither Adjusted EBITDA or Net leverage Ratio should be considered as a substitute for a measure of our financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The following table provides the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA pursuant to the ABL Credit Agreement and the Indenture.

Historical Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in 000s) 2024 2023 Net cash flow from operating activities 39,934 (2,706) Net cash flow for investing activities (164,883) (145,612) Net cash flow from financing activities 122,779 142,557 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents Net change in cash and cash equivalents (1,871) (5,567) 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 8.4 million, a decrease of 1.9 million from December 31, 2023. Generally, we manage our cash flow by using any excess cash, after considering our working capital and capital expenditure needs, including paying down the outstanding balance under our ABL Facility, and availability under our credit facilities. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash from operating activities was 39.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 2.7 million in the same period of 2023. The cash provided by operating activities in the current period is the result of the increase in floorplan trade financing for inventory purchases. 
 Cash Flows for Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 164.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 145.6 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from sales and disposals of rental equipment of 21.8 million. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 122.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 142.6 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock of 9.0 million and a decrease in proceeds, net of repayments, from floor plan financing and long-term debt arrangements of 5.8 million.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances and reevaluate our estimates and judgments as appropriate. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. For a complete discussion of our significant critical accounting estimates, see the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Except as discussed below, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Goodwill and the Evaluation of Goodwill Impairment 
 Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired and goodwill is assigned to each of our reporting units, which are ERS, TES and APS. The following presents the amount of goodwill by reporting unit as of June 30, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 
 (in 000s) 
 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 ERS 498,611 498,549 498,808 TES 167,307 167,307 167,307 APS 39,364 39,364 37,896 Total 705,282 705,220 704,011 
 
 We perform our assessment of goodwill impairment utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test, and we perform our test at least annually. Our annual assessment date is October 1 and we perform impairment tests in interim periods (e.g., other than October 1) when factors are identified that could indicate goodwill of any of our reporting units may be impaired. Examples of such factors may include a significant adverse change in business climate, weakness in an industry in which our reporting units operate or recent significant cash or operating losses with expectations that those losses will continue. The qualitative and quantitative impairment tests are described further below. 
 Qualitative Impairment Test The qualitative impairment test assesses company-specific, industry, market and general economic factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or we elect not to use the qualitative impairment test, a quantitative impairment test is performed. 
 Quantitative Impairment Test The quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair value of a reporting being unit being estimated by using a discounted cash flow model (the income approach that calculates fair value as the present value of expected cash flows of the reporting unit. Additionally, a market analysis is performed that encompasses an analysis of comparable publicly-traded companies (the market approach ). 
 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates that include assumptions about the reporting unit s future revenue (considering expectations about rental and sales volumes and prices as well as capital spending related to the end-markets we serve), profitability and cash flows, long-term growth rates, amount and timing of estimated capital expenditures, inflation rates, risk adjusted cost of capital, operational plans, and current and future economic conditions, among other assumptions. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a weighted combination of the income and market approaches. We believe that the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information. We use a discounted cash flow methodology for the income approach. Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specified period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted using a rate that reflects the best estimate of the risk adjusted cost of capital at each reporting unit. 
 During the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, we identified factors indicating goodwill may be impaired related to two of our reporting units, ERS and APS. The following is a discussion of the estimates and assumptions from our June 30, 2024 interim impairment test for the ERS and APS reporting units: 
 31 

The risk adjusted cost of capital varies by reporting unit and was in the range of 10.0 to 10.5 and represents our estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. 
 Our projections were based on our assessment of macroeconomic variables, industry trends and market opportunities, as well as our strategic objectives and future growth plans. Revenue growth rates assumed ranged from approximately 5 to 7 for 2025 and from approximately 3 to 8 for 2026 and beyond. 
 As a result of completing our June 30, 2024, interim quantitative impairment test, we determined that the fair value of the ERS and APS reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 23 and 17 , respectively. While there is no bright line to determine whether or not a reporting unit s fair value is substantially in excess of its carrying amount cushion ), significant adverse changes in business climate, weakness in an industry in which our reporting units operate (for example, electric utility T D, telecom, rail and general infrastructure) or significant cash or operating losses and changes in expectations of profitability could reduce the amounts of cushion applicable to our reporting units and result in impairment of one or more of our reporting units goodwill. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we continued to evaluate whether factors indicate goodwill of any of our reporting units may be impaired and we did not identify any triggering factors that could indicate goodwill impairment. As a result, we concluded another interim test was not necessary. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest rate risk 
 We are subject to interest rate market risk in connection with our long-term debt. Our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under the ABL Credit Facility and our floor plan financing arrangements. Interest rate changes generally impact the amount of our interest payments and, therefore, our future net income and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,550.4 million aggregate principal amount of variable rate debt, consisting of the balance outstanding under floor plan financing and the ABL Facility. Holding other variables constant, each one-eighth percentage point increase or decrease in the applicable interest rates would correspondingly change our interest expense under floor plan financing and the ABL Facility by approximately 1.9 million on an annual basis. 
 We, from time to time, may manage a portion of our risks from exposures to fluctuations in interest rates as part of our risk management program through the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings and cash flows caused by fluctuations in the interest rates of our variable-rate debt. We do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure. 
 Foreign currency exchange rate risk 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 33.9 million of revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. Each 100-basis point increase or decrease in the average Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate for the year would have correspondingly changed our revenues by approximately 0.4 million on an annual basis. We do not currently hedge our exchange rate exposure. 
 32 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Inadequate Business Process Controls 
 On April 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Custom Truck LP, which resulted in a significant change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. We are in the process of completing the integration of policies, processes, people, technology and operations for the combined company. As part of this integration, we identified deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls associated with the control activities component of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO framework. 
 During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, we identified control deficiencies related to all of our business process controls (automated and manual), including management review controls. These control deficiencies could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that may not be prevented or detected. 
 Accordingly, these deficiencies constituted a pervasive material weakness. The pervasive material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to our consolidated financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. 
 (b) Status of Remediation of the Pervasive Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have devoted and continue to devote substantial resources and effort to remediating the pervasive material weakness identified in fiscal year 2021. 
 Additionally, management is in the process of designing, implementing and monitoring all business process controls (automated and manual), including management review controls, that are relevant to all financial statement accounts and disclosures. This pervasive material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable controls are designed and operating effectively for a sufficient period of time, as supported by management s testing results. 
 (c) Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the ongoing remediation efforts described above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

33 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We may, at any given time, be named as a defendant in certain lawsuits, investigations and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these potential lawsuits, investigations and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In the opinion of management, there are no pending litigation, disputes or claims against the Company that, if decided adversely, would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 No material changes occurred to the indicated risk factors as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On August 2, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to 30 million of the Company s shares of common stock, which authorization was further increased by 25 million of shares on September 14, 2023, and increased again increased by 25 million on March 11, 2024, upon exhaustion of prior authorization. The authorization does not have an expiration date. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs.
