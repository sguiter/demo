The Company has financed its operations principally through issuance of equity securities. On May 9, 2024, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The gross proceeds of the public offering were million, before deducting the underwriter discount and other offering expenses, totaling approximately million. On July 19, 2024, the Company entered into an Open Market Agreement SM (the "Sales Agreement") with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent ("Jefferies"), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through Jefferies shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to .

Essentialis purchase price contingency liability 

Total liabilities 

Based on the terms of the Company s completed merger with Essentialis on March 7, 2017, the Company is obligated to make cash earnout payments of up to a maximum of million to the former Essentialis stockholders. The fair value of the Essentialis purchase price contingent liability is estimated using scenario-based methods based upon the Company s analysis of the likelihood of obtaining specified approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as achieving two commercial sales milestones of million and million in cumulative revenue. The Level 3 estimates are based, in part, on subjective assumptions. In determining the likelihood of this occurring, the analysis relied on published research relating to clinical development success rates. Based on management s assessment, an probability of achieving all three milestones was determined to be reasonable as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. During the periods presented, the Company has not changed the manner in which it values its Essentialis purchase price contingent liability. The Company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels within the hierarchy during the periods presented.

In the event of a change of control of the Company, the holders of unexercised warrants may present their unexercised warrants to the Company, or its successor, to be purchased by the Company, or its successor, in an amount equal to the per share value determined by the Black Scholes methodology. Since the Company may be obligated to settle the 2018 PIPE Warrants in cash, the Company classified the 2018 PIPE Warrants as long-term liabilities at their fair value and will re-measure the warrants at each balance sheet date until they are exercised or expire. Any change in the fair value is recognized as Other income (expense) in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The 2018 PIPE Warrants were either exercised prior to or expired on December 21, 2023.

In addition to base rent, the Company has agreed to reimburse the landlord for certain operating expenses under the terms of the lease. The lease commencement date was September 1, 2024 when the premises became available for occupancy and the related operating lease ROU assets and liabilities were recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Company's operating lease ROU assets, current operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities each appear as a separate line within the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. In September 2024, the Company recorded an increase to its right-of-use assets by million and an increase to its lease liability of million as a result of the June 2024 office lease.

The weighted average discount rate related to the Company's lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 was over a remaining term of months. The discount rate was determined based on estimates of the Company s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. Due to the short-term nature of the February 2024 office license agreement, the license agreement obligations are not included in the Company's right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Contingencies In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications.

shares of Preferred Stock. Public Offering of Common Stock On May 9, 2024, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The gross proceeds of the public offering were million, before deducting the underwriter discount and other offering expenses, totaling approximately million. Public Offering of Common Stock and Concurrent Private Placement of Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrants On October 2, 2023, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock at a public offering of per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The gross proceeds of the public offering were million, before deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. Concurrently, the Company also completed the closing of shares of its common stock and pre-funded warrants in a private offering pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with certain investors, including entities affiliated with existing stockholders, at a price per share of common stock equal to the public offering price of and a price per pre-funded warrant of , for total gross proceeds of approximately million. In aggregate, the Company received million of gross proceeds less offering costs of million. The Company is not required under any circumstance to settle any of the pre-funded warrants for cash, and therefore classified the pre-funded warrants as permanent equity. Securities Purchase Agreement On December 16, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for a private placement (Private Placement) with certain entities and members of management (collectively, Purchasers). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to the Purchasers warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock, at a purchase price of per warrant. The closing of the Private Placement occurred on May 8, 2023 (the Issue Date), following the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the completion of enrollment in the randomized withdrawal period of Study C602. The Company received gross proceeds of million for the sale and issuance of warrants to purchase common stock. The warrants were separated into two tranches with Tranche A Warrants with an exercise price of per share and aggregate proceeds of up to approximately million, and Tranche B Warrants with an exercise price of per share and aggregate proceeds of up to million. The Tranche A warrants were immediately exercisable and were required to be exercised within days of announcement of positive top-line data from the randomized withdrawal period of Study C602. On September 26, 2023, the Company announced positive top-line data and subsequently received million from the exercise of the Tranche A warrants. The Tranche B warrants are also immediately exercisable and expire upon the earlier of years from the date of issuance or days following receipt of FDA approval of DCCR for the treatment of PWS. Through September 30, 2024, certain investors had exercised their Tranche B warrants and the Company has received million. The receipt of the aggregate exercise price of up to million for the remaining Tranche B warrants is contingent upon the exercise of such warrants . Underwritten Public Offering On March 31, 2022, the Company sold shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share, and for certain investors, in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants (the 2022 pre-funded warrants) to purchase shares of its common stock at a public offering price per pre-funded warrant, which represents the per share public offering price for the common stock less the per share exercise price for each 2022 pre-funded warrant. The March 2022 pre-funded warrants are immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all of the March 2022 pre-funded warrants are exercised in full. Each share of common stock or March 2022 pre-funded warrant was sold together with one, immediately exercisable, common warrant (the 2022 common warrants) with a term to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share. The net proceeds of the offering were million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. The Company is not required under any circumstance to settle any of the 2022 pre-funded warrants or the 2022 common warrants for cash, and therefore classified both types of warrants as permanent equity. Through September 30, 2024, of the March 2022 common warrants had been exercised for gross proceeds of million and warrants were exercised using the cashless exercise option with proceeds to the Company. As of September 

 13 

of the March 2022 common warrants remain outstanding. All of the March 2022 pre-funded warrants were exercised in 2023 using the cashless exercise option with additional proceeds received by the Company. At the Market Offering In July 2021, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement under which the Company was able to sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time in any method permitted by law deemed to be an "at-the-market" Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement was terminated in connection with the October 2, 2023 financing.

On July 19, 2024, the Company entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell up to million of shares of its common stock, from time to time, through Jefferies. The Company will pay Jefferies a commission of of the aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares and has agreed to provide Jefferies with customary indemnification and contribution rights. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Jefferies for certain specified expenses. The Company is not obligated to sell any shares under the Sales Agreement.

Options are to be granted at an exercise price not less than fair value. For individuals holding more than of the voting rights of all classes of stock, the exercise price of an option will not be less than of fair value. Performance-based grants have vesting contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria related to the Company s commercialization of its therapeutics. The contractual term of an option is no longer than for ISOs for which the grantee owns greater than 10 of the voting power of all classes of stock and no longer than for all other options. The terms and conditions governing restricted stock units is at the sole discretion of the Board.

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include the following estimates: Expected life: The expected life of stock options represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. Due to the lack of historical exercise history, the expected life of the Company s service-based stock options has been determined utilizing the simplified method , based on the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted-average vesting period. The expected life for the performance-based options was determined based on consideration of the contractual term of the stock options, an estimate of the date the performance criteria would be met and expectations of employee behavior. 

 Risk-free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected life of the stock options.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analy sis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The interim consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in Part II Other Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors below and elsewhere in this report that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results. 
 Business Overview 
 We are focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases. Our lead candidate is DCCR (Diazoxide Choline) Extended-Release tablets, a once-daily oral tablet for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We have Fast-Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations for DCCR for the treatment of PWS in the United States (U.S.) and orphan designation for the treatment of PWS in the U.S. as well as in the European Union (E.U.). 
 DCCR has been evaluated in a Phase 3 study (C601 or DESTINY PWS), a 3-month randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study, which completed enrollment in January 2020, with 127 patients at 29 sites in the U.S. and U.K. Participants who completed treatment in DESTINY PWS were eligible to receive DCCR in a long-term open-label extension period (C602). Top line results from DESTINY PWS were announced in June 2020. Although the trial did not meet its primary endpoint of change from baseline in hyperphagia, significant improvements were observed in two of three key secondary endpoints. 
 In January 2022, the FDA recommended that additional controlled data be included in a New Drug Approval (NDA) submission and in October 2022, we initiated the RW period of Study C602. This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of DCCR in 77 patients with PWS at 17 sites in the U.S. and 5 sites in the U.K. This RW period consisted only of patients enrolled in Study C602 and did not enroll any new patients. In September 2023, we announced positive statistically significant top-line results from the RW period of Study C602. 
 In April 2024, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for DCCR, the first ever breakthrough designation for a drug being developed for PWS, in June 2024 we submitted an NDA for DCCR to the FDA, and on August 27, 2024, we announced the FDA granted Priority Review for the NDA and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of December 27, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 of our most recent Form 10-K and including the policy below. 
 Marketable Securities 
 The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale and records such assets at estimated fair value in the balance sheets, with unrealized gains and non-credit related losses that are determined to be temporary, if any, reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) within the statements of operations and comprehensive loss and as a separate component of stockholders equity. The Company classifies marketable securities with remaining maturities greater than three months but less than one year as marketable securities, and those with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term marketable securities. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method and recorded as interest income and were immaterial for all periods presented.

Revenue 
 To date, we have earned no revenue from the commercial development and sale of novel therapeutic products. 
 Research and development expense 
 Research and development expense was 30.1 million, which includes 18.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.0 million, which includes 0.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, in the same period of 2023. Personnel and other associated costs increased 2.4 million as we hired additional employees in support of our research and development activities. Costs in support of our NDA submission increased 2.7 million and we invested 1.3 million in supply chain activities in preparation for commercial launch. The cadence of our research and development expenditures will fluctuate depending upon the state of our clinical programs, the timing of manufacturing and other projects necessary to support the submission of an NDA and prepare for commercial launch. The 17.6 million of additional non-cash stock-based compensation being recognized in the period is predominantly due to performance-based RSU grants which partially vested upon the acceptance by the FDA of the NDA submission and fully vest upon the approval by the FDA. 
 General and administrative expense 
 General and administrative expense was 49.2 million, which includes 38.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.3 million, which includes 1.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, in the same period of 2023. Personnel and associated costs increased 3.0 million as we have hired additional employees in preparation for commercial launch and in support of our increased business activities. Professional services expenses and other program costs associated with preparation for commercial launch, including medical affairs activities, increased by 5.9 million. The 36.8 million of additional non-cash stock-based compensation being recognized in the period is predominantly due to performance-based RSU grants which partially vested upon acceptance by the FDA of the NDA submission and fully vest upon approval by the FDA. 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration 
 We are obligated to make cash payments up to a maximum of 21.2 million to the former Essentialis stockholders upon the achievement of certain future commercial milestones associated with the sales of DCCR in accordance with the terms of our merger agreement with Essentialis. The fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration payable by us achieving two commercial sales milestones of 100 million and 200 million in cumulative revenue in future years was estimated to be 14.5 million as of September 30, 2024, a 0.9 million increase from the estimate as of June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the estimate increased by 1.1 million from the 9.4 million estimate as of June 30, 2023. 
 Other income, net 
 We had other income, net of approximately 3.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expense, net of approximately 479,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an

increase in interest income driven by higher cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and long-term marketable securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Personnel and associated costs increased 4.9 million as we hired additional employees in support of our research and development activities. Costs in support of our NDA submission increased 9.9 million and we invested 3.7 million in supply chain activities in preparation for commercial launch. The cadence of our research and development expenditures will fluctuate depending upon the state of our clinical programs, the timing of manufacturing and other projects necessary to support the submission of an NDA and prepare for commercial launch.

 General and administrative expense 
 General and administrative expense was 68.6 million, which includes 46.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.3 million, which includes 2.4 million of non-cash stock-based compensation, in the same period of 2023.

Professional services expenses and other program costs associated with preparation for commercial launch, including medical affairs activities, increased by 9.4 million.

 We are obligated to make cash payments up to a maximum of 21.2 million to the former Essentialis stockholders upon the achievement of certain future commercial milestones associated with the sales of DCCR in accordance with the terms of our merger agreement with Essentialis. The fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration payable by us achieving two commercial sales milestones of 100 million and 200 million in cumulative revenue in future years was estimated to be 14.5 million as of September 30, 2024, a 2.9 million increase from the estimate as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the estimate increased by 1.6 million from the 8.9 million estimate as of December 31, 2022. 
 21 

Other income, net 
 We had other income, net of approximately 8.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expense, net of approximately 0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by higher cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and long-term marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We used 45.1 million of cash in operating activities and had a net loss of 119.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We had an accumulated deficit of 396.3 million at September 30, 2024 as a result of having incurred losses since our inception. We had 48.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, 208.4 million of marketable securities, 27.9 million of long-term marketable securities and 243.2 million of working capital on September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had lease obligations totaling 3.0 million to be paid through August 2029, consisting of two operating leases for office space in Redwood City, California. 
 We have financed our operations principally through issuances of equity securities. In May 2024, we closed an underwritten public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 46.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The gross proceeds of the public offering were 158.7 million, before deducting the underwriter discount and other offering expenses of 9.7 million. In July 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement SM with Jefferies LLC, as sales agent ("Jefferies"), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Jefferies, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 150,000,000. 
 Previously in October 2023, we announced the closing of the underwritten public offering of 3,450,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering of 20.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The gross proceeds of the public offering were 69.0 million, before deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses. We also announced the closing shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants in a concurrent private offering pursuant to the securities purchase agreement with certain investors, including entities affiliated with existing stockholders, at a price per share of common stock equal to the public offering price of 20.00 and a price per pre-funded warrant of 19.99, for gross proceeds of approximately 60.0 million. In aggregate, we received 129.0 million of gross proceeds from this financing. 
 In December 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement providing for the sale of up to 60.0 million in warrants and the common stock issuable upon the exercise thereof. Through September 30, 2024, we have received 10.0 million from the sale of these warrants and 37.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of certain of these warrants. Warrants with an aggregate exercise price of 12.3 million are still outstanding. 
 We expect to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future and may require additional capital to complete our clinical trials, pursue product development initiatives and penetrate markets for the sale of our products. We believe that we will continue to have access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means, but the access to such capital resources is uncertain and is not assured. In the future, if we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our clinical trials and development of new products and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. These measures could cause significant delays in our efforts to complete clinical trials and commercialize our products, which is critical to the realization of our business plan and our future operations.

 Item 3. Quant itative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 There have not been any material changes to our exposure to market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information regarding market risk, refer to the Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk section of the Form 10-K. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 23 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, even if determined effective and no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives to prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 24 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. L egal Proceedings 
 We may, from time to time, be party to litigation and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, third parties may, from time to time, assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. We currently believe that these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business; however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 An investment in our securities has a high degree of risk. Before you invest you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions and/or operating results.
