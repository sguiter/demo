However, the Company has based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and its operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to it. In the event our financing needs are not able to be met by our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, we would seek to raise additional capital through strategic financial opportunities that could include, but are not limited to, future public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, and/or other means. Any amounts raised may be used for the further development and commercialization of product candidates, and for other working capital purposes. There is no guarantee that any of these strategic or financing opportunities will be executed or realized on favorable terms, if at all, and some could be dilutive to existing shareholders.

 Pursuant to an amendment entered into by the Company on October 4, 2024, the Holders may require the Company to redeem all or any part of the Convertible Notes on a redemption date falling on any of the 26, 29, and 32 -month anniversaries of the original issue date of the Convertible Notes (any such date, a Redemption Date upon not less than 60 calendar days written notice prior to the applicable Redemption Date. The Company may also elect to redeem all or any part of the Convertible Notes on a Redemption Date upon not less than 60 calendar days written notice prior to the applicable Redemption Date. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock, in whole or in part, at the option o f the Holders at any time, based on a conversion price of per share of common stock. 
 
 The Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 470 - 20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC 815 - 15, Derivatives and Hedging . Under ASC 815, contracts that are both indexed to its own stock and classified in stockholders equity in its statement of financial position are not considered to be derivative instruments. Based on the Company s analysis, it is determined that the Convertible Notes contain embedded features that are indexed to the Company s own stock and are classified in stockholders equity in the Company s statement of financial position, but do not meet the requirements for bifurcation and recognition as derivatives, and therefore, do not need to be accounted for separately. Accordingly, the proceeds received from the issuance of the Convertible Notes were recorded as a single liability in accordance with ASC 470 on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The Company incurred of debt issuance costs associated with the Convertible Notes, which were recorded as a reduction of the Convertible Notes on the consolidated balance sheets. The debt issuance costs are being amortized and recognized as additional interest expense over the expected life of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. We determined the expected life of the debt is eq ual to the three -year term of the Convertible Notes. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , of interest was paid and debt issuance costs of were amortized and recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , of interest was paid and debt issuance costs of 43,961 were amortized and recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 , accrued interest on the Convertible Notes to related parties and other third parties were and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , accumulated amortized debt issuance costs are . 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , of the Convertible Notes were converted into shares of the Company s common stock. As of September 30, 2024 , convertible notes payable consisted of the following:

 As of September 30, 2024 , the Comp any had stock options outstanding and unvested restricted stock units in addition to shares of common stock available for grant under the 2021 Plan. As of December 31, 2023 , there were stock options outstanding and unvested restricted stock units in addition to shares of co mmon stock available for grant under the 2021 Plan. 
 
 Stock Options 
 
 Options are granted to purchase common stock at prices that are equal to the fair value of the common stock on the date the option is granted. Vesting is determined by the Board of Directors at the time of grant. The term of any stock option awards under the Company s 2011 Plan and 2021 Plan is ten years, except for certain options granted to the contractors which are either two or five years. 
 
 The grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs, including the following. 
 
 Risk-free interest rate . The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury rates with securities approximating the expected lives of options at the date of grant. 
 
 Expected dividend yield . The expected dividend yield is zero, as the Company has never paid dividends to common shareholders and does not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. 
 
 Expected stock price volatility. The expected stock price volatility was calculated based on the Company s own volatility since the DuPont Transaction in 2015. The Company reviews its volatility assumption on an annual basis and has used the Company s historical volatilities since 2016, as the DuPont Transaction resulted in significant changes in the Company s business and capital structure. 

Expected life of option. The expected life of option was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The Company uses the weighted average vesting period and contractual term of the option as the best estimate of the expected life of a new option, except for the options granted to the CEO (i.e., or years) and certain contractors (i.e., or years). 
 
 The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options granted for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows: 
 
 - 
 Expected dividend yield 
 Expected stock price volatility - 
 Expected life of options (in years) -

 Overview 
 
 Description of Business 
 
 Dyadic International, Inc. Dyadic , we , us , our , or the Company is a global biotechnology company based in Jupiter, Florida with operations in the United States and a satellite office in the Netherlands, and it utilizes several third-party consultants and research organizations to carry out the Company s activities. Over the past two plus decades, the Company has developed a gene expression platform for producing commercial quantities of industrial enzymes and other proteins, and has previously licensed this technology to third parties, such as Abengoa Bioenergy, BASF, Codexis and others, for use in industrial (non-pharmaceutical) applications. This technology is based on the Thermothelomyces heterothallica (formerly known as Myceliophthora thermophila fungus, which the Company named C1. 
 
 On December 31, 2015, the Company sold its industrial technology business to Danisco USA Danisco ), the industrial biosciences business of DuPont (NYSE: DD) (the DuPont Transaction ). As part of the DuPont Transaction, Dyadic retained co-exclusive rights to the C1-cell protein production platform for use in all human and animal pharmaceutical applications, and currently the Company has the exclusive ability to enter into sub-license agreements (subject to the terms of the license and to certain exceptions) for use in all human and animal pharmaceutical applications. Danisco retained certain rights to utilize the C1-cell protein production platform in pharmaceutical applications, including the development and production of pharmaceutical products, for which it will be required to make royalty payments to Dyadic upon commercialization. After December 31, 2029, Danisco will have certain rights to sublicense C1 technology to third parties for which the Company will be entitled to receive royalties on such pharmaceutical products for a certain period of time. In certain circumstances, Dyadic may owe a royalty to either Danisco or certain licensors of Danisco, depending upon whether Dyadic elects to utilize certain patents either owned by Danisco or licensed in by Danisco. 
 
 After the DuPont Transaction, the Company has been building innovative microbial platforms to address the growing demand for global protein bioproduction and unmet clinical needs for effective, affordable, and accessible biopharmaceutical products for human and animal health and for other biologic products for use in non-pharmaceutical applications. 
 
 The C1-cell protein production platform is a robust and versatile thermophilic filamentous fungal expression system for the development and production of biologic products including enzymes and other proteins for human and animal health. Some examples of human and animal vaccines and drugs which have the potential to be produced from C1-cells are protein antigens, ferritin nanoparticles, virus-like particles VLPs ), monoclonal antibodies mAbs ), Bi/Tri-specific antibodies, Fab antibody fragments, Fc-fusion proteins, as well as other therapeutic enzymes and proteins. The Company is involved in multiple funded research collaborations with animal and human pharmaceutical companies which are designed to leverage its C1-cell protein production platform to develop innovative vaccines and drugs, biosimilars and/or biobetters. 
 
 The Company also developed the Dapibus thermophilic filamentous fungal based microbial protein production platform to enable the rapid development and large-scale manufacture of low-cost proteins, metabolites, and other biologic products for use in non-pharmaceutical applications, such as food, nutrition, and wellness. 
 
 Recent Developments 

Alternative Proteins 
 
 Non-Food Applications 

On June 28, 2024, the Company announced that it entered into a development and commercialization partnership with Proliant Health and Biologicals PHB ), a leading supplier of purified proteins for the diagnostic, nutrition and cell culture markets. Dyadic has received an initial payment of 500,000 in July 2024 and received a second payment of 500,000 for completing the transfer of a Production Strain according to the terms of the agreement in September 2024, and we expect to receive a final payment of 500,000 upon the meeting of a certain productivity threshold. Dyadic will also receive a share of profits received by PHB from the sale of animal-free recombinant albumin products produced using Dyadic s filamentous fungal microbial platforms. A portion of the final payment will be allocated to the technology transfer and commercialization effort. The initial focus of the partnership will be the commercialization of recombinant human serum albumin products, with the anticipated launch of the first product in the first half of 2025. 

The Company has completed its development of the DNASE-1 enzyme, and a Certificate of Analysis has been issued for the product, sampling efforts have begun. The Company is currently in dialog with manufacturing organizations to produce a research grade DNASE-1 product with anticipation of taking pre-orders by the first quarter of 2025. 

The Company has initiated a project to produce research grade DNA/RNA Polymerases, DNA Ligase, and RNase Inhibitor products; stable cell lines have been developed with optimization and analysis ongoing. These enzymes are essential tools in molecular biology with unique functions in DNA and RNA manipulation. 

The Company has made progress in the production of recombinant transferrin for use in cell culture media for the alternative protein industry and a Certificate of Analysis has been issued for the product product sampling occurred in the third quarter, earlier than originally estimated. Current application testing for recombinant bovine transferrin is ongoing for use in cell culture media for the cultured meat industry, with results expected in the fourth quarter. 

The Company has made progress with its research grade recombinant bovine alpha-lactalbumin; a Certificate of Analysis has been issued for the product; sampling is expected to begin in the late fourth quarter. 

17

Food Applications 

During the third quarter, the Company has received its first milestone of 425,000 for achieving the target yield level from the development and license agreement entered into in 2023 to commercialize certain non-animal dairy enzymes used in the production of food products using the Dapibus protein production platform. This is in addition to the upfront payment of 0.6 million received in October 2023. The development of a second enzyme is progressing. 

The Company has developed a highly productive strain and is actively sampling recombinant alpha-lactalbumin, a whey protein, and has entered into a joint development agreement with a Top 10 global dairy company for the development of food grade alpha-lactalbumin. Additionally, the Company provided samples to four alternative protein companies. 

The Company is sampling recombinant lactoferrin to several interested parties. 

Bio Industrial Products 

Development of five enzymes is ongoing with potential for use in multiple industries, such as nutrition, biogas, biofuels and biorefining. Sampling has been initiated with interested parties. 

Animal Health 

The Company further expanded its collaboration with Phibro/Abic targeting a number of additional vaccines for use in developing livestock animal diseases. 

The Co mpany s C1-produced H5 A/2.3.3.4.b A/Astrakhan ferritin nanoparticle antigen is being evaluated in poultry and cattle trials by multiple partners, underscoring the platform s scalability for animal health application s. 

Human Health 

In collaboration with ViroVax, LLC, the Company co-developed a C1-produced ferritin nanoparticle Mpox antigen that can be manufactured rapidly, cost-effectively, and at flexible scales. Preclinical studies for Mpox vaccine candidate developed in collaboration with ViroVax LLC are scheduled to begin in Q4 2024. 

The Company is advancing its human health collaborations with partnerships with two top ten pharmaceutical companies and a leading biotech, having successfully expressed an antibody targeting digestive health and antigens for HIV, HPV, RSV, and other respiratory viruses. 

Third party collaborator(s) reported data demonstrating all three infectious disease mAbs expressed from C1-cells showed virtual identical neutralizing and binding activity to traditionally produced CHO mAbs. 

The Company submitted multiple applications for grant funding from leading Non-Governmental Organization in collaboration with Fondazione Biotecnopolo di Siena and other partners for a variety of vaccine antigens. 

C1- produced H5 Clade 2.3.3.4.b A/Astrakhan recombinant ferritin nanoparticle sample provided to a prospective partner for development of potential H5 avian influenza Bird Flu diagnostic kit. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 We define critical accounting estimates as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and which may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. In applying these critical accounting estimates, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our critical accounting estimates include the following: 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company has no products approved for sale. All our revenue to date has been research revenue from third-party collaborations and government grants, as well as revenue from sublicensing agreements and collaborative arrangements, which may include upfront payments, options to obtain a license, payment for research and development services, milestone payments and royalties, in the form of cash or non-cash considerations (e.g., minority equity interest). 
 
 Revenue related to research collaborations and agreements: The Company typically performs research and development services as specified in each respective agreement on a best-efforts basis, and recognizes revenue from research funding under collaboration agreements in accordance with the 5-step process outlined in ASC Topic 606 Topic 606 ): (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the service to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive. Depending on how the performance obligation under our license and collaboration agreements is satisfied, we recognize the revenue either at a point in time or over time by using the input method under Topic 606 to measure the progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation. 
 
 Under the input method, revenue will be recognized based on the entity s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation (e.g., resources consumed, labor hours expended, costs incurred, or time elapsed) relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation. The Company believes that the cost-based input method is the best measure of progress to reflect how the Company transfers its performance obligation to a customer. In applying the cost-based input method of revenue recognition, the Company uses actual costs incurred relative to budgeted costs to fulfill the performance obligation. These costs consist primarily of full-time equivalent effort and third-party contract costs. Revenue will be recognized based on actual costs incurred as a percentage of total budgeted costs as the Company completes its performance obligations. 

18

A cost-based input method of revenue recognition requires management to make estimates of costs to complete the Company s performance obligations. In making such estimates, significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to cost estimates. The cumulative effect of revisions to estimated costs to complete the Company s performance obligations will be recorded in the period in which changes are identified and amounts can be reasonably estimated. A significant change in these assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in future periods. 
 
 Revenue related to grants: The Company may receive grants from governments, agencies, and other private and not-for-profit organizations. These grants are intended to be used to fund the Company s research collaborations partially or fully, including opportunities arising in connection with COVID-19 that the Company is pursuing with certain collaborators. However, most, if not all, of such potential grant revenues, if received, is expected to be earmarked for third parties to advance the research required, including preclinical and clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and/or antibodies candidates. 
 
 Revenue related to sublicensing agreements: If the sublicense to the Company s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue allocated to the license when technology is transferred to the customer and the customer can use and benefit from the license. 
 
 Customer options: If the sublicensing agreement includes customer options to purchase additional goods or services, the Company will evaluate if such options are considered material rights to be deemed as separate performance obligations at the inception of each arrangement. 
 
 Milestone payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes development, commercialization, and regulatory milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether the achievement of the milestones is considered probable and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price. If the milestone payment is in exchange for a sublicense and is based on the sublicensee s subsequent sale of product, the Company recognizes milestone payment by applying the accounting guidance for royalties. 
 
 Royalties: With respect to licenses deemed to be the predominant item to which the sales-based royalties relate, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of its sublicensing arrangements. 
 
 We invoice customers based on our contractual arrangements with each customer, which may not be consistent with the period that revenues are recognized. When there is a timing difference between when we invoice customers and when revenues are recognized, we record either a contract asset (unbilled accounts receivable) or a contract liability (deferred research and development obligations), as appropriate. If upfront fees or considerations related to sublicensing agreement are received prior to the technology transfer, the Company will record the amount received as deferred revenue from licensing agreement. 
 
 We are not required to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. 
 
 The Company adopted a practical expedient to expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. 
 
 Accrued Research and Development Expenses 
 
 In order to properly record services that have been rendered but not yet billed to the Company, we review open contracts and purchase orders, communicate with our personnel and we estimate the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly or quarterly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and adjust if necessary. Examples of accrued research and development expenses include amounts owed to contract research organizations, to service providers in connection with research and development activities. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 We have granted stock options to employees, directors, and consultants. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model considers volatility in the price of our stock, the risk-free interest rate, the estimated life of the option, the closing market price of our stock and the exercise price. For purposes of the calculation, we assumed that no dividends would be paid during the life of the options. We also used the weighted-average vesting period and contractual term of the option as the best estimate of the expected life of a new option, except for the options granted to the CEO (i.e., 5 or 10 years) and certain contractors (i.e., 2 or 5 years). The expected stock price volatility was calculated based on the Company s own volatility since the DuPont Transaction. The Company reviews its volatility assumption on an annual basis and has used the Company s historical volatilities since 2016, as the DuPont Transaction resulted in significant changes in the Company s business and capital structure. 
 
 The estimates utilized in the Black-Scholes calculation involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. These estimates are neither predictive nor indicative of the future performance of our stock. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded share-based compensation expense could have been materially different from that reported. In addition, because some of the performance-based options issued to employees, consultants, and other third-parties vest upon the achievement of certain milestones, the total ultimate expense of share-based compensation is uncertain. 

19

Accounting for Income Taxes 
 
 The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . Under this method, income tax expense /(benefit) is recognized for: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 
 In determining taxable income for the Company s consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires the Company to make certain estimates of our actual current tax exposure and assessment of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating the Company s ability to recover its deferred tax assets, the Company must consider all available positive and negative evidence including its past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and its forecast of future taxable income. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. 
 
 The Company is required to evaluate the provisions of ASC 740 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, present, and disclose uncertain positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the net benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits. A liability should be recognized (or amount of net operating loss carry forward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for unrecognized tax benefits, because it represents a company s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized because of applying the provision of ASC 740. 
 
 The Company classifies accrued interest and penalties related to its tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The Company currently is not subject to U.S. federal, state, and local tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2021. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company expects to incur losses and have negative net cash flows from operating activities as it continues developing its microbial platforms and related products, and as it expands its pipelines and engages in further research and development activities for internal products as well as for its third-party collaborators and licensees. The success of the Company depends on its ability to develop its technologies and products to the point of regulatory approval and subsequent revenue generation or through the sublicensing of the Company s technologies and products, and its ability to raise capital to finance these developmental efforts. 
 
 On March 8, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of 6.0 million of its 8.0 Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes due March 8, 2027 (the Convertible Notes in a private placement. The purchasers of the Convertible Notes included immediate family members and family trusts related to Mark Emalfarb, our President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, including The Francisco Trust, an existing holder of more than 5 of the Company s outstanding common stock, (collectively, the Purchasers ). The net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes, after deducting offering expenses, were 5,824,000. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Convertible Notes for working capital and general corporate purposes. This private placement funding is expected to support our near-term revenue growth and accelerate our strategic objective of commercialization opportunities for pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical applications. 
 
 The Convertible Notes are senior, secured obligations of Dyadic and its affiliates, and interest is payable quarterly in cash on the principal amount equal to 8 per annum. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 8, 2027 (the Maturity Date ), unless earlier converted, repurchased, or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes. 

21

The Convertible Notes can be converted into shares of Dyadic s Class A common stock (the Common Stock ), at the option of the holders of the Convertible Notes (the Noteholders at any time prior to the Maturity Date. On October 4, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment (the Amendment to the Convertible Notes. Pursuant to the Amendment, (i) the conversion price upon which the Convertible Notes will be convertible into shares of the Company s common stock is 1.40 per share of common stock, and (ii) the Redemption Date (as defined in the Amendment) will fall on any of the 26, 29 and 32-month anniversaries of the original issue date of the Convertible Notes. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 600,000 of the Convertible Notes were converted in to 335,195 shares of Common Stock. F or more information regarding the Convertible Notes, including the covenants related thereto see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The Company expects its existing cash and cash equivalents and cash raised from the Convertible Notes, investments in debt securities, and operating cash flows from its existing and future license agreement(s) will be sufficient to meet its operational, business, and other liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve (12) months from the date of issuance of the financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report. However, the Company has based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and its operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to it. In the event our financing needs are not able to be met by our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, we would seek to raise additional capital through strategic financial opportunities that could include, but are not limited to, future public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, and/or other means. Any amounts raised may be used for the further development and commercialization of product candidates, and for other working capital purposes. There is no guarantee that any of these strategic or financing opportunities will be executed or realized on favorable terms, if at all, and some could be dilutive to existing shareholders. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , cash and cash equivalents were 5.9 million compared to 6.5 million as of December 31, 2023 . The carrying value of investment grade securities, including accrued interest as of September 30, 2024 , was 4.0 million compared to 0.8 million as of December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.3 million, which was principally attributable to a net loss of 4.3 million , partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 0.2 million and share-based compensation expenses of 0.9 million. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of approximately 5.8 million was principally attributable to a net loss of approximately 4.7 million, gain from the sale of investment in Alphazyme, LLC of approximately 1.0 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 1.0 million, partially offset by share-based compensation expenses of approximately 0.9 million. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.1 millio n, compared to a net cash provided by investing activities of 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to additional purchases of investment securities of 3.7 million, decreases in proceeds received from maturities of investment securities of 5.6 million, and proceeds from the sale of investment in Alphazyme of 1.3 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.8 million , which was related to net proceeds from issuance of convertible notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , there were no cash flows from financing activities. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
