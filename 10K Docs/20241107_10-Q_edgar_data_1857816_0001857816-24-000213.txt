 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements about our current expectations and views of future events. These forward-looking statements relate to events that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these statements.

We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. The forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report relate to, among other things: 
 our goals;

Table of Contents 

These forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that our expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, our actual results could be materially different from our expectations. Important risks and factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our expectations are generally set forth in Summary of Risk Factors, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 1. Business, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 27, 2024, or the 2023 Form 10-K, and other sections in this quarterly report. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should read thoroughly this quarterly report and the documents that we refer to with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from and worse than what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 
 This quarterly report may contain information derived from various government and private publications. These publications include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we believe the data and information to be reliable, we have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data and information contained in these publications. Statistical data in these publications also include projections based on a number of assumptions. Our industry may not grow at the rate projected by market data, or at all. Failure of the market to grow at the projected rate may have a material and adverse effect on our business and the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, projections or estimates about our business and financial prospects involve significant risks and uncertainties. Furthermore, if any one or more of the assumptions underlying the market data are later found to be incorrect, actual results may differ from the projections based on these assumptions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Class A Ordinary Shares This annual report may contain certain industry data and information that were obtained from third-party sources and were not independently verified by us in the 2023 Form 10-K. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The forward-looking statements in this quarterly report are made based on events and information as of the date of this quarterly report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this quarterly report and the documents that we refer to in this quarterly report and have filed as exhibits to this quarterly report, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results or performance may materially differ from what we expect.

 Overview 
 We are a pioneer of global end-to-end B2B ecommerce solutions for large parcel merchandise. We generate revenues primarily through three revenue streams: 
 GigaCloud 3P : generates service revenues, including revenues from platform commission, ocean transportation service, warehousing service, last-mile delivery service, packaging service, drayage service and others, by facilitating transactions between sellers and buyers in our GigaCloud Marketplace. 
 GigaCloud 1P : generates product revenues through the sale of our inventory in our GigaCloud Marketplace. 
 Off-platform ecommerce : generates product revenues through the sale of our inventory to and through third-party ecommerce websites. 
 GMV from GigaCloud 3P and GigaCloud 1P together make up our GigaCloud Marketplace GMV, and GMV from off-platform ecommerce and GigaCloud Marketplace GMV together make up our total GMV across the platforms. These three revenue streams complement each other to improve our value proposition to sellers and buyers in our GigaCloud Marketplace. 
 
 Key Financial and Operating Metrics 
 We monitor the following key financial and operating metrics to evaluate the growth of our GigaCloud Marketplace, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. The financial impact from the acquisitions of Noble House and Wondersign was reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial results since the completion of the acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, we introduced Noble House-related SKUs to our GigaCloud Marketplace, which contributed to a one-time uplift in our operating metrics. The operating impact from these acquisitions has been reflected in the operating metrics in our GigaCloud Marketplace since April 1, 2024.

 GigaCloud Marketplace GMV 
 The growth in GigaCloud Marketplace GMV, including GMV from both GigaCloud 3P and GigaCloud 1P, reflects our ability to attract and retain sellers and buyers in the GigaCloud Marketplace. The revenues we generate in our marketplace are highly correlated to the amount of GMV transacted in the GigaCloud Marketplace. 
 GigaCloud Marketplace GMV increased from 684.7 million in the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,233.6 million in the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, representing a growth of 80.2 period-over-period, primarily due to the continued increase in the numbers of sellers and buyers transacting in our marketplace as our marketplace continues to gain scale and market position. In the second quarter of 2024, we introduced Noble House-related SKUs to our GigaCloud Marketplace, which have been reflected in our GigaCloud Marketplace GMV starting April 1, 2024. 
 28 

Active 3P Sellers 
 The number of active 3P sellers in the GigaCloud Marketplace increased from 741 in the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,051 in the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 41.8 period-over-period. We view active 3P sellers as a key driver of the product catalog in our marketplace, which helps attract and retain buyers. The GigaCloud Marketplace offers SKUs across furniture, home appliances, fitness equipment and other large parcel categories from our active 3P sellers. The number of SKUs from active 3P sellers increased from 22,101 as of December 31, 2023 to 33,086 as of September 30, 2024. We expect to grow the number of active 3P sellers through geographic expansion, suppliers outreach, marketing initiatives, referrals and word-of-mouth. We also leverage our 1P inventory sales to establish new markets, reducing the risk in geographic expansion for new sellers, and increasing the appeal for new sellers to join our marketplace. 
 3P Seller GigaCloud Marketplace GMV 
 3P Seller GigaCloud Marketplace GMV represents the GMV our 3P Sellers transact in the GigaCloud Marketplace. 3P Seller GigaCloud Marketplace GMV was 369.5 million in the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 and 635.5 million in 12 months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 72.0 period-over-period. 3P Seller GigaCloud Marketplace GMV represented 54.0 and 51.5 of total GigaCloud Marketplace GMV in the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Active Buyers 
 The number of active buyers in the GigaCloud Marketplace increased from 4,602 in the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 to 8,535 in the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 85.5 period-over-period. We view the number of active buyers as a key driver of GMV and revenue for our GigaCloud Marketplace. We plan to expand our active buyers by enhancing our marketplace product categories, and leveraging referrals from existing users. 
 Spend Per Active Buyer 
 The spend per active buyer in our GigaCloud Marketplace was 148,793 in the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 144,534 in the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, representing a slight decrease of 2.9 period-over-period. Spend per active buyer is a key driver of GMV and revenue for our GigaCloud Marketplace. We grow spend per active buyer by expanding our product categories, increasing buyers purchase frequency and raising the average price per purchase. The slight decrease in spend per active buyer for the 12 months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a higher number of new buyers onboarded during the period, who generally require time to increase their spending in our GigaCloud Marketplace. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 Key factors affecting our results of operations include the following: 
 Our Ability to Attract and Retain Sellers 
 Sellers in our marketplace are typically manufacturers operating in Asia who utilize our supply chain capabilities to establish overseas sales channels without having to invest in their own logistics or fulfillment centers overseas. We are focused on growing and retaining the number of sellers who choose to list their large parcel merchandise in our marketplace and utilize our fulfillment and logistics network for the shipping and handling of their products. 
 Our number of active 3P sellers was 1,051 in the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 741 in the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 41.8 from 12 months ended September 30, 2023. We believe this increasing trend will continue because of the growing recognition of our marketplace, our seller-friendly comprehensive fulfillment and logistics network which enables hassle-free delivery of large parcel merchandise and our expansion into new markets. 
 Using our marketplace, sellers are able to quickly gain access to key global markets in which we operate, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Japan and Canada. We provide a flat rate program for shipping and handling, and sellers are able to utilize the storage space in our fulfillment centers. We also create sales analytics which provide valuable information as sellers determine which products to bring to market. 
 29 

We attract new sellers predominantly through organic channels such as geographic expansion, suppliers outreach, marketing initiatives, referrals and word-of-mouth. In 2023, we completed the acquisitions of Noble House and Wondersign, which supplemented our supply chain, fulfillment and logistics capabilities and we expect to attract more sellers and buyers into our GigaCloud Marketplace after these strategic acquisitions. We also plan to augment organic customer acquisition by adding additional sales and marketing employees to enhance seller and buyer growth. 
 Our Ability to Attract and Retain Buyers 
 Buyers in our marketplace are typically resellers operating in the U.S., Asia and Europe who procure large parcel merchandise to resell to end customers. Our marketplace is attractive to buyers because we minimize inventory risk from our buyers business operations. Our buyers can browse a product in our marketplace and list the product on their preferred ecommerce websites such as Rakuten, Amazon, Walmart, Wayfair, Home Depot and OTTO, or their own store prior to procuring and storing the product in a warehouse or shop. Once a sale to the end customer takes place, buyers can order the product in our marketplace and we will handle the fulfillment directly to the end customer. 
 In the 12 months ended September 30, 2024, we had 8,535 active buyers in our marketplace with an average 144,534 spend per active buyer, representing a 85.5 increase in active buyers and a 2.9 decrease in spend per active buyer compared to the 4,602 active buyers in our marketplace with an average 148,793 spend per active buyer in the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to increased scale and recognition of our marketplace and an increase in the number of global sales channels for buyers to resell products to end customers. 
 Recent Acquisitions 
 In addition to organic growth, we have grown through acquisitions that have deepened and expanded our presence in current markets and facilitated entry into attractive new markets. 
 In 2023, we completed the acquisition of Noble House, a leading B2B distributor of indoor and outdoor home furnishing, for an aggregate consideration of approximately 77.6 million, and the acquisition of Wondersign, a cloud-based interactive digital signage and e-catalog management SaaS company, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 10.0 million. 
 Following the acquisitions, our results of operations are affected by the newly acquired businesses or operations, the purchase accounting for the acquisition and expenditures made to integrate the newly acquired businesses or operations. As a result of our acquisitions and the consolidation of our operating subsidiaries financial results into our consolidated financial results, the periods presented in our historical financial statements may not be comparable to one another and our future results of operations and financial results may also differ. 
 Overall Economic Trends 
 The overall economic environment and related changes in customer behavior have a significant impact on our business. Customer spending on our products and services is primarily discretionary, and therefore positive economic conditions generally drive stronger business performance. 
 Recent global economic uncertainties, inflation, higher interest rates, surge in fuel and transportation costs, lower consumer confidence and demand for discretionary goods, and geopolitical events such as recent international trade disputes and the ongoing wars in Ukraine and in Israel and Gaza, including the related disruptions to international shipping in the Red Sea could impact the demand of products and shipping and freight rates. We expect an increase in our transportation costs in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to seasonal demand surge which may negatively affect our profitability. Other macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns include employment rates, availability of customer credit, tariffs, interest rates, tax rates and energy costs. 
 Our Ability to Broaden Service Offerings 
 Our results of operations are also affected by our ability to introduce new service offerings. We have a history of expanding our service offering to enhance our customer experience and to increase revenues. We started our business by primarily selling our own self-procured large parcel merchandise directly to end customers. We expanded our service offerings and launched our GigaCloud Marketplace in 2019, and the revenues generated by GigaCloud Marketplace grew quickly, representing 74.4 and 63.7 of our total revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. We continue to evaluate opportunities to launch additional services. 
 30 

Our Ability to Effectively Invest in our Infrastructure and Technology Platform 
 Our results of operations depend in part on our ability to invest in our infrastructure and technology platform to cost-effectively meet the demands of our anticipated growth. Our global fulfillment and logistics network is a key part of our infrastructure, which consists of fulfillment centers and other facilities that are strategically located, designed and equipped to efficiently manage inventory and to fulfill customers orders and other needs. As of September 30, 2024, we leased 37 fulfillment centers with an aggregate gross floor area of approximately 10.5 million square feet in five countries, and two other facilities with storage and showroom functions with an aggregate gross floor area of approximately 18,348 square feet in the U.S. Additionally, we maintain partnerships with several major shipping, trucking and freight service providers to supplement our transportation network and shipping requirements. 
 Our ability to improve our operational efficiency depends on our ability to invest in our infrastructure and technology platform, including our warehousing and fulfillment solutions and AI technology. We also invest in our research and development personnel for the design, development, and testing of our platform, and incur software development costs for the internal-use software and our group s websites. We have successfully improved our infrastructure and technology solutions over the past years. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is subject to seasonality. We expect the last quarter of the year to be the most active because of the November and December holiday sales period. Our GigaCloud Marketplace GMV is usually the largest in the fourth quarter of a year. It is uncertain whether this is an indicator of industry trends going forward. 
 
 Key Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We generate service revenues from our GigaCloud 3P business, and product revenues from our GigaCloud 1P, off-platform ecommerce businesses and others. Service revenues from GigaCloud 3P, including revenues from platform commission, ocean transportation service, warehousing service, last-mile delivery service, packaging service, drayage service and others are generated by facilitating transactions between sellers and buyers in our GigaCloud Marketplace. Product revenues from GigaCloud 1P are generated through the product sales of our inventory through our GigaCloud Marketplace, and product revenues from off-platform ecommerce are generated from product sales of our inventory to and through third-party ecommerce websites.

 Service Revenues GigaCloud 3P 
 We derive service revenues primarily through the various 3P activities of sellers and buyers in the GigaCloud Marketplace, including revenues from platform commission, ocean transportation service, warehousing service, last-mile delivery service, packaging service, drayage service and others. When a seller and buyer enter into a transaction in GigaCloud Marketplace, we generate revenues from platform services by earning a percentage commission depending on the transaction value. The standard commission ranges between 1 and 5 . Additionally, we charge a fulfillment fee for other freight services such as delivery of products via ocean transportation. We charge the sellers storage fees based on the number of days and the size of the products that are stored in our fulfillment centers, and we charge buyers a flat fee for last-mile delivery services for delivery of products to end customers directly from our fulfillment centers, which varies by the weight of the products. We charge drayage service fees in connection with transportation of products from ports to warehouses at a flat fee. We also charge packaging fees in connection with merchandise that we pack and ship. 
 33 

From time to time in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when we had excess fulfillment capacity, we utilized such excess fulfillment capacity and our extensive logistics network to offer third-party logistics services to customers to help fulfill their large parcel transportation needs. As we continue to grow our GigaCloud Marketplace, we expect to dedicate our logistics capacity to customers using our marketplace and to products sold on our own marketplace, and will opportunistically provide third-party logistics services when there is excess capacity within our network. 
 Product Revenues GigaCloud 1P 
 We derive product revenues from the sales of products through selling our own inventory in our marketplace. Our 1P business creates more products for buyers, gives us insights into seller needs, provides us with proprietary data and increases the velocity of sales in our marketplace. 
 Product Revenues Off-platform Ecommerce 
 We derive product revenues primarily from the sales of our own inventory through two sales models, which are (i) product sales made to third-party ecommerce websites, or Product Sales to B, such as Wayfair, Walmart, Home Depot, Amazon, Target and Overstock; and (ii) product sales to individual customers through third-party ecommerce websites, or Product Sales to C, such as Rakuten, Amazon and OTTO, where end customers can visit our online stores and purchase directly from us. Regarding Product Sales to B, as expenses charged by these websites are not in exchange for a distinct good or service, the payments to these websites are not recognized as expenses but as recorded net of revenues. With respect to Product Sales to C, expenses incurred for product sales made through these websites are recorded as selling and marketing expenses. 
 Cost of Revenues

 an increase in rental cost by 190.0 from 14.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 40.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as we increased the number of fulfillment centers to 37 globally in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to meet increased demand during the period; and 
 an increase in staff cost by 107.5 from 8.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 16.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we increased the number of employees. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit increased by 85.4 from 118.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 220.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our gross margin was 25.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 25.5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This change was primarily due to a lower service gross margin from increased costs relating to our expanded fulfillment centers network. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 Our selling and marketing expenses increased by 92.0 from 27.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 52.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to (i) an increase in platform service fee we incurred on certain third-party ecommerce websites by 97.3 from 11.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 22.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as sales volume and sales channels both increased, (ii) an increase in staff cost related to selling and marketing personnel by 73.3 from 13.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher share-based compensation expenses linked to higher share prices for awards granted and vested in 2024, and (iii) an increase in advertising expense by 182.4 from 1.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we increased our marketing efforts. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our general and administrative expenses increased by 237.3 from 16.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 57.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to (i) an increase in staff cost related to general and administrative personnel by 215.4 from 7.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher share-based compensation expenses linked to higher share prices for awards granted and vested in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increased number of staff, (ii) an increase in rental expense by 604.8 from 2.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily because the expenses for certain newly acquired fulfillment centers that are currently under preparation for use were included in rental expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cost of revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as an increase in the number of corporate offices in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the previous period, (iii) an increase in professional service expense by 102.6 from 3.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as we engaged additional professional services from our financial and legal advisors in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the previous period, and (iv) an increase in property insurance expense by 285.7 from 0.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses increased by 362.5 from 1.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to our dedication in expanding our research and development efforts, including an increase in the number of research and development projects and the number of employees to perform research and development function, as well as share-based compensation expenses incurred for awards granted and vested to research and development personnel in nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the previous period.

Losses on Disposal of Property and Equipment 
 We had losses on disposal of property and equipment of 213 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to nil in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 We had interest expenses of 1.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 0.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the balance of finance lease liabilities. 
 Interest Income 
 We had interest income of 2.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 6.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher average bank deposits, wealth management products and investment and interest rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the previous period. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Losses, Net 
 We had foreign currency exchange losses, net of 2.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to foreign currency exchange losses, net of 0.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange losses from the depreciation of Japanese Yen over U.S. dollars during the first half of 2024, largely offset by the gains from the appreciation of Japanese Yen and Euros over U.S. dollars during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Government Grants 
 We had government grant of 473 thousand and 29 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 Others, net 
 Others losses, net was 7 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and others gains, net was 1.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to foreign currency translation gains from the dissolution of a non-principal subsidiary, as well as net gains from other non-operating income and expenses. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 We had income tax expense of 13.6 million and 15.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 Net Income 
 As a result of the foregoing, our net income was 58.5 million and 94.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 Segment Information for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2024

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 45 

To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS diluted, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is net income excluding interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expenses and non-recurring items. Adjusted EPS diluted is a financial measure defined as our Adjusted EBITDA divided by our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS diluted as measures of operating performance, for planning purposes, to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our Board of Directors and investors concerning our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:

Based on the provisions of our insurance policy, the gross losses have been reduced by the estimated insurance proceeds expected to be received from our insurance carrier. We have determined that partial recovery of the incurred losses is probable and therefore recorded net losses of 308 thousands in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We do not believe such losses to be recurring or frequent in nature.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 To date, we have financed our operating and investing activities mainly through cash generated from our business. As of September 30, 2024, we had 217.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and 0.7 million in restricted cash. 
 In July 2022, we entered into a two-year credit facility agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, under which we are able to borrow up to 50 million during the term of the facility. The credit facility also requires us to comply with various customary covenants and other restrictions. In July 2024, we renewed the credit facility with a maturity date of June 30, 2026. As of the date of this quarterly report, we have not made any draw down from this credit facility. 
 We believe our cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for general corporate purposes for at least the next 12 months. We may, however, need additional cash resources in the future if we experience changes in business conditions or other developments. We may also need additional cash resources in the future if we find and wish to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, capital expenditure or similar actions. If we determine that our cash requirements exceed the amount of cash we have on hand, we may seek to issue equity or equity-linked securities or obtain debt financing. The issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 
 As a Cayman Islands exempted company and offshore holding company, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our PRC Subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions, subject to relevant approval, filing and/or reporting with respect to government authorities and limits on the amount of capital contributions and loans. This may delay us from making loans or capital contributions to our PRC Subsidiaries, if any. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Doing Business in China PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investments in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may restrict or prevent us to make loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC Subsidiaries, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. including in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 3.4 million, primarily consisting of repayment of finance obligations of 1.7 million and payment for share repurchase of 1.6 million. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In June 2023, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program to repurchase up to US 25.0 million of our Class A ordinary shares over the next 12 months, which expired in June 2024. On September 3, 2024, we announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program under which we may purchase up to 46.0 million of our Class A ordinary shares, par value 0.05, over a 12-month period. Under the share repurchase program, we may purchase our ordinary shares through various means, including open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, any combination thereof or other legally permissible means. We may effect repurchase transactions in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, price, trading volume and general market conditions, along with our working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. Our board of directors will review the share repurchase program periodically, and may modify, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. We plan to fund repurchases from our existing cash balance. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we did not make any repurchase of our Class A ordinary shares. Since the establishment of the new share repurchase program, between October 1, 2024 and November 6, 2024, the Company has repurchased an aggregate of 468,559 Class A ordinary shares in the open market at a total consideration of approximately 11.4 million pursuant to a repurchase plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act which we entered into on September 27, 2024. 
 Capital Resources 
 Our capital expenditures consist primarily of purchase of property and equipment. Our capital expenditures were 0.8 million and 14.0 million in September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. We intend to fund our future capital 
 48 

expenditures with our existing cash balance, short-term investments and anticipated cash flows from operations. We will continue to make well-planned capital expenditures to meet the expected growth of our business. 
 Contractual Obligations

 (1) Lease commitment consists of the commitments under the lease agreements for our fulfillment centers and storage shelves. 
 Except for those disclosed above, we did not have any significant capital or other commitments, long-term obligations, or guarantees as of September 30, 2024. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 
 We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any unconsolidated third parties. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholders equity or that are not reflected in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. Moreover, we do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or product development services with us. 
 Holding Company Structure 
 The Cayman Islands currently has no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions which may affect the import or export of capital, including the availability of cash and cash equivalents for use by our company, or the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of our securities. 
 Our company, GigaCloud Technology Inc, is a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with no material operations of its own and is not a direct Chinese or Hong Kong operating company. We conduct our operations primarily through our principal subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. 
 In addition, as determined in accordance with local regulations, our subsidiaries in certain of our markets may be restricted from paying us dividends offshore or from transferring a portion of their assets to us, whether in the form of dividends, loans or advances, unless certain requirements are met or regulatory approvals are obtained. In addition, our subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay dividends or distributions or make other transfers to us as a result of the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization and agreements of our subsidiaries. See Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Dividends of the 2023 Form 10-K. Even though we currently do not require any such dividends, loans or advances from our entities for working capital and other funding purposes, we may in the future require additional cash resources from them due to changes in business conditions, to fund future acquisitions and development, or merely to declare and pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders. 
 Trend Information 
 Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this quarterly report, we are not aware of any known trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that are reasonably likely to cause a material change in the relationship between costs and revenues, or that would cause reported financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial conditions. 
 49 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates. For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, we had not identified critical accounting estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and would have a material impact on our results. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 A list of recently issued accounting pronouncements that are relevant to us is included in Note 1 Recent accounting pronouncements to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no material changes in our exposures to market risk since December 31, 2023. See Part II Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in the 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion on our exposures to market risk. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. 
 Based upon that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses that have been identified relate to (i) our lack of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate knowledge of U.S. GAAP and the SEC reporting requirements to formalize, design, implement and operate key controls over financial reporting process to address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP and financial reporting requirements set forth by the SEC, which could result in misstatements in relevant financial statement accounts and disclosures, and (ii) the design and implementation of our internal control over the independent review of journal entries due to the absence of formalized accounting policies and procedures, as well as inappropriate segregation of duties specific to the preparation and review of journal entries, which could result in misstatements not being timely prevented or detected, with potentially impact on all financial statement accounts and disclosures. 
 We are in the process of implementing a number of measures to address the material weaknesses identified, including: (1) hiring additional accounting and financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience, (2) expanding the capabilities of existing accounting and financial reporting personnel through continuous training and education in the accounting and reporting requirements under U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and regulations, (3) establishing clear roles and responsibilities to develop and implement formal comprehensive financial period-end closing policies and procedures to ensure all transactions are properly recorded and disclosed, (4) establishing effective monitoring and oversight controls for non-recurring and complex transactions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and (5) designing and implementing formal accounting policies with periodic reviews, procedures and controls supporting our period-end financial reporting process, including controls over the preparation and review of account reconciliations and journal entries. The process of designing and implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligation.

 We are taking actions to remediate the material weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting, as described above. We are currently assessing the operating effectiveness of the remediated or new controls. Except as otherwise described herein, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be involved in claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly and time-consuming, as it can divert management s attention from important business matters and initiatives, negatively impacting our overall operations. In addition, we may also find ourselves at greater risk to outside party claims as we increase our operations in jurisdictions where the laws with respect to the potential liability of online retailers are uncertain, unfavorable or unclear. 
 Southern District of New York Litigation Matter, In Re GigaCloud Technology Inc Securities Litigation, No. 1:23-cv-10645-JMF (S.D.N.Y.) 
 In October 2023, two GigaCloud shareholders separately brought putative securities class actions in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On November 27, 2023, the United States District Court for the Central District of California granted the parties stipulations to transfer both cases to United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On January 12, 2024, the Southern District of New York granted plaintiffs stipulation to consolidate the two lawsuits into one and appoint Sashi Rajan and Meir Spear as co-lead plaintiffs. On March 18, 2024, lead plaintiffs filed the first amended complaint against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers, alleging that defendants made false and misleading statements concerning our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in violation of U.S. securities laws. On May 17, 2024, we filed a motion to dismiss lead plaintiffs claims. On May 20, 2024, the Court entered an order giving lead plaintiffs one opportunity to amend their complaint to address issues raised in the May 17, 2024 motion to dismiss. On June 28, 2024, lead plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint. The second amended complaint alleges both false and misleading statements concerning our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning and false and misleading statements about revenue of the GigaCloud Marketplace. We believe that the claims asserted in the second amended complaint are without merit and have moved to dismiss the case. Although the outcome of any complex litigation is inherently uncertain, based on information presently known to management, we do not believe that the matters are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 We are subject to risks and uncertainties that could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, strategies, and/or prospects. We have reviewed the risk factors appeared in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors in the 2023 Form 10-K, and, except as presented below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We depend on our relationships with third parties, including third-party trucking and freight service companies, and changes in our relationships with these parties could adversely impact our revenues and profits. 
 We rely on third parties to operate certain elements of our business. For example, we rely on third-party national, regional and local trucking and freight service companies to deliver our large parcel merchandise. As a result, we may be subject to shipping delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather, natural disasters, system interruptions and technology failures, political instability, military conflicts, labor activism, health epidemics or bioterrorism. For example, following the initial conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East, the Houthi movement in Yemen launched a number of attacks on marine vessels traversing the Red Sea causing significant operational disruptions for certain third-party business partners. The conflict is ongoing, and should it escalate or expand, it could result in delays, increased shipping and freight costs, and potential disruptions to the arrival of our products. We have in the past entered, and may from time to time enter, into fixed-rate contracts with third-party transportation service providers to mitigate the impact against any further increase in ocean freight costs in the short term. If the prevailing market ocean freight rates decline to rates lower than our contracted rates, our costs and profitability may be negatively impacted. We are also subject to risks of breakage or other damage during delivery by any of these third parties. We also use and rely on other services from third parties, such as telecommunications services, customs, consolidation and shipping services, as well as warranty, installation, assembly and design services. We may be unable to maintain these relationships, and these services may also be subject to outages and 
 51 

interruptions that are not within our control. Third parties may in the future determine they no longer wish to do business with us or may decide to take other actions that could harm our business. We may also determine that we no longer want to do business with them. If parcels are not delivered in a timely fashion or are damaged during the delivery process by these third parties, or if we are not able to provide adequate customer support or other services or offerings, our customers could become dissatisfied and cease using our cross-border fulfillment services or stop trading products through our marketplace, which would adversely affect our operating results. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 None. 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers. 
 On June 14, 2023, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which we may purchase up to 25.0 million of our Class A ordinary shares, par value 0.05, over a 12-month period, which expired in June 2024. On September 3, 2024, we announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program under which we may purchase up to 46.0 million of our Class A ordinary shares, par value 0.05, over a 12-month period. Under the share repurchase program, we may purchase our ordinary shares through various means, including open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, any combination thereof or other legally permissible means. 
 We evaluated the trading prices of its ordinary shares, its financial position and other information and considered the share repurchase by us would be in the best interests of our company and our shareholders. 
 We may effect repurchase transactions in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, price, trading volume and general market conditions, along with our working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. Our board of directors will review the share repurchase program periodically, and may modify, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. We plan to fund repurchases from our existing cash balance. 
 During our third quarter of 2024 covered in this quarterly report, we did not repurchase any of our Class A ordinary shares. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information. 
 (a) and (b) None. 
 (c) Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, each as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
