 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate of basis points was primarily attributable to the impact of the discrete treatment of the charge associated with the talcum litigation settlement agreements (See Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion) and charges associated with restructuring and other activities recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The loss before income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased the impact of these discrete items on the effective tax rate. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, including a tax provision implementing a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax based on global adjusted financial statement income. The corporate alternative minimum tax did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 On August 26, 2024, the U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner. The decision related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act deduction for certain deemed foreign dividends otherwise subject to the Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings of applicable foreign subsidiaries. Based on the Company's evaluation of the technical merits of this decision, the Company intends to timely file a protective refund claim with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in fiscal 2025 claiming a Transition Tax payable reduction of approximately million. Although the Company has accrued the million estimated tax benefit in the provision for income taxes and reduced the Transition Tax payable in the fiscal 2025 first quarter by million, at this time the Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that the intended Transition Tax payable reduction claim will not be sustained. As such, in the fiscal 2025 first quarter the Company has correspondingly increased the provision for income taxes for the estimated million tax benefit to establish an uncertain tax position reserve accrual for the estimated million Transition Tax at issue. As a result, there was no net impact from this development in the provision for income taxes and accompanying consolidated statement of earnings (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, the million Transition Tax payable reduction and offsetting million uncertain tax position reserve accrual are included in Other noncurrent liabilities. 
 
 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued "Pillar Two" Global Anti-Base Erosion model rules for countries to enact into domestic law that would establish a 15 global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis for multinational companies. In certain countries that have enacted legislation incorporating the global minimum tax, it became effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2025. The estimated tax impact of such legislation has been included in the provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was not material. We are continuing to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of newly enacted legislation incorporating the global minimum tax in additional countries. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, totaled million and million, respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was million. The significant increase in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 as compared to June 30, 2024 was attributable to having established an uncertain tax position reserve accrual for the Transition Tax payable reduction position determined in the fiscal 2025 first quarter based on the August 26, 2024 U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian Medical Systems v. Commissioner, as discussed above. The total gross interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings (loss) was million. The total gross accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, was million and million, respectively. On the basis of the information available as of September 30, 2024, the Company does not expect significant changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

 restructuring program ("Restructuring Program"). The Restructuring Program s main focus includes the reorganization and rightsizing of certain areas of the Company as well as simplification and acceleration of processes. The Company committed to this course of action on February 1, 2024. 
 
 In connection with the Restructuring Program, as of September 30, 2024, the Company continues to estimate a net reduction in the range of approximately to positions globally, which is about - of its positions including temporary and part-time employees as of June 30, 2023. This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions as well as retraining and redeployment of certain employees in select areas. 
 
 The Company plans to substantially complete specific initiatives under the Restructuring Program through fiscal 2026. The Company expects that the Restructuring Program will result in restructuring and other charges totaling between million and million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, contract terminations, asset write-offs and other costs associated with implementing these initiatives.

 Fair Value Hedges 
 
 The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness. At September 30, 2024, the Company has interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling million and million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2030 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes, respectively, to variable interest rates based on the fallback Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a margin. These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. 
 
 The Company enters into cross-currency swap contracts to manage the exposure of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on its intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. At September 30, 2024, the Company has cross-currency swap contracts with notional amounts totaling million, to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. The cross-currency swap contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the related intercompany debt, and the gains and losses representing hedge components included in the assessment of effectiveness are presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis. The earnings recognition of excluded components is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction. Any difference between the changes in the fair value of the excluded components and amounts recognized in earnings will be recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ("AOCI"). 
 
 The estimated net gain on the Company s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges as of September 30, 2024 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is million. The accumulated net gain (loss) on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in AOCI was million and ) million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts, and may enter into foreign currency option contracts, to hedge anticipated transactions and receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries. The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of June 2026. Hedge effectiveness of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on the forward method, which includes time value in the effectiveness assessment. At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash flow hedges outstanding with a notional amount totaling million. 
 
 For foreign currency hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to Net sales when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs. If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period Net sales. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s foreign currency cash flow hedges were highly effective. 
 
 The Company may enter into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company s identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance.

 million. The accumulated net gain on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in AOCI was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 
 The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations. Time value is excluded from the effectiveness assessment and is recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the Company s net investment in these foreign operations. The net investment hedge contracts have varying maturities through the end of September 2025. Hedge effectiveness of the net investment hedge contracts is based on the spot method. At September 30, 2024, the Company had net investment hedges outstanding with a notional amount totaling million. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 As a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least nationally recognized rating agencies. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled million at September 30, 2024. To manage this risk, the Company has strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored. Accordingly, management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote.

 individual cases (including cases that were settled in subsequent talcum litigation settlement agreements described below) pending against the Company in state and federal courts throughout the United States, as compared to cases as of June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, new cases were filed and cases were resolved by settlement or voluntary dismissal (including pursuant to the cases that were settled in subsequent talcum litigation settlement agreements described below). 
 
 Due to the rising number of cases against the Company, as well as the evolving litigation landscape, there is an expectation that claims may increase in the future. In order to mitigate our future exposure, from the end of August 2024 through October 2024, the Company reached agreements with certain plaintiff law firms (collectively, the talcum litigation settlement agreements for: (i) the resolution of over pending cosmetic talcum powder matters handled by those firms as well as (ii) a process for resolving potential future cosmetic talcum powder claims expected to be brought on behalf of plaintiffs by those firms from January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2029, with annual capped amounts per year for each participating law firm. 
 
 To account for the talcum litigation settlement agreements, the Company recorded a charge of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the amount agreed to settle these current and potential future claims (amounts recorded for potential future claims is based on the best estimate of the probable loss and a reasonably possible loss beyond the amounts recorded is not expected to be material). As of September 30, 2024, million is recorded in Other accrued liabilities and million is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet related to the talcum litigation settlement agreements (inclusive of accruals recorded in prior periods for any cases settled under these agreements). 
 
 There are and could be other plaintiff law firms outside of those included in the talcum litigation settlement agreements that bring claims against the Company. The value of other settlements outside of the talcum litigation settlement agreements, either individually or in the aggregate, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was not material. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of all individual cases pending against the Company or potential unasserted claims, and therefore a specific estimate and associated provision is made for a small number of individual cases that have advanced to the later stages of legal proceedings. For the remaining filed cases, we record an estimate of exposure loss on an aggregated and ongoing basis, which takes into account the historical outcomes of cases we have resolved to date. Any adverse outcomes, either in an individual case or in the aggregate, could be material. While the Company and its legal counsel intend to continue to defend these cases vigorously, there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters. The amounts recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for such litigation, outside of the talcum litigation settlement agreements, are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. The range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities currently cannot be reasonably estimated.

Vesting of RSUs is generally subject to the continued employment or the retirement of the grantees. The RSUs are generally accompanied by dividend equivalent rights, payable upon settlement of the RSUs either in cash or shares (based on the terms of the particular award) and, as such, were generally valued at the closing market price of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. 
 
 Performance Share Units 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted PSUs with a target payout of approximately million shares of Class A Common Stock with a grant date fair value per share of , which will be settled in stock subject to the achievement of the Company s net sales, diluted net earnings per common share and return on invested capital goals for the three fiscal years ending June 30, 2027, all subject to continued employment or the retirement of the grantees. For PSUs granted, no settlement will occur for results below the applicable minimum threshold. PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash upon settlement of the PSUs and, as such, were valued at the closing market value of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. 
 For the PSUs with a performance period ended June 30, 2024, the target goals set at the time of issuance were not achieved, resulting in no shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock issued related to these awards. 
 
 Long-term Performance Share Units

 business segment, beauty products, management also evaluates performance on a product category basis. Product category performance is measured based upon net sales before returns associated with restructuring and other activities, and operating income (loss) before charges associated with restructuring and other activities. Returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the Company's product categories or geographic regions because they are centrally directed and controlled, are not included in internal measures of product category or geographic region performance, and result from activities that are deemed Company-wide initiatives to redesign, resize and reorganize select areas of the business. 
 The accounting policies for the Company s reportable segments are substantially the same as those for the consolidated financial statements, as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the Chief Executive or included herein. There has been no significant variance in the total or long-lived asset values associated with the Company s segment data since June 30, 2024. 
 During the fiscal 2024 second quarter, the Company identified and corrected prior-period misclassifications of net sales and operating income between certain of the Company s product categories in its segment footnote. As a result, product category net sales and operating income have been adjusted from the amounts previously reported for the three months ended September 30, 2023, for comparability purposes. The misclassifications had no impact on the prior-period consolidated statements of earnings, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheets, or the consolidated statements of cash flows, and the Company determined that the impact on the Company s previously issued financial statements for the respective period was not material.

 Not adjusted for differences caused by rounding 
 Period-over-period changes in our net sales are generally attributable to the impacts from (i) pricing on our base portfolio, including changes in mix and those due to strategic pricing actions, (ii) volume, including changes driven by the impact of new product innovation, (iii) acquisitions and/or divestitures, and/or (iv) foreign currency translation. The percentages disclosed for these impacts are calculated on an individual basis. 
 
 The net sales impact from pricing consists of changes in list prices, due to strategic pricing actions, and mix shifts within and among product categories, geographic regions, brands and distribution channels. The prices at which we sell our products vary by brand, distribution channel (e.g., wholesale or direct-to-consumer) and may also vary by country. Our brands and products cover a broad array of pricing tiers. Prices of skin care and fragrance products are typically higher than makeup and hair care products. 
 
 New product innovation includes the introduction of new products, as well as changes related to existing products or where they are sold, including reformulations, regional expansion, repackaging and sets. A product is considered "new innovation" for the twelve-month period following the initial shipment date. Our innovation is launched at different price points than existing products and value derived from innovation may vary from year to year. We continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives. The economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period. The introduction of new products often has some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning. The impact of new product introductions, including timing compared to introductions in prior periods, also affects our results.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period-to-period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 51 for reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. 
 
 We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the United States. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our results of operations. Therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the United States. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current-period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates and adjusting for the period-over-period impact of foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. 

Overview 
 
 We are a leader in prestige beauty, which combines the repeat purchase and relative affordability of consumer goods with high quality products and services. Within prestige beauty, we are diversified by product category, geography, brand, product sub-category, channel, consumer segment and price point. We also leverage consumer analytics and insights by deploying our brands to grow sales and pursue profitable opportunities. These analytics and insights, combined with our creativity, inform our innovation to provide a broad, locally-relevant and inclusive range of prestige products with the aim of competing effectively for a greater share of a consumer's beauty routine. Elements of our strategy are described below, as well as in the Overview on page 31 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Our skin care net sales decreased 7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower net sales from La Mer and Est e Lauder. Net sales from La Mer decreased, primarily driven by lower net sales in our Asia travel retail business, due to lower replenishment orders reflecting (i) the challenging retail environment, including worsened consumer sentiment in China, (ii) travelers diverting spending towards experiences, which continued to dampen conversion for beauty products and (iii) inventory pressure given the further retail market deceleration. The decrease in net sales from Est e Lauder was primarily driven by lower net sales in mainland China, reflecting the impacts from further softening in overall prestige beauty in mainland China, due in large part to worsened consumer sentiment. 
 
 Our makeup net sales decreased 2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting lower net sales from M A C, and to a lesser extent, Too Faced and Smashbox. The decrease in net sales from M A C was primarily driven by lower net sales in North America, reflecting softness in the brand's retail sales, resulting in lower replenishment orders, and lower net sales in the Middle East reflecting ongoing business disruption. Partially offsetting the decrease in makeup net sales was higher net sales from Clinique and, to a lesser extent, Est e Lauder. 
 
 Our fragrance net sales decreased 1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting lower net sales from TOM FORD, Clinique, and Est e Lauder. Net sales from TOM FORD decreased, primarily driven by lower net sales in North America, reflecting softness in the brand's retail sales, resulting in lower replenishment orders. The decrease in net sales from Clinique reflected lower replenishment orders in our global travel retail business and in other parts of Europe, the Middle East Africa primarily due to lower demand. Net sales from Est e Lauder decreased, primarily driven by lower net sales across our product portfolio. Partially offsetting the decrease in fragrance net sales were higher net sales from Le Labo and Kilian Paris. 
 
 Our hair care net sales decreased 6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to lower net sales from Aveda and to a lesser extent, The Ordinary. The decrease in net sales from Aveda was primarily driven by the timing of shipments and continued softness in our North America salon channel and our direct-to-consumer business.

 Our global distribution capability and operations allow us to focus on targeted expanded consumer reach wherever consumer demographics and trends are attractive. Our regional organizations, and the expertise of our people there, enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications. We are continually evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and where they travel, including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories. We tailor implementation of our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace inclusion and cultural diversity. We strive to strengthen our presence in large, image-building core markets, while broadening our presence in emerging markets. 
 
 Net sales in The Americas decreased 2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting lower net sales in North America and Mexico. The decrease in net sales in North America reflected the challenges from M A C, Aveda, TOM FORD, Too Faced and Smashbox. Partially offsetting these pressures in North America was the launch of seven brands to-date in Amazon's U.S. Beauty store. Net sales in Mexico decreased, primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. 
 
 Net sales in Europe, the Middle East Africa decreased 2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower net sales from our Asia travel retail business and the United Kingdom. Asia travel retail net sales declined, due to lower replenishment orders reflecting (i) the challenging retail environment, including worsened consumer sentiment in China, (ii) travelers diverting spending towards experiences, which continued to dampen conversion for beauty products and (iii) inventory pressure given the further retail market deceleration. Partially offsetting the decrease in net sales in Europe, the Middle East Africa were higher net sales in Germany, the Nordic countries and Russia. 
 
 Net sales in Asia/Pacific decreased 11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower net sales from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, reflecting worsened consumer sentiment. This drove further softening in overall prestige beauty in mainland China and low conversion rates among traveling consumers in Hong Kong SAR. 
 
 Outlook 
 
 We have experienced challenges within our business, including in our Asia travel retail business, and we expect volatility and uncertainty to continue including inventory pressure in Asia travel retail given the further retail market deceleration. We have experienced, and are expecting to continue to experience, weakness in overall prestige beauty due in large part to worsened consumer sentiment in China, which is also expected to impact Asia travel retail. Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic about the potential medium- to long-term growth opportunities presented by the new economic stimulus measures in China, but volatility and uncertainty remain elevated in the near-term. In North America, we are experiencing ongoing competitive pressures along with the continued slowdown in prestige beauty growth. We also expect further business disruption in Israel and other parts of the Middle East. Net sales from Israel and the Middle East accounted for approximately 2 and 3 of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2024 and the first quarter of fiscal 2025, respectively. These challenges are collectively expected to impact net sales and profitability, including impacts to our effective tax rate from changes to our geographical mix of earnings. 
 
 We believe that the best way to increase long-term stockholder value is to provide superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing shifts in consumers behaviors and shopping practices. Accordingly, our long-term strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable. We plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth. 
 
 We continue to monitor the effects of the global macro environment, including the risk of recession; currency volatility; inflationary pressures; supply chain challenges; social and political issues; competitive pressures; legal and regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs and sanctions; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues. For example, the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are also mindful of inflationary pressures on our cost base and are monitoring the impact on consumer preferences, and the impact of changes being made in the organization, including those related to the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan. Declines in net sales and profitability may adversely impact the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our brands, as well as long-lived assets, potentially resulting in impairments.

 Restructuring Program Component of the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan 
 
 As previously communicated on November 1, 2023, we launched the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan ("PRGP"), to help progressively rebuild our profit margins in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. 
 
 The PRGP is focused on rebuilding stronger, more sustainable profitability, supporting sales growth acceleration and increasing speed and agility. The plan is designed to improve gross margin, lower the cost base and reduce overhead expenses, while increasing investments in key consumer-facing activities. Upon completion of this plan, we expect to have improved our gross margin and expense base to drive greater operating leverage for the future. 
 
 As a component of the PRGP, on February 5, 2024, we announced a two-year restructuring program. The restructuring program s main focus includes the reorganization and rightsizing of certain areas of our business as well as simplification and acceleration of processes. We committed to this course of action on February 1, 2024. 
 
 In connection with the restructuring program, as of September 30, 2024, we continue to estimate a net reduction in the range of approximately 1,800 to 3,000 positions globally, which is about 3-5 of our positions including temporary and part-time employees as of June 30, 2023. This reduction takes into account the elimination of some positions as well as retraining and redeployment of certain employees in select areas. 
 
 We plan to substantially complete specific initiatives under the restructuring program through fiscal 2026. We expect that the restructuring program will result in restructuring and other charges totaling between 500 million and 700 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, contract terminations, asset write-offs and other costs associated with implementing these initiatives. 
 
 Once fully implemented, we expect the restructuring program to yield annual target gross benefits of between 350 million and 500 million, before taxes, a portion of which is expected to be reinvested in consumer-facing activities. The net benefits of the PRGP, which includes the restructuring program, are expected to be between 1,100 million and 1,400 million. 
 
 Further information about the Restructuring Program Component of the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan, is described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3 Charges Associated with Restructuring and Other Activities herein. 
 
 Talcum Litigation Settlement Agreements 
 
 From the end of August 2024 through October 2024, we reached agreements with certain plaintiff law firms (collectively, the talcum litigation settlement agreements for: (i) the resolution of pending cosmetic talcum powder matters handled by those firms as well as (ii) a process for resolving potential future cosmetic talcum powder claims expected to be brought on behalf of plaintiffs by those firms from January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2029, with annual capped amounts per year for each participating law firm. To account for the talc litigation settlement agreements, we recorded a charge of 159 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 for the amount agreed to settle these current and potential future claims. 
 
 Further information about the talcum litigation settlement agreements, is described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies herein.

 The increase in gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by lower obsolescence charges, due to a reduction in excess inventory. Also contributing to the increase in gross margin was the favorable impact from manufacturing costs and other, reflecting the impact in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the recognition of manufacturing variances associated with reduced manufacturing volumes on our standard cost within cost of sales in the fiscal 2024 third quarter, as well as favorability in cost management, partially offset by the impact of inflation on our costs. 
 
 These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from our mix of business, driven by the impact of lower net sales, including the change in category mix reflecting a decrease in skin care net sales which typically have higher margins than other product categories. These increases in mix of business were partially offset by the benefit of strategic pricing actions.

 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 
 The provision or benefit for income taxes represents U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations. Our effective tax rate will change from quarter-to-quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, the interaction of various global tax strategies and the impact from certain acquisitions. In addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change. 
 Three Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Effective rate for income taxes 13.3 21.7 Basis-point change from the prior-year period (840) 
 
 The decrease in the effective tax rate of 840 basis points was primarily attributable to the impact of the discrete treatment of the charge associated with the talcum litigation settlement agreements and charges associated with restructuring and other activities recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The loss before income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased the impact of these discrete items on the effective tax rate.

 RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 We use certain non-GAAP financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business. Management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or do not reflect the Company s underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period. In the future, we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below; however, the impact to the Company s results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies. While we consider the non-GAAP measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The following tables present Net sales, Operating income and Diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities; talcum litigation settlement agreements; the change in fair value of acquisition-related stock options; and the effects of foreign currency translation.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 Our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the United States and abroad. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2,350 million compared with 3,395 million at June 30, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions. To mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength, and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure. 
 
 Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support seasonal working capital needs, currently planned business operations, information technology enhancements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis. 
 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in the Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional U.S. federal income tax. We continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our applicable foreign earnings. We do not believe continuing to reinvest these applicable foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations. If these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions.

 Inflation impacted our overall operating results in the fiscal 2025 first quarter and we expect it to continue. Generally, we have plans to introduce new products at higher prices, increase prices and implement other operating efficiencies which we expect to offset some of these cost increases. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 Changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs. Our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility. Downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. As of October 24, 2024, our long-term debt is rated A with a negative outlook by Standard Poor s and A2 with a stable outlook by Moody s.

 Cash Flows Three Months Ended September 30 (In millions) 2024 2023 Net cash flows used for operating activities 
 (670) (408) Net cash flows used for investing activities (160) (295) Net cash flows used for financing activities 
 (226) (219) 

The change in net cash flows used for operating activities was primarily driven by the loss before tax for the three months ended September 30, 2024, excluding non-cash items, and an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities variances, reflecting an unfavorable change in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, accounts payable and inventory and promotional merchandise, partially offset by a favorable change in accounts receivable. 
 
 The change in net cash flows used for investing activities was primarily driven by a favorable year-over-year impact from payments made relating to the manufacturing facility in Japan, near Tokyo in the prior-year period. 
 
 Dividends 
 For a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11 Equity and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest . 
 
 Pension and Post-retirement Plan Funding 
 There have been no significant changes to our pension and post-retirement funding as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Commitments, Contractual Obligations and Contingencies 
 There have been no other significant changes to our commitments and contractual obligations as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 . For a discussion of contingencies, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies .

 Credit Risk

 Market Risk 
 We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. To perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately 375 million and 371 million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. This potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures. 
 
 We also enter into cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. A hypothetical 10 weakening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our cross-currency swap contracts would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately 49 million at each of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 
 THE EST E LAUDER COMPANIES INC. 

 In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances. Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately 49 million and 48 million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. These estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex, and consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical accounting policies relate to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets - impairment assessment and income taxes. Since June 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to our critical accounting policies. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 For a discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on the Company s consolidated financial statements, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . 
 
 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 We and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including in this and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders, which may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may address our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, other performance measures, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information technology initiatives, new methods of sale, our long-term strategy, restructuring and other charges and resulting cost savings, and future operations or operating results. These statements may contain words like expect, will, will likely result, would, believe, estimate, planned, plans, intends, may, should, could, anticipate, estimate, project, projected, forecast, and forecasted or similar expressions. Although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation: 
 (1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses; 
 (2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on which future operating results may depend and to successfully address challenges in our business;
