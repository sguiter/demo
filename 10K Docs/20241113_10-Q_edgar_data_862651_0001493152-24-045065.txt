Mining
Revenue 

We
generate revenue from mining bitcoin. The Company has entered into a digital asset mining pool by executing a contract, as amended from
time to time, with the mining pool operator to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contract is terminable at any time by
either party without penalty and the Company s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing
power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, we are entitled to a Full-Pay-Per-Share payout of Bitcoin
based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided by us to the mining pool as a percentage of total network
hash rate, and other inputs. We are entitled to consideration even if a block is not successfully placed by the mining pool operator. 

Providing
computing power to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as solving
a block is an output of the Company s ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only
performance obligation in the Company s contract with the mining pool operator. The transaction consideration the Company receives
is net of a contractually agreed upon pool fee percentage charged and kept by the mining pool operator and is noncash,
in the form of Bitcoin, which the Company measures at fair value on the date Bitcoin is received. This value is not materially different
than the fair value at the moment we meet the performance obligation, which can be recalculated based on the contractual formula. The
consideration is variable. The amount of consideration recognized is constrained to the amount of consideration received, which is when
it is probable a significant reversal will not occur. There is no significant financing component or risk of a significant revenue reversal
in these transactions due to the performance obligations and settlement of the transactions being on a daily basis. 

Cryptocurrency
Revenue 

During
2023, we generated revenue from the sale of cryptocurrency packages to our customers through an arrangement with a third-party supplier.
The various packages included different amounts of coin with differing rates of returns and terms. The coin is delivered by a third-party
supplier. The sale of cryptocurrency packages was discontinued during the year ended December 31, 2023. 

During
2023, we recognized cryptocurrency revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue is measured based on a consideration specified

was to arrange for the third-parties to provide coin and protection (if applicable) to our customers and payment was received from our
customers at the time of order placement. All customers were given two weeks to request a refund, therefore we would record a customer
advance on our balance sheet upon receipt of payment. After the two weeks have passed from order placement, we request our third-party

Operating
lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease
term. For leases in which the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on
the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We
have elected to not apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to short-term leases (leases with terms of twelve months or less).
 Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that
we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have elected the practical expedient and will not separate non-lease components from lease components and will instead account for

Class
B Units of Investview Financial Group Holdings, LLC 

As
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were Units of Class B Investview Financial Group Holdings, LLC issued
and outstanding. These units were issued as consideration for the purchase of operating assets and intellectual property rights of MPower,
a company controlled and partially owned by David B. Rothrock and James R. Bell, two of our board members. In order to properly account for the purchase transaction on the Company s financial
statements, we were required by applicable financial reporting standards to value the Class B Units issued to MPower in the transaction
as of the closing date of the MPower sale transaction (September 3, 2021). For these accounting purposes, we concluded that the fair
value of the consideration for financial accounting purposes, at the if-converted market value of the underlying common shares
was million, based on the closing market price of on the closing date of September 3, 2021, as discounted from million
by (or million) to reflect the significant lock up period. The fair value valuation of the Class B Units, however,
was completed relying on a certain set of methodologies that are accepted for accounting purposes, and is not necessarily indicative
of the fair market value that may be implied relative to such Units in a commercial transaction not governed by financial
reporting standards. In particular, the methodology used to value the Class B Units at their fair value did not take into
account any blockage discounts that may otherwise apply after the expiration of the lock-up period in 2025; while other valuation methodologies,
not bound by financial reporting codifications, would possibly determine that the blockage discount associated with the resale of 
million shares after the expiration of the lock-up period, into a marketplace that has limited market liquidity, could possibly have
a material downward influence on the valuation.

we suspended any further offering of the product protection option in the cryptocurrency packages after the third-party provider was
unable to comply with our standard vendor compliance protocols, citing certain offshore confidentiality entitlements. That suspension
will remain in place until we are able to further validate the continued integrity of the product protection and the vendor s ability
to honor its commitments to our members. We cannot ensure that such third-party provider will comply with its contractual requirements,
which could cause our members to not achieve the level of return on their investments expected. While we do not believe that we should
have any legal responsibility to the customers who participated in the TPP Program offered and administered by TPP, there is a risk that
any failure of TPP to perform its obligations to our customers, could expose us to claims of our customers that could have an adverse

The
Company s financial statements as of September 30, 2024, reflect a receivables balance of million.
Of that balance, million
represents receivables that arise out of credit card transactions generated by the Company s iGenius subsidiary. The credit
card transactions that arise out of the ordinary course operations of the Company s iGenius subsidiary, are processed by the
Company s credit card processors, in conjunction with their clearing banks. Over time, the balance of credit card collections
being held by one of our credit card processors and its clearing bank, which are legally supposed to be held for the benefit of the
Company, subject to coverage for chargebacks and other normal course collection issues, has increased to approximately million,
an amount that has been generally confirmed by the credit card processor. As they had been unresponsive to our repeated demands for
payment, claiming that they were in the process of concluding their internal accounting of the amounts due and status of our
accounts, in March 2024, the Company instituted a lawsuit against this credit card processor and its clearing bank seeking, among
other things, an accounting for and repayment of the withheld funds. Notwithstanding, to date, we have been unable, through
negotiations and through our lawsuit, to recover any amount of the receivable balances owed to us as the credit card processor
asserts, among others, that it continues to evaluate possible exposure to chargebacks and other normal course collection issues.
Recently, however, the Company s application for a pre-judgment writ of attachment against both the credit card processor and
the clearing bank, has been granted. Although the Company s collection efforts will likely be enhanced by application of the
pre-judgment writ of attachment, there can still be no assurances that the Company will be able to collect some or all of the funds
owed to it. Should the Company be unable to collect some or all of the funds owed, it will be caused to incur a corollary bad debt
expense of up to the uncollected amount which is currently approximately million.
Furthermore, the Company may be caused under generally accepted accounting principles, to incur a bad debt expense if it is
determined that the amounts owed to the Company are unlikely to be collected, although the Company has not yet reached that
conclusion. A charge of up to million,
which represents less than 10 of the Company s current assets, would not have a material adverse effect upon the
Company s long-term liquidity, however, could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s net earnings in the
period incurred.

ended September 30, 2024. The decrease can be explained by a 4.9 million decrease in our subscription revenue, 2.3 million decrease
in our mining revenue, and 146 thousand decrease in our cryptocurrency revenue. The 4.9 million (31 decrease in subscription revenue
was driven by the continued adverse impact of global inflation which caused a general slowdown in the direct sales and home based business
industry; the 2.3 million (80 decrease in mining revenue was a result of a number of factors, including, the Bitcoin Halving 
which occurred on April 19, 2024, and increase in Bitcoin Network Difficulty and a mandated power curtailment enforced by the government-controlled
utility company in Iceland, partially offset by an increase in the price of Bitcoin; and the 146 thousand (100 decrease in cryptocurrency
revenue was due to the discontinuation of our distribution of NDAU packages during the year ended December 31, 2023.

our subscription revenue, a decrease in cost of sales and services of 1.9 million, which was a result of a power curtailment mandated
by the government-controlled utility companies in Iceland, and a decrease in general and administrative expenses, which was a result
of decreases in credit card processing fees due to the decreases in our subscription revenue and decreases in costs related to our mining
operations. These decreases were offset by an increase in impairment expense of 977 thousand due to impairment of our data processing
equipment during the current period.

from other income of 69,821 recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The
change is due to a decrease in Other income (expense) in the current period of 137 thousand, as a result of a decrease in lease payments
received under a structured equipment lease agreement, offset with the recognition of more interest income in the current period due
to our cash balances being held in higher interest-bearing accounts, as compared to the equivalent prior year period. The decrease in
Other income (expense) was offset by a realized gain recorded on cryptocurrency in the current period of 2 thousand compared to a realized
loss of 58 thousand in the equivalent prior year period.

by the continued adverse impact of global inflation which caused a general slowdown in the direct sales and home based business industry;

other income of 270,116 recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change is due to a realized gain on cryptocurrency
in the current period of 284 thousand compared to a realized gain of 170 thousand in the equivalent prior year period and an increase
in Other income (expense) in the current period of 257 thousand, as we recognized more interest income in the current period due to
our cash balances being held in higher interest-bearing accounts, as compared to the equivalent prior year period, and as a result of
an increase in ticket sales from certain promotional events iGenius held during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we met our short- and long-term working capital and capital expenditure requirements, including
funding for operations, capital expenditures, growth initiatives, and for debt service on our outstanding indebtedness and dividends
on our Series B Preferred Stock, through net cash flows provided by operating activities. We believe we will have sufficient resources,
including cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, to meet debt service obligations in a timely manner and be able to
meet our objectives. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net income from operations of 1,627,011 and net income of 1,392,139. As of September
30, 2024, we have unrestricted cash of 24,452,902. Also, as of September 30, 2024, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities
to result in working capital of 17,421,468 and our cryptocurrency balance was reported at a cost basis of 461,674. Management does
not believe there are any liquidity issues as of September 30, 2024.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Basis
of Accounting 

Our
policy is to prepare our financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations (Regulation
S-X) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative
of the operating results that may be expected for our year ending December 31, 2024, as will be included in the filing of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the December 31, 2023, consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Investview, Inc., and our wholly owned subsidiaries: iGenius, LLC, SAFETek,
LLC, Investview Financial Group Holdings, LLC, Opencash Finance, Inc., Opencash Securities, LLC, Investview MTS, LLC, and MyLife Wellness
Company. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

Long-Lived
Assets Cryptocurrencies Intangible Assets 

We
account for our cryptocurrencies and intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 350-30, General Intangibles Other Than Goodwill, and ASC Subtopic 360-10-05, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. ASC Subtopic 350-30 requires assets to be measured based on the fair value of the
consideration given or the fair value of the assets (or net assets) acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus, more reliably
measurable. Our cryptocurrencies are deemed to have an indefinite useful life; therefore, amounts are not amortized, but rather are assessed
for impairment as further discussed in our impairment policy. Under ASC Subtopic 350-30 any intangible asset with a useful life is required
to be amortized over that life and the useful life is to be evaluated every reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances
warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of
the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Costs of internally developing, maintaining,
or restoring intangible assets are recognized as an expense when incurred. 

We
hold cryptocurrency-denominated assets and include them in our consolidated balance sheet as Other current assets. The value of our cryptocurrencies
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 461,674 and 585,632, respectively. Cryptocurrencies purchased or received for payment
from customers are recorded in accordance with ASC 350-30 and cryptocurrencies awarded to the Company through its mining activities 4,288,791
and 7,798,279 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively) are accounted for in connection with the Company s
revenue recognition policy. The use of cryptocurrencies is accounted for in accordance with the first in first out method of accounting.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded realized gains (losses) on our cryptocurrency transactions of 284,112
and 170,444, respectively. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

We
have adopted ASC Subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment. ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles held and used by us be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable or when the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. Events relating
to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses, or a forecasted inability to
achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. 

28 

We
evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual
disposition. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted and an impairment loss
is recorded equal to the difference between the asset s carrying value and fair value or disposable value. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we impaired data processing equipment 977,418. During the nine months ended September
30, 2023, no impairment was recorded. 

Subscription
Revenue 

Most
of our revenue is generated by membership and subscription sales and payment is received at the time of purchase. We recognize subscription
revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer and
recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract. Our performance obligation is to provide services over
a fixed subscription period; therefore, we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period and deferred revenue is recorded for
the portion of the subscription period subsequent to each reporting date. Additionally, we offer a designated trial period to first-time
subscription customers, during which a full refund can be requested if a customer does not wish to continue with the subscription. Revenues
are deferred during the trial period as collection is not probable until that time has passed. Revenues are presented net of refunds,
sales incentives, credits, and known and estimated credit card chargebacks. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our deferred
revenues were 2,365,008 and 2,703,398, respectively. 

Mining
Revenue 

We
generate revenue from mining bitcoin. The Company has entered into a digital asset mining pool by executing a contract, as amended from
time to time, with the mining pool operator to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contract is terminable at any time by
either party without penalty and the Company s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing
power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, we are entitled to a Full-Pay-Per-Share payout of Bitcoin
based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided by us to the mining pool as a percentage of total network
hash rate, and other inputs. We are entitled to consideration even if a block is not successfully placed by the mining pool operator. 

Providing
computing power to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the Bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as solving
a block is an output of the Company s ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only
performance obligation in the Company s contract with the mining pool operator. The transaction consideration the Company receives
is net of a contractually agreed upon pool fee percentage charged and kept by the mining pool operator and is noncash,
in the form of Bitcoin, which the Company measures at fair value on the date Bitcoin is received. This value is not materially different
than the fair value at the moment we meet the performance obligation, which can be recalculated based on the contractual formula. The
consideration is variable. The amount of consideration recognized is constrained to the amount of consideration received, which is when
it is probable a significant reversal will not occur. There is no significant financing component or risk of a significant revenue reversal
in these transactions due to the performance obligations and settlement of the transactions being on a daily basis. 

Cryptocurrency
Revenue 

During
2023, we generated revenue from the sale of cryptocurrency packages to our customers through an arrangement with a third-party supplier.
The various packages included different amounts of coin with differing rates of returns and terms. The coin is delivered by a third-party
supplier. The sale of cryptocurrency packages was discontinued during the year ended December 31, 2023. 

During
2023, we recognized cryptocurrency revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue is measured based on a consideration specified
in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract. Our performance obligation
was to arrange for the third-parties to provide coin and protection (if applicable) to our customers and payment was received from our
customers at the time of order placement. All customers were given two weeks to request a refund, therefore we would record a customer
advance on our balance sheet upon receipt of payment. After the two weeks have passed from order placement, we request our third-party
supplier to deliver coin and protection (if applicable), at which time we recognize revenue and the amounts due to our supplier on our
books. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we generated no revenue from the sale of cryptocurrency packages. 

29 

Mining
Equipment Repair Revenue 

Through
our wholly owned subsidiary, SAFETek, LLC, prior to June 30, 2023, we repaired broken mining equipment for sale to third-party customers.
Our mining equipment repair business was discontinued during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. 

Prior
to June 30, 2023, we recognized miner repair revenue in accordance with ASC 606-10 where revenue was measured based on a consideration
specified in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract. Our performance
obligation is to deliver the promised goods to our customers.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting
for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets . The amendments in ASU No. 2023-08 are intended to improve the accounting for certain crypto
assets by requiring an entity to measure those crypto assets at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized
in net income. The amendments also improve the information provided to investors about an entity s crypto asset holdings by requiring
disclosure about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions, and changes during the reporting period. The amendments are effective
for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption
is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued (or made available for issuance). If an entity
adopts the amendments in an interim period, it must adopt them as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
ASU No. 2023-08 requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components
of equity or net assets) as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. The Company has
not yet adopted ASU No. 2023-08 and is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption will have on the Company s financial statement
presentation and disclosures. 

We
have noted no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we believe are applicable or would have
a material impact on our financial statements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
revenues, and results of operations, liquidity, or capital expenditures. 

ITEM
3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide
the information under this item. 

ITEM
4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls
and procedures relative to their costs. 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure
control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded,
based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Controls 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

There
have been no material changes to this information since reported on in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023.

ITEM
1.A RISK FACTORS 

Except
as set forth below, there have been no material changes in the risk factors disclosed by us under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors contained
in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

During
2024, we instituted collection efforts through litigation against one of our credit card processors and its clearing bank as efforts
to account for and collect approximately 1.87 million of our credit card receivables that were supposed to have been held by them in
reserve, have not proven successful. 

The
Company s financial statements as of September 30, 2024, reflect a receivables balance of 2.48 million. Of that balance,
 2.47 million represents receivables that arise out of credit card transactions generated by the Company s iGenius subsidiary.
The credit card transactions that arise out of the ordinary course operations of the Company s iGenius subsidiary, are
processed by the Company s credit card processors, in conjunction with their clearing banks. Over time, the balance of credit
card collections being held by one of our credit card processors and its clearing bank, which are legally supposed to be held for
the benefit of the Company, subject to coverage for chargebacks and other normal course collection issues, has increased to
approximately 1.87 million; an amount that has been generally confirmed by the credit card processor. As they had been unresponsive
to our repeated demands for payment, claiming that they were in the process of concluding their internal accounting of the amounts
due and status of our accounts, in March 2024, the Company instituted a lawsuit against this credit card processor and its clearing
bank seeking, among other things, an accounting for and repayment of the withheld funds. Notwithstanding, to date, we have been
unable, through negotiations and through our lawsuit, to recover any amount of the receivable balances owed to us as the credit card
processor asserts, among others, that it continues to evaluate possible exposure to chargebacks and other normal course collection
issues. Recently, however, the Company s application for a pre-judgment writ of attachment against both the credit card
processor and the clearing bank, has been granted. Although the Company s collection efforts will likely be enhanced by
application of the pre-judgment writ of attachment, there can still be no assurances that the Company will be able to collect some
or all of the funds owed to it. Should the Company be unable to collect some or all of the funds owed, it will be caused to incur a
corollary bad debt expense of up to the uncollected amount which is currently approximately 1.87 million. Furthermore, the Company
may be caused under generally accepted accounting principles, to incur a bad debt expense if it is determined that the amounts owed
to the Company are unlikely to be collected, although the Company has not yet reached that conclusion. A charge of up to 1.87
million, which represents less than 10 of the Company s current assets, would not have a material adverse effect upon the
Company s long-term liquidity, however, could have a material adverse effect upon the Company s net earnings in the
period incurred. 

Our business could be
negatively affected if we are required to defend allegations that our direct selling activities are fraudulent or deceptive schemes, against
public interest, or involve the sale of unregistered securities. 

 Our iGenius products and services are marketed
by a global network of independent distributors using a direct selling business model. Although we believe that our direct selling
business model is generally in compliance with applicable legal standards, direct selling programs, in general, have often been the
target of regulatory scrutiny by federal, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States and foreign countries,
including the FTC. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to
as pyramid schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant
emphasis on product sales, whereas the more successful direct selling business models have and emphasize sales of products and
services. The regulatory requirements concerning direct selling programs do not include bright line rules and are
inherently fact-based and, thus, we are subject to the risk that these regulations or the enforcement or interpretation of these
regulations by regulators or courts can change. The adoption of new regulations, or changes in the interpretations or enforcement of
existing regulations, may result in significant compliance costs or require us to change or cease aspects of our network marketing
program. In addition, the ambiguity surrounding these regulations can also affect the public perception of our business. In the
normal course of operations, we have periodically received inquiries from foreign or domestic regulators relative to matters of this
nature. In addition, from time to time, we receive notices or formal actions from foreign or domestic regulatory authorities or
administrative agencies, that assert that the activities of certain of our independent distributors, as well as our iGenius business
unit, as it generally relates to that component of our business that provides financial education and related tools, or introduces
our customers to, financial products or licensed third-parties who offer financial advice or products, constitute unlicensed
activities as an unregistered securities dealer or advisor under local laws. However, we do not believe that this component of our
business violates any such laws as we believe we are merely a provider of financial education and related tools that access
information that is available publicly or without a licensing requirement, or that through affinity programs provide access to
services or products offered by third parties neither owned or operated by iGenius, who are appropriately licensed or registered.
When we are confronted with such allegations, we may either elect to challenge the legal basis thereof when we believe it is
appropriate or economically compelling, or in the instances in which the financial impact of the relief sought is de minimis, we may
elect to settle with any such regulator, often without admitting any violation of law.
