Remaining
Performance Obligations 

Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of
orders meeting the definition of a contract for which work has not been performed or has been partially performed and excludes unexercised
contract options. The duration of the majority of our contracts, as defined by ASC Topic 606, is less than one year. The Company has elected
to apply the practical expedient, which allows the Company to exclude remaining performance obligations with an original expected duration
of one year or less. The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for such contracts with
a duration of more than one year was approximately at September 28, 2024. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately
 and of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 and 24 months, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter.

and , respectively, and included within prepaid expenses
and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The increase in contract assets was primarily due to the recognition of
revenue related to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of performance obligations prior to billing, partially offset by amounts
billed to customers during the period. As of September 28, 2024 and March 30, 2024, the Company did not have any contract assets classified
as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Contract
Liabilities (Deferred Revenue) - The Company may receive a customer advance or deposit, or have an unconditional right to receive
a customer advance, prior to revenue being recognized. Since the performance obligations related to such advances may not have been satisfied,
a contract liability is established. Advance payments are not considered a significant financing component as the timing of the transfer
of the related goods or services is at the discretion of the customer. 

As of September 28, 2024
and March 30, 2024, current contract liabilities were and , respectively, and are included within accrued expenses and other
current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The increase in current contract liabilities was primarily due to advance payments
received and the reclassification of a portion of advance payments received from the noncurrent portion of contract liabilities partially
offset by revenue recognized on customer contracts. For the three and six months ended September 28, 2024, the Company recognized revenues
of and that were included in the current contract liability balance as of March 30, 2024. For the three and six months ended
September 30, 2023, the Company recognized revenues of and that were included in the current contract liability balance at
April 1, 2023. 

As
of September 28, 2024 and March 30, 2024, noncurrent contract liabilities were and , respectively, and included within other
noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in noncurrent contract liabilities was primarily due to the reclassification
of a portion of advance payments received to the current portion of contract liabilities. 

Variable
Consideration 

The
amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods and services is not generally subject to significant
variations. However, the Company does offer certain customers rebates, prompt payment discounts, end-user discounts and the right to
return eligible products. The Company estimates this variable consideration using the expected value amount, which is based on historical
experience. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal
of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company
adjusts the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive changes or when the
consideration becomes fixed. Accrued customer rebates were and at September 28, 2024 and March 30, 2024, respectively, and
are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Series A Mandatory
Convertible Preferred Stock (the MCPS to common shares. 

We exclude outstanding stock
options, stock awards and the MCPS from the calculations if the effect would be anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of the MCPS is calculated
using the if-converted method. The if-converted method assumes that these securities were converted to shares of common stock at the beginning
of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive. If the effect is anti-dilutive, we calculate net income per share attributable
to common stockholders by adjusting the numerator for the effect of the cumulative MCPS dividends for the respective period. 

During the three-month period
ended September 28, 2024, certain holders of the MCPS elected to exercise their right to convert their MCPS shares into common shares
prior to the mandatory conversion date of October 15, 2024. This resulted in MCPS shares being converted to common shares during
the period. 

As of September 28, 2024 and
September 30, 2023, there were and MCPS shares outstanding, respectively. For the three-month and six-month periods
ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, the effect of assuming the conversion of these MCPS shares into shares
of common stock was anti-dilutive, and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders.
Accordingly, net income was reduced by cumulative MCPS dividends, as presented in our consolidated statement of operations, for purposes
of calculating the numerator in the diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders. 

For the three months ended
September 28, 2024, employee stock options and no restricted shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per
share attributable to common stockholders. For the six months ended September 28, 2024, employee stock options and restricted
shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders. The inclusion of these employee
stock options and restricted shares would have been anti-dilutive. 

10 

employee stock options and no restricted shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per
share attributable to common stockholders. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, employee stock options and restricted
shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders. The inclusion of these employee
stock options and restricted shares would have been anti-dilutive.

fair value of long-term fixed-rate debt was measured using Level 1 inputs. Due to the nature of fair value calculations for variable-rate
debt, the carrying value of the Company s long-term variable-rate debt is a reasonable estimate of its fair value. 

The
fair value of the interest rate swap was ) at September 28, 2024 and included in other noncurrent liabilities on the Company s
consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the interest rate swap was at March 30, 2024, and included in other noncurrent assets
on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the interest rate swap is measured using Level 2 inputs. 

The fair value of the cross currency swap was

value of the cross currency swap was measured using Level 2 inputs.

Debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Agreement totaled and are being amortized over the life of the Credit Agreement. 

Initially, A portion of the Term Loan is subject to a fixed-rate interest swap
as discussed in Note 13. 

The
Term Loan matures in November 2026 and amortizes in quarterly installments with the balance payable on the maturity date. The Company
can elect to prepay some or all of the outstanding balance from time to time without penalty, which will offset future quarterly amortization
installments. Due to prepayments previously made, the required future principal payments on the Term Loan are for fiscal 2025, 
for fiscal 2026, and for fiscal 2027. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in November 2026, at which time all amounts outstanding
under the Revolving Credit Facility will be payable. 

As of September 28, 2024 the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. 

The
Credit Agreement allows the Company to, among other things, make distributions to stockholders, repurchase its stock, incur other debt
or liens, or acquire or dispose of assets provided that the Company complies with certain requirements and limitations of the Credit
Agreement.

proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were approximately , after deducting initial purchasers discounts and commissions
and offering expenses, and were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Dodge. 

The
Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the Indenture ).

limitations and qualifications. At any time that the Senior Notes are rated investment grade, certain of these covenants will be suspended. 

The
Senior Notes are guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior unsecured basis by RBC Bearings and RBCA s domestic subsidiaries
that also guarantee the Credit Agreement. 

Interest

year. 

The Senior Notes will mature
on . The Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time on or after October 15, 2024 at the redemption
prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company sells
certain of its assets or experiences specific kinds of changes in control, the Company must offer to purchase the Senior Notes.

The
effective income tax rates for the three-month periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, were and , respectively.
In addition to discrete items, the effective income tax rates for both these periods were different from the U.S. statutory rates due
to the foreign-derived intangible income provision and U.S. credit for increasing research activities, which decreased the rate, and
state income taxes, foreign income taxes, and nondeductible compensation, which increased the rate. 

The

with stock-based compensation partially offset by of other discrete tax expenses. The effective income tax rate without discrete
items for the three-month period ended September 28, 2024 would have been . The effective income tax rate for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2023 of included of discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. The effective income
tax rate without discrete items for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 would have been . The Company believes it is
reasonably possible that some of its unrecognized tax positions may be effectively settled within the next 12 months due to the closing
of audits and the statute of limitations expiring in various jurisdictions. The decrease in the Company s unrecognized tax positions,
pertaining primarily to federal and state credits and state tax, is estimated to be approximately .

Minimum Tax 

In October 2021, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules
defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of . Subsequently
multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. Many non-US tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to
adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 with the adoption of additional components in later years or
announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending
legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions in which we operate. At this time, we do not anticipate the
enacted or pending legislation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

The dividend on the MCPS that
accrued through the conversion date was paid on the conversion date to holders of record on October 1, 2024 and therefore was not factored
into the conversion rate. 

The Company issued 
shares of common stock upon the conversion of the MCPS. 

Because the MCPS is no longer
outstanding, the Company will not pay dividends on the MCPS in the future. This will amount to a cash savings of per year.

Overview 

We
are a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered precision bearings, components and essential systems for the industrial,
aerospace and defense industries. Our precision solutions are integral to the manufacture and operation of most machines and mechanical
systems, reduce wear to moving parts, facilitate proper power transmission, and reduce damage and energy loss caused by friction. While
we manufacture products in all major bearings categories, we focus primarily on the higher end of the bearing and engineered component
markets where we believe our value-added manufacturing and engineering capabilities enable us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors
and enhance profitability. We believe our expertise has enabled us to garner leading positions in many of the product markets in which
we primarily compete. With 52 facilities in 11 countries, of which 37 are manufacturing facilities, we have been able to significantly
broaden our end markets, products, customer base and geographic reach. 

Our
chief operating decision maker (CODM) makes operating decisions, assesses the performance of the business, and allocates resources under
two reportable business segments Aerospace/Defense and Industrial: 

Aerospace/Defense.
 This segment represents the end markets for the Company s highly engineered bearings and precision components used in commercial
aerospace, defense aerospace, and marine and ground defense applications. 

Industrial.
 This segment represents the end markets for the Company s highly engineered bearings, gearings and precision components
used in various industrial applications including: power transmission; construction, mining, energy and specialized equipment manufacturing;
semiconductor production equipment manufacturing; agricultural machinery, commercial truck and automotive manufacturing; and tool holding. 

The
markets for our products are cyclical, and we have endeavored to mitigate this cyclicality by entering into single and sole-source relationships
and long-term purchase agreements, through diversification across multiple market segments within the Aerospace/Defense and Industrial
segments, by increasing sales to the aftermarket, and by focusing on developing highly customized solutions. 

Currently,
our strategy is built around maintaining our role as a leading manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and precision components through
the following efforts: 

Developing
innovative solutions . By leveraging our design and manufacturing expertise and our extensive customer relationships, we continue
to develop new products for markets in which there are substantial growth opportunities. 

Expanding
customer base and penetrating end markets . We continually seek opportunities to access new customers, geographic locations and
bearing platforms with existing products or profitable new product opportunities. 

Increasing
aftermarket sales. We believe that increasing our aftermarket sales of replacement parts will further enhance the continuity
and predictability of our revenues and enhance our profitability. Such sales include sales to third party distributors and sales to OEMs
for replacement products and aftermarket services. The acquisition of Dodge has had a profound impact on our sales volumes to distributors
and other aftermarket customers. We will further increase the percentage of our revenues derived from the replacement market by continuing
to implement several initiatives. 

Pursuing
selective acquisitions. The acquisition of businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and continues to be an
important element of our business strategy. We believe that there will continue to be consolidation within the industry that may present
us with acquisition opportunities. 

Outlook 

Our net sales for the three-month
period ended September 28, 2024 increased 3.2 compared to the same period last fiscal year. The increase in net sales was a result of
a 12.5 increase in our Aerospace/Defense segment partially offset by a 1.4 decrease in our Industrial segment. Our backlog, as of September
28, 2024 was 864.0 compared to 821.5 as of March 30, 2024. 

We
are continuing to see the expansion of our commercial aerospace business, which experienced a 10.3 increase in net sales for the three-month
period ended September 28, 2024 versus the same period last fiscal year. We anticipate this growth to continue through the rest of the
current fiscal year and beyond. Orders have continued to grow as evidenced by our backlog. Defense sales, which represented approximately
33.3 of segment sales during the quarter, were up 17.3 quarter over quarter. We expect this growth to continue throughout the current
fiscal year and beyond as we are gearing up to fulfill the substantial number of defense orders in our backlog. Though sales in our Industrial
segment have decreased compared to the comparable period in the prior year, our margins have continued to improve driven by continuous
operational improvements and product mix. 

20 

The Company expects net sales to be approximately
 390.0 to 400.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 4.3 to 7.0 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 

We believe that operating
cash flows and available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility will provide adequate resources to fund internal growth initiatives
for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. As of September 28, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 89.1,
of which approximately 22.8 was cash held by our foreign subsidiaries.

Our net sales for the three-month
period ended September 28, 2024 increased 3.2 compared to the same period last fiscal year. Net sales in our Industrial segment decreased
1.4 quarter over quarter. While stable overall, we saw strength in the mining and metals and warehousing markets offset by weakness in
semicon and oil and gas sales compared to the prior year. Net sales in our Aerospace/Defense segment increased 12.5 quarter over quarter,
led by defense sales, which increased 17.3 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by aerospace and marine. Aerospace commercial
OEM and the aftermarket were up 10.3 compared to the same period in the prior year. Net sales during the quarter ended September 28,
2024 were adversely effected by a temporary stoppage of shipping and receiving activities at certain of our facilities due to local flooding
caused by Hurricane Helene, as well as a shipping slowdown to one of our commercial aerospace OEM customers that is experiencing a labor
strike. We estimate the impact to net sales from these events to have been between 4.0 and 5.0 during the quarter. 

Net
income attributable to common stockholders for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 48.5 compared to 45.9 for the same period last

power generation, logistics and warehousing and grain markets offset by semicon and oil and gas. Net sales in our Aerospace/Defense segment
increased 18.0 year over year, led by the defense sector which was up 27.3 compared to the same period in the prior year while net sales
to the commercial aerospace sector were up 13.7 . The increase in the defense sector reflects continued strength and stability from our
large OEMs and the aftermarket.

to the debt reduction efforts made by the Company over the past fiscal year, the Interest Rate Swap (which has enabled us to manage interest
costs as approximately 82 of our debt bears interest at a fixed rate, after giving effect to the Interest Rate Swap), and the Cross
Currency Swap. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for more information regarding the Interest Rate Swap and the Cross

orders we have seen in recent periods in the OEM markets and expansion in the aftermarket. Our defense markets, which consisted of 35.5
of OEM and 12.2 of distribution and aftermarket, increased by 17.3 compared to fiscal 2024 when OEM net sales were 34.9 and distribution
and aftermarket net sales were 5.7. The increase in defense sales was driven by marine, helicopters and missiles.

Net sales increased 44.5,
or 18.0 , for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period last fiscal year. The 18.0 increase was primarily driven
by a 27.3 increase in our defense market, while our commercial aerospace market was up 13.7 year over year. Commercial aerospace, which
consisted of 153.9 of OEM and 38.9 of distribution and aftermarket, increased by 13.7 compared to fiscal 2024 when OEM net sales were
 133.1 and distribution and aftermarket net sales were 36.5. Our defense markets, which consisted of 75.7 of OEM and 23.8 of distribution
and aftermarket, increased by 27.3 compared to fiscal 2024 when OEM net sales were 65.2 and distribution and aftermarket net sales were
 13.0. 

Gross
margin as a percentage of segment net sales was 41.0 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 39.5 for the same period last
fiscal year. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by efficiencies achieved at the plants in
part due to increased sales volumes and favorable product mix.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our capital requirements include
manufacturing equipment and materials. We have historically fueled our growth, in part, through acquisitions, including the Dodge acquisition
completed in fiscal 2022 and the Specline acquisition completed in fiscal 2024. We have historically met our working capital, capital
expenditure and acquisition funding needs through our net cash flows provided by operations, various debt arrangements and public sales
of equity. We believe that operating cash flows and available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility (which expires in November 2026)
will provide adequate resources to fund internal growth initiatives for the foreseeable future. 

Our ability to meet future working capital, capital
expenditure and debt service requirements will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic,
competitive and business factors, particularly interest rates, cyclical changes in our end markets, and our ability to pass through raw
material price increases on a timely basis, many of which are outside of our control. In addition, future acquisitions could have a significant
impact on our liquidity position and our need for additional funds. 

From time to time, we evaluate our existing facilities and operations and their strategic
importance to us. If we determine that a given facility or operation does not have future strategic importance, we may sell, relocate,
consolidate or otherwise dispose of that facility or operations. Although we believe our operations would not be materially adversely
affected by such dispositions, relocations or consolidations, we could incur significant cash or non-cash charges in connection with them. 

Liquidity 

As of September 28, 2024, we had cash and cash
equivalents of 89.1, of which approximately 22.8 was cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. We expect that our undistributed foreign
earnings will be re-invested indefinitely for working capital, internal growth, and acquisitions for and by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. 

Domestic Credit Facility 

The Credit Agreement, which
was entered into in fiscal 2022, provides the Company with (a) the 1,300.0 Term Loan, which was used to fund a portion of the purchase
price for the acquisition of Dodge and to pay related fees and expenses, and (b) the 500.0 Revolving Credit Facility. Debt issuance
costs associated with the Credit Agreement totaled 14.9 and are being amortized over the life of the Credit Agreement. 

Initially, amounts outstanding under the
Facilities generally bore interest, at the Company s option, at either, (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of
(i) Wells Fargo s prime lending rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1.00 and (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate
plus 1.00 or (b) the LIBOR rate plus a specified margin, depending on the type of borrowing being made. The applicable margin was based
on the Company s consolidated ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from time to time.
In December 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to replace LIBOR with the secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York (i.e., SOFR) so that borrowings under the Facilities denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 , plus a margin ranging from 0.75 
to 2.00 depending on the Company s consolidated ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDA. The Facilities are subject to a
SOFR floor of 0.00 . As of September 28, 2024, the Company s margin was 1.00 for SOFR loans, the commitment fee rate was 0.175 ,
and the letter of credit fee rate was 1.00 . A portion of the Term Loan is subject to the Interest Rate Swap. 

The Term Loan matures in November
2026 and amortizes in quarterly installments with the balance payable on the maturity date. The Company can elect to prepay some or all
of the outstanding balance from time to time without penalty, which will offset future quarterly amortization installments. Due to prepayments
previously made, the required future principal payments on the Term Loan are 0 for fiscal 2025, 0 for fiscal 2026, and 600.0 for
fiscal 2027. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in November 2026, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility will be payable. 

28 

The Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply
with various covenants, including the following financial covenants: (a) a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) of 5.00:1.00, which maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio shall decrease during certain subsequent test periods as set forth in
the Credit Agreement (provided that, no more than once during the term of the Facilities, such maximum ratio applicable at such time may
be increased by the Company by 0.50:1.00 for a period of 12 months after the consummation of a material acquisition); and (b) a minimum
Interest Coverage Ratio of 2.00:1.00. As of September 28, 2024 the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. 

The Credit Agreement allows
the Company to, among other things, make distributions to stockholders, repurchase its stock, incur other debt or liens, or acquire or
dispose of assets provided that the Company complies with certain requirements and limitations of the Credit Agreement. 

The Company s domestic
subsidiaries have guaranteed the Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the Company s obligations and the domestic
subsidiaries guaranty are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries. 

As of September 28, 2024, 600.0 was outstanding
under the Term Loan and 3.7 of the Revolving Credit Facility was being utilized to provide letters of credit to secure the Company s
obligations relating to certain insurance programs. The Company had the ability to borrow an additional 496.3 under the Revolving
Credit Facility as of September 28, 2024. On September 30, 2024, the Company paid 32.0 on the Term Loan. 

Senior Notes 

In fiscal 2022, RBCA issued
 500.0 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were approximately 492.0,
after deducting initial purchasers discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and were used to fund a portion of the cash
purchase price for the acquisition of Dodge. 

The Senior Notes were issued
pursuant to the Indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture contains covenants limiting the ability
of the Company to (i) incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness, (ii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other
distributions to stockholders, (iii) make investments, (iv) create liens or use assets as security in other transactions, (v) merge or
consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of its assets, (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates, and
(vii) sell or transfer certain assets. These covenants contain various exceptions, limitations and qualifications. At any time that the
Senior Notes are rated investment grade, certain of these covenants will be suspended. 

The Senior Notes are guaranteed
jointly and severally on a senior unsecured basis by RBC Bearings and RBCA s domestic subsidiaries that also guarantee the Credit
Agreement. 

Interest on the Senior Notes
accrues at a rate of 4.375 and is payable semi annually in cash in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. 

The Senior Notes will mature on October 15, 2029.
The Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time on or after October 15, 2024 at the redemption prices set forth in
the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company sells certain of its assets
or experiences specific kinds of changes in control, the Company must offer to purchase the Senior Notes. 

29 

Foreign Borrowing Arrangements 

The Foreign Credit Line is a CHF 5.0 (approximately
 5.9 USD) credit line with Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd. to provide our Swiss subsidiary, Schaublin SA, future working capital,
if necessary. As of September 28, 2024, 0.1 was being utilized to provide a bank guarantee. Fees associated with the Foreign Credit
Line are nominal. 

In July 2024, Swiss Tool Systems,
one of our foreign subsidiaries, purchased the building where it operates for CHF 7.1 (approximately 8.4 USD) and took out a 10-year
fixed-rate mortgage on the building for CHF 4.0 (approximately 4.5 USD). 

Interest Rate Swap 

The Company is exposed to
market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates. 

To hedge against this risk,
in fiscal 2023, the Company entered into the Interest Rate Swap with a third-party financial counterparty under the Credit Agreement.
The Interest Rate Swap was executed to protect the Company from interest rate volatility on our variable-rate Term Loan. The Interest
Rate Swap became effective December 30, 2022 and is comprised of a 600.0 notional with a maturity of three years. The notional was 400.0
as of September 28, 2024. We receive a variable rate based on one-month Term SOFR and pay a fixed rate of 4.455 . As of September 28,
2024, approximately 82 of our debt bore interest at a fixed rate after giving effect to the Interest Rate Swap in place. The notional
on the Interest Rate Swap amortizes as follows: 

Year 1: 600.0 

Year 2: 400.0 

Year 3: 100.0 

The Interest Rate Swap
has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the first unhedged interest payments (the hedged transactions) paid
over the hedging relationship s specified time period of three years attributable to the borrowing s contractually
specified interest index on the hedged principal of its general borrowing program or replacement or refinancing thereof. 

Cross Currency Swap 

The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations as some of our subsidiaries operate in various countries. 

On August 12, 2024, the Company entered into the Cross Currency Swap
with a third-party financial counterparty. The objective of the Cross Currency Swap is to economically hedge the Company s net investment
in its lower-tier European subsidiary, Schaublin, against adverse changes in the Swiss franc/U.S. dollar exchange rate. The Cross Currency
Swap is based upon a net investment of CHF 69.4 80.0 USD) notional amount with a three-year maturity date. RBC receives a fixed U.S.
dollar amount on a month-to-month basis based upon a fixed annual rate of 2.77 of the notional amount. At maturity, RBC will net-settle
the principal of the Cross Currency Swap in cash with the counterparty. The Cross Currency Swap has been designated as a net investment
hedge on an after-tax basis.

During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we
generated cash of 140.4 from operating activities compared to 114.8 during the same period of fiscal 2024. The increase of 25.6 was
the result of an increase in net income of 13.9 and a favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of 12.7, partially offset
by the unfavorable impact of non-cash activity of 1.0. The favorable change in operating assets and liabilities is detailed in the table
below. The change in non-cash activity was driven by 4.0 more in stock-based compensation and 0.5 more in depreciation and amortization,
offset by 3.7 more in deferred taxes, 0.6 less in amortization of deferred financing costs, 0.6 less in consolidation and restructuring
charges, 0.3 less in losses on asset dispositions and 0.3 less in noncash operating lease expense.

During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we
used 25.2 for investing activities as compared to 32.5 used in the first six months of fiscal 2024. This decrease in cash used was primarily
attributable to a 18.7 decrease in business acquisition costs while capital expenditures increased 11.0 period over period. 

During the first six months
of fiscal 2025, we used cash of 89.0 for financing activities compared to 90.4 in the first six months of fiscal 2024. This decrease
in cash used was primarily attributable to 22.2 more exercises of stock-based awards and 4.5 received from proceeds related to the Swiss
Tool mortgage, partially offset by 18.0 less in proceeds received in drawdowns from our revolving credit facility, 5.4 more payments
made on outstanding debt, 0.5 more principal payments made on finance lease obligations and 1.4 more repurchases of common stock. 

31 

Capital Expenditures 

Our capital expenditures were
 25.2 for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 14.2 for the same period in the prior fiscal year. We expect to make additional
capital expenditures of 20.0 to 25.0 during the remainder of fiscal 2025 in connection with our existing business. We expect to fund
these capital expenditures principally through existing cash and internally generated funds. We may also make substantial additional capital
expenditures in connection with acquisitions. 

Obligations and Commitments 

The Company s fixed contractual obligations
and commitments are primarily comprised of our debt obligations disclosed in Note 10 in Part I, Item 1 of this report. We also have lease
obligations which are materially consistent with what we disclosed in our Annual Report. 

Other Matters 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Preparation of our financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. We believe the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements,
result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report
describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Actual results
in these areas could differ from management s estimates. There were no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates
during the first six months of fiscal 2025. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has 3.7 of outstanding
standby letters of credit, all of which are under the Revolving Credit Facility. We also have a contractual obligation for licenses related
to the implementation and upgrade of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The remaining contractual obligation related to these
ERP license costs of 7.6 will end in June of 2026. 

Other than the items noted
above, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 28, 2024. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are exposed to market risks
that arise during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 

Interest Rates. 
We currently have variable rate debt outstanding under the Term Loan. We regularly evaluate the impact of interest rate changes on
our net income and cash flow and take action to limit our exposure when appropriate. As discussed in Note 13 in Part I, Item 1 of
this report, we have utilized an interest rate swap to fix a portion of the variable rate interest expense associated with the Term
Loan. As of September 28, 2024, approximately 82 of our debt bears interest at a fixed rate, after giving effect to the interest
rate swap agreement in place. 

32 

Foreign Currency Exchange
Rates. Our operations in the following countries utilize the following currencies as their functional currency: 

Australia 
 Australian dollar 

India 
 rupee 

Canada Canadian
 dollar 

Mexico peso 

China Chinese yuan 

Poland zloty 

France and Germany 
 euro 

Switzerland Swiss
 franc 

England British
 pound 

As a result, we are exposed to risk associated
with fluctuating currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and these currencies. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
included in earnings. Approximately 11 of our net sales were impacted by foreign currency fluctuations for both the three- and six-month
periods ended September 28, 2024. Approximately 11 and 12 of our net sales were impacted by foreign currency fluctuations for the three-
and six-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For those foreign countries where we have sales, a strengthening in the
U.S. dollar as we have seen over the past few years or devaluation in the local currency would reduce the value of our local inventory
as presented in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, a stronger U.S. dollar or a weaker local currency would result in
reduced net sales, operating profit and shareholders equity due to the impact of foreign exchange translation on our consolidated financial
statements. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may make our products more expensive for others to purchase or increase our
operating costs, affecting our competitiveness and our profitability. 

Changes in exchange rates
between the U.S. dollar and other currencies and volatile economic, political and market conditions in emerging market countries have
in the past adversely affected our financial performance and may in the future adversely affect the value of our assets located outside
the United States, our gross profit and our results of operations. 

We periodically enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce
the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on our business. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had a cross currency swap, which is
discussed in further detail within Notes 6 and 13 in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of September
28, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 28, 2024,
our disclosure controls and procedures were (1) designed to ensure that information relating to our Company required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (2) effective, in that they
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. 

Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred
during the first six months of fiscal 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
