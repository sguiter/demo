shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), generating gross proceeds of , which is described
in Note 3, and the sale of Units (the Private Placement Units at a price of per Private Placement Unit
in a private placement to the Sponsors, that was closed simultaneously with the IPO. 

Transaction
costs amounted to (net
of underwriters cash reimbursement of deferred offering cost), consisting of 
 of cash underwriting fees, 
 of deferred underwriting commission and 
 (net of underwriters cash reimbursement of deferred offering
cost) of other offering costs. These costs were charged
to additional paid-in capital or accumulated deficit to the extent additional paid-in capital is fully depleted upon completion of the
IPO. 

The
Company will have until 12 months from the closing of this offering (or up to 21 months, if we extend the time to complete a business
combination as described in this prospectus), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as
promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem of the public shares, at a per-share price,
payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to of interest to pay liquidation and dissolution
expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders 
rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii)
as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of
directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law. 

The
Trust Account 

As
of September 23, 2024, a total of 
 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering,
including proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units, was deposited in a trust account (the Trust Account and
will be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with
a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund investing solely
in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until
the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s
shareholders, as described below. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank account, and working capital of . Further, the Company
has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans in pursuit of a Business
Combination. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s
Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period,
the Company s board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company.
There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period.
As a result, management has determined that such additional condition also raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Further,
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do
not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of
such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public
or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company which
is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

in investments held in the Trust Account comprised of money market funds that invest
in U.S. government securities. Investments in money market funds are presented on the balance sheets at fair value at the end of each
reporting period. Earnings on investments held in the Trust Account are included in interest earned on investments held in the Trust
Account in the accompanying statement of operations. The estimated fair value of investments held in the Trust Account is determined
using available market information. 

. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not experienced
losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts. Any loss incurred
or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations,
and cash flows.

unrecognized tax benefits and amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30,
2024. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation
from its position. 

There
is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations,
income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company s financial statement. 

The
Company may be subject to potential examination by foreign taxing authorities in the area of income taxes. These potential examinations
may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with
foreign tax laws. 

Any
interest payable in respect to US debt obligations held in the Trust Account is intended to qualify for the portfolio interest exemption
or otherwise be exempt from U.S. withholding taxes. Furthermore, shareholders of the Company may be subject to tax in their respective
jurisdictions based on applicable laws. For instance, U.S. persons may be subject to tax on the amounts deemed received depending on
whether the Company is a passive foreign investment company and whether U.S. persons have made any applicable tax elections permitted
under applicable law.

ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of
redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid in capital or accumulated deficit if additional
paid-in capital has no outstanding balance at the period end. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and for the period from May 27, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, the Company recorded

Units at a price of per Unit. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share and one
right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination. Ten
Public Rights will entitle the holder to one ordinary share (see Note 7). The Company will not issue fractional shares and only whole
shares will trade, so unless a holder purchased units in multiples of tens, such holder will not be able to receive or trade the fractional
shares underlying the rights. The Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional units
to cover over-allotments. 

Private Placement Units. Each Unit consists of one share
of ordinary shares and one right to receive one-tenths (1/10) of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of the Company s initial
Business Combination. The proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units were added to the net proceeds from the IPO held in the
Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the
Private Placement Units held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements
of applicable law). The Private Placement Units (including the underlying securities) will not be transferable, assignable, or salable
until the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain exceptions. 

of the Company s ordinary shares in exchange for paid for deferred offering
costs borne by the Sponsors. Up to of such founder shares are subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters 
over-allotment is not exercised in full. 

On
May 30, 2024, Cayson Holding LP, one of the Company s sponsors, transferred an aggregate of founder shares to Yawei Cao,
the Company s other sponsor, Chairman and CEO. 

On
May 30, 2024, the Company issued to EBC EBC founder shares for a purchase price of approximately per share and an aggregate
purchase price of . As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received payment for the purchase of the EBC Founder Shares. The Company estimated the fair value of the EBC Founder Shares to be or per share. Accordingly,
 (the total fair value less to be paid by EBC) was considered to be deferred offering cost. The Company established
the initial fair value for the EBC Founder Shares on May 30, 2024, the date of the issuance, using a calculation prepared by management
which takes into consideration the probability of completion of the Initial Public Offering, an implied probability of the completion
of a Business Combination and a Discount for Lack of Marketability calculation. The EBC Founder Shares, are classified as Level 3 at
the measurement date due to the use of unobservable inputs including the probability of a business combination, the probability of the
initial public offering, and other risk factors. 

The
Founder Shares and EBC Founder Shares are identical to the ordinary shares included in the Public Units, and holders of Founder Shares
and EBC Founder Shares have the same shareholder rights as public shareholders, except that (i) the Founder Shares and EBC Founder shares
are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described below; (ii) the initial shareholders and EBC have agreed (A) to waive their
redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and EBC Founder Shares in connection with the completion of the initial Business
Combination, (B) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and EBC Founder Shares in connection with a shareholder
vote to approve an amendment to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (a) modify the substance or timing
of the obligation to provide for the redemption of the Public Shares in connection with an initial Business Combination or to redeem
 of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within 12 months from the closing of this
offering (or up to 21 months, if we extend the time to complete an initial business combination as described in the prospectus) from
the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (b) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights
or pre-initial Business Combination activity, and (C) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with
respect to any Founder Shares and EBC Founder Shares held by them if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within
12 months from the closing of this offering (or up to 21 months, if we extend the time to complete an initial business combination as
described in the prospectus), and (iii) the Founder Shares and EBC Founder Shares are entitled to registration rights. If the Company
submits the initial Business Combination to the public shareholders for a vote, the initial shareholders have agreed (and their permitted
transferees will agree) to vote any Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased by them in or after the Initial Public Offering (including
in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of the initial Business Combination. 

The
Sponsors have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur
of: (A) six months after the date of the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, (B) any time after the 90 th day
after the consummation of an Initial Business Combination where the volume weighted average price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds
 (as adjusted for share splits, dividends, combinations or similar actions) for twenty trading days out of any thirty consecutive
trading day period or (C) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction
after our initial business combination that results in all of our public shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares
for cash, securities or other property. 

EBC
founder shares will not, subject to certain exceptions, be transferred, assignable, or salable (except to permitted transferees as described
in the Registration Statement (defined below)) until 30 days after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination. 

Promissory
Note Related Party 

On
June 3, 2024, the Sponsors issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the Promissory Note ), pursuant to which
the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of . The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the
earlier of (i) December 31, 2024, or (ii) the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. On the date of closing of the IPO on September
23, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Promissory Note and the Promissory Note then expired upon the consummation of the IPO.

 Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a business combination, each holder of a right will
automatically receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of the initial business combination. The Company will
not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole
share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Cayman law. In the event the Company is not the surviving
company upon completion of the initial business combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her
or its rights in order to receive the one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share underlying each right upon consummation of the business
combination. If the Company is unable to complete the initial business combination within the required time period and the Company will

and the rights will expire worthless. 

Founder Shares

2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

References
to the Company, our, us or we refer to Cayson Acquisition Corp. The following
discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
financial statements and the notes related thereto. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes
forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a
result of many factors . 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. While we intend
to focus our search on businesses in Asia, we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating
an initial business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our
behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. We intend to effectuate
our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private units, the proceeds
of the sale of our securities in connection with our initial business combination, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, stock and
debt. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception through September 30,
2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the IPO described below and identifying a target company for our
initial Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business
Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the IPO. We
expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing
compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net deficit of 31,278, which consists of loss of 87,519 derived from formation
and operating costs offset by interest earned on investments held in Trust Account of 56,234 and bank interest income of 7. 

For
the period from May 27, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2023, we had a net deficit of 91,197, which consists of loss of
 147,438 derived from formation and operating costs offset by interest earned on investments held in Trust Account of 56,234 and
bank interest income of 7. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

Until the consummation of the
Initial Public Offering, our only source of liquidity was mainly advances of 261,317 from our sponsors, and 25,000 initial
purchase of ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, by the Sponsor, 1,450 issuance of Founder shares to EarlyBirdCapital,
Inc. 

On
September 23, 2024, we consummated our IPO of Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 60,000,000. Simultaneously with
the closing of our IPO, we consummated the sale of 230,000 Private Placement Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit in
a private placement to the Sponsors, generating total gross proceeds of 2,300,000. 

Following the Initial Public Offering and the
private placement, an aggregate of 60,000,000 10.00 per Unit) was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred transaction costs of transaction costs
amounted to 3,722,528 (net of 300,000 underwriters cash reimbursement of deferred offering cost), consisting of 1,200,000 of cash underwriting
fees, 2,100,000 of deferred underwriting fees, and 566,978 of other offering costs. 

For the period from May 27, 2024 (inception)
through September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 258,602. Net loss of 91,197 was affected by interest earned on cash
held in the Trust Account of 56,234. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 111,171 of cash for operating activities. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of
 60,056,234. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up
to 200,000 of interest per year that may be released to us for working capital purposes). We intend to use substantially all of the funds
held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less income taxes payable), to complete
our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our
Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the
target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

17 

As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance
of 575,870 and a working capital surplus of 596,260. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to pay existing
accounts payable, identify and evaluate target business combination candidates, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses,
pay for travel expenditures to plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review
corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination,
and to pay for directors and officers liability insurance premiums. 

In addition, we could use a portion of the funds
not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
or as a down payment with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so.
If we enter into an agreement where we pay for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used
as a down payment would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at
the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds
to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses. 

The management estimates that we may have insufficient
funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance
transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may,
but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required on a non-interest bearing basis. Therefore, there is no guarantee that
the Company may receive such funds as it is up to their sole discretion. In the case that the Company receive such fund support, if the
Company completes its initial Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans. In the event that the initial Business
Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital
Loans but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible
into working capital units at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. Such working capital units would be identical to
the private units sold in the private placement. 

Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern
and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Further, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant
costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. Management plans to address this uncertainty during period leading up to the
Initial Business Combination. The Company cannot provide any assurance that its plans to raise capital or to consummate an Initial Business
Combination will be successful. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company s
board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company. 

Based on the foregoing, management believes that the Company lacks
the financial resources it needs to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time. Moreover, management s plans to consummate
the initial business combination may not be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern.

Other
Contractual Obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating
lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an aggregate of 10,000 per month to the Sponsor or an affiliate
thereof for use of office space, utilities, and administrative support. We have begun incurring these fees on September 19, 2024 and will
continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. 

The
underwriters were entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 2,100,000, payable upon
the closing of an initial business combination. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the
trust account solely in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Registration
Rights 

The
holders of the Founder Shares, EBC founder shares, Private Placement Units will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration
rights agreement dated September 19, 2024 requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. Subject to certain limitations
set forth in such agreement, the holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration
demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights
with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to
register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides
that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until
the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection
with the filing of any such registration statements.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during
the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting estimates
and all the significant accounting policies are described in the Note 2 of this reviewed financial statements. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on our financial statements. 

Item
3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

Item
4 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024.
Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that during the period covered by
this report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were
not effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to
be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

We are not currently required to certify and
report on our internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large
accelerated filer and accelerated filer will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation
requirement. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain
exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including,
but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. 

As on September 30, 2024, we have not completed an assessment, nor
have our auditors tested our systems, of internal controls. We expect to assess the internal controls of our target business or businesses
prior to the completion of our initial business combination and, if necessary, to implement and test additional controls as we may determine
are necessary in order to state that we maintain an effective system of internal controls. A target business may not be in compliance
with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of internal controls. 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting
or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the
SEC for newly public companies. 

19 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

Part
II - Other Information 

Item
2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

underwriting fees, 2,100,000 of deferred underwriting commission and 422,528 (net of 300,000 underwriters cash reimbursement of deferred
