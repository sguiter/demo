SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Hamilton Insurance Group, Inc. ("Quarterly Report") includes "forward looking statements" pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terms such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "target," "should," "could," "would," "seeks," "intends," "plans," "contemplates," "estimates," or "anticipates," or similar expressions which concern our strategy, plans, projections or intentions. These forward-looking statements appear in a number of places throughout and relate to matters such as our industry, growth strategy, goals and expectations concerning our market position, future operations, margins, profitability, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources and other financial and operating information. By their nature, forward-looking statements: speak only as of the date they are made; are not statements of historical fact or guarantees of future performance; and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Our expectations, beliefs, and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management s expectations, beliefs and projections will be achieved and actual results may vary materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements. 
 
 There are a number of risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein. Such risks, uncertainties, and other important factors include, among others, the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth in "Risk Factors" and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Form 10-K and other subsequent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the following: 
 
 our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophic events, global climate change or emerging claim and coverage issues; 
 our business could be materially adversely affected if we do not accurately assess our underwriting risk, our reserves are inadequate to cover our actual losses, our models or assessments and pricing of risks are incorrect or we lose important broker relationships; 
 the insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical and the pricing and terms for our products may decline, which would affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow premiums; 
 we have significant foreign operations that expose us to certain additional risks, including foreign currency risks and political risk; 
 we do not control the allocations to and/or the performance of the Two Sigma Hamilton Fund, LLC ("TS Hamilton Fund") s investment portfolio, and its performance depends on the ability of its investment manager, Two Sigma Investments, LP ("Two Sigma"), to select and manage appropriate investments and we have a limited ability to withdraw our capital accounts; 
 Two Sigma Principals, LLC, Two Sigma and their respective affiliates have potential conflicts of interest that could adversely affect us; 
 the historical performance of Two Sigma is not necessarily indicative of the future results of the TS Hamilton Fund s investment portfolio or of our future results; 
 our ability to manage risks associated with macroeconomic conditions resulting from geopolitical and global economic events, including public health crises, current or anticipated military conflicts, terrorism, sanctions, rising energy prices, inflation and interest rates and other global events; 
 our ability to compete successfully with more established competitors and risks relating to consolidation in the reinsurance and insurance industries; 
 downgrades, potential downgrades or other negative actions by rating agencies; 
 our dependence on key executives, including the potential loss of Bermuda-based personnel as a result of Bermuda employment restrictions, and the inability to attract qualified personnel, particularly in very competitive hiring conditions; 
 our dependence on letter of credit facilities that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms; 
 our potential need for additional capital in the future and the potential unavailability of such capital to us on favorable terms or at all; 
 the suspension or revocation of our subsidiaries insurance licenses; 
 risks associated with our investment strategy, including such risks being greater than those faced by competitors; 
 2 

changes in the regulatory environment and the potential for greater regulatory scrutiny of the Company going forward; 
 a cyclical downturn of the reinsurance industry; 
 operational failures, failure of information systems or failure to protect the confidentiality of customer information, including by service providers, or losses due to defaults, errors or omissions by third parties or our affiliates; 
 we are a holding company with no direct operations, and our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and other distributions to us is restricted by law; 
 risks relating to our ability to identify and execute opportunities for growth or our ability to complete transactions as planned or realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or other investments; 
 our potentially becoming subject to U.S. federal income taxation, Bermuda taxation or other taxes as a result of a change of tax laws or otherwise; 
 the potential characterization of us and/or any of our subsidiaries as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC; 
 our potentially becoming subject to U.S. withholding and information reporting requirements under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, provisions; 
 our costs will increase as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations; 
 if we were to identify a material weakness and were unable to remediate such material weakness, or fail to achieve and maintain effective internal controls, our operating results and financial condition could be impacted and the market price of our Class B common shares may be negatively affected; 
 the lack of a prior public market for our Class B common shares means our share price may be volatile and anti-takeover provisions contained in our organizational documents could delay management changes; 
 the potential that the market price of our Class B common shares could decline due to future sales of shares by our existing shareholders; 
 applicable insurance laws, which could make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company; and 
 investors may have difficulties in serving process or enforcing judgments against us in the United States. 
 
 There may be other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including factors disclosed under the sections entitled "Risk Factors" in the Form 10-K and "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Quarterly Report. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made herein in the context of these risks and uncertainties. 
 
 You should read this information completely and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from expectations. We caution you that the risks, uncertainties, and other factors referenced above may not contain all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results, benefits, or developments that we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our business in the way expected. All forward-looking statements contained herein apply only as of the date hereof and are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

 of the increase in the multiple of the Company's estimated fair market value to GAAP shareholders' equity between the December 1, 2020 VAP inception date and the Company's Initial Public Offering on November 10, 2023. 
 
 As a then nonpublic company, the VAP was initially measured at intrinsic value and no compensation cost was recorded over the period December 1, 2020 to March 31, 2023. On May 15, 2023, the Company became a public business entity and the VAP was remeasured at fair value. The fair value of the compensation cost was estimated at each reporting date and expensed over the period for which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, with any changes recorded in compensation expense by a cumulative catch-up adjustment. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company consummated an IPO of its Class B common shares and, on November 10, 2023, closed its first day of trading. In accordance with the Compensation Committee's decision that the VAP award would be settled in shares if triggered by an IPO, the VAP became subject to equity award accounting. The VAP RSUs vest in two tranches, subject to continued service: on each of the first and second anniversaries of the November 10, 2023 trigger event. Participants who leave prior to vesting forfeit any previously unsettled portion of their awards. 
 
 The Company recorded a compensation expense of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded a compensation expense of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total expense recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, million was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings in "Share compensation expense" in the second quarter of 2023.

 million. This transaction was accounted for as retroactive reinsurance under which cumulative ceded losses exceeding the LPT premium are recognized as a deferred gain liability and amortized into income over the settlement period of the ceded reserves in proportion to cumulative losses collected over the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoverable. The amount of the deferral is recalculated each reporting period based on updated ultimate loss estimates. Consequently, cumulative adverse development subsequent to the signing of the LPT may result in significant losses from operations until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses due under this LPT was million and million, respectively.

 reportable business segments - International and Bermuda. Each of the Company's identified reportable segments has a Chief Executive Officer who is responsible for the overall profitability of their segment and who regularly reports and is directly accountable to the chief operating decision maker: the Chief Executive Officer of the consolidated group.

Overview 
 
 We are a global specialty insurance and reinsurance company founded in Bermuda in 2013, enhanced by data and technology, focused on producing sustainable underwriting profitability and delivering significant shareholder value. We intend to continue growing our diverse book of business by responding to changing market conditions, prudently managing our capital, and driving sustainable shareholder returns. 
 
 We harness multiple drivers to create shareholder value, including diverse underwriting operations supported by proprietary technology and a team of over 550 full-time employees, a strong balance sheet, and a unique investment management relationship with Two Sigma. We operate globally, with underwriting operations in Lloyd s, Ireland, Bermuda, and the United States. 
 
 We operate three principal underwriting platforms (Hamilton Global Specialty, Hamilton Select and Hamilton Re) that are categorized into two reporting business segments (International and Bermuda): 
 
 International: International consists of business written out of our Lloyd s syndicate and subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States, and includes the Hamilton Global Specialty and Hamilton Select platforms. 
 
 Hamilton Global Specialty focuses predominantly on commercial specialty and casualty insurance for medium to large-sized accounts and specialty reinsurance products written by Lloyd s Syndicate 4000 and HIDAC. Syndicate 4000, a leading Lloyd s syndicate, generates a significant portion of premium from the U.S. E S market and has ranked among the most profitable and least volatile syndicates at Lloyd s over the last 10 years. 
 
 Hamilton Select, our recently launched U.S. domestic E S carrier, writes casualty insurance for small to mid-sized clients in the hard-to-place niche of the U.S. E S market. We believe it presents meaningful and profitable growth opportunities in the near to long term, further expanding our footprint in the U.S. E S market. 
 
 Bermuda: Bermuda consists of the Hamilton Re platform, made up of Hamilton Re and Hamilton Re US. Hamilton Re writes property, casualty and specialty reinsurance business on a global basis and also offers high excess Bermuda market specialty insurance products, predominantly for large U.S. commercial risks. Hamilton Re US writes casualty and specialty reinsurance business on a global basis. 
 
 We seek to prudently manage our capital with the objective of effectively navigating different market conditions and generating strong underwriting margins throughout all market cycles. Our scaled and diversified platforms and product offerings and our broad industry relationships provide significant opportunity to underwrite our chosen classes of property, casualty and specialty insurance and reinsurance as market opportunities arise. Leveraging our disciplined underwriting approach, balance sheet strength and flexibility, and real-time technology prowess, we can respond dynamically to capture opportunities as markets evolve. 
 
 One of our key strategic priorities is sustainable underwriting profitability on the business we write. Our data-driven and disciplined underwriting processes position us to intelligently price and structure our products and our business portfolio. We maintain trusted and long-standing relationships with our clients and brokers, who we believe will continue to provide us with increased access to attractive business. 
 
 We see growth opportunities in both the insurance and reinsurance markets in which we operate and intend to pursue disciplined growth across our underwriting platforms. In recent years the E S market has benefited from a strong rate environment and increased submissions as business has shifted into the non-admitted market from the admitted market. Non-admitted insurers are able to cover unique and hard-to-place risks because they have flexibility of rate and form and can accommodate the unique needs of insureds who are unable to obtain coverage from admitted carriers. We believe the access our three underwriting platforms have to U.S. E S insurance business will allow us to build a robust and diversified book of business and achieve our profitable growth objectives throughout various market cycles. 

36 

Reinsurance business offers a particularly attractive opportunity given the favorable rating environment and discipline in the market and is expected to accelerate growth opportunities for us in the near term in many areas. A number of factors, including economic and social inflation and continued high interest rates are driving the most favorable market conditions seen in decades. We are a recognized market with deep client and broker relationships and have low counter-party credit concentration with many of our insurance partners, providing ample headroom for us to grow. We are well positioned to deploy capital quickly, efficiently and profitably through writing more reinsurance business, as well as retaining more of our own business. 
 
 Our strong, sustainable underwriting operations are complemented by our unique investment portfolio, which consists of the Two Sigma Hamilton Fund ("TS Hamilton Fund" or "TSHF"), and our investment grade fixed income portfolio, which is currently benefiting from strong interest rates. We plan to continue to optimize our investment portfolio through a balanced allocation of invested assets and maintain the flexibility to adjust this allocation as needed. We believe our strategy of disciplined underwriting growth, balanced with our investment platform, will drive our ability to create shareholder value. 
 
 We have a unique and long-term investment management relationship with Two Sigma. Founded in 2001, Two Sigma is a premier investment manager with a strong track record, driven by a differentiated application of technology and data science. The TS Hamilton Fund is a dedicated fund-of-one managed by Two Sigma with exposures to certain Two Sigma macro and equity strategies and is designed to provide low-correlated absolute returns, primarily by combining multiple hedged and leveraged systematic investment strategies with proprietary risk management investment optimization and execution techniques. The TS Hamilton Fund invests in a broad set of financial instruments and is primarily focused on liquid strategies in global equity, FX markets, exchange-listed and over the counter options (and their underlying instruments) and other derivatives. This liquidity profile fits well with our business, while also providing the benefit of access to a dedicated fund-of-one. 
 
 Two Sigma has broad discretion to allocate invested assets to different opportunities. Its current investments include Two Sigma Futures Portfolio, LLC ("FTV"), Two Sigma Spectrum Portfolio, LLC ("STV") and Two Sigma Equity Spectrum Portfolio, LLC ("ESTV"). The TS Hamilton Fund s trading and investment activities are not limited to these strategies and techniques and the TS Hamilton Fund is permitted to pursue any investment strategy and/or technique that Two Sigma determines in its sole discretion to be appropriate for the TS Hamilton Fund from time to time. 

Effects of Inflation 
 
 Historically, inflation has not had a material effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations. However, global economic inflation has recently increased and there is a risk that it will remain elevated for an extended period. Inflation is subject to many macroeconomic factors beyond our control, including global banking policy, political risks, and supply chain issues. An inflationary economy may result in higher losses and loss adjustment expenses, negatively impact the performance of our fixed income security investment portfolio, or increase our operating expenses, among other unfavorable effects. The ultimate effects of an inflationary or deflationary period are subject to high uncertainty and cannot be accurately estimated until the actual costs are known. 
 
 In the wake of a catastrophe loss there is a risk of specific inflationary pressures in the local economy, which is considered in our catastrophe loss models. Similarly, the Company incorporates the anticipated effects of inflation in our ultimate estimate of the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses on certain long-tail lines of business. As with general economic inflation, the actual effects of inflation on reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and results of operations cannot be accurately known until all of the underlying claims are ultimately settled. 

Taxes 
 
 On December 27, 2023, the Bermuda Government enacted a 15 corporate income tax that will generally become effective for Bermuda domiciled entities on or after January 1, 2025. The legislation defers the effective date until January 1, 2030 for so long as the consolidated group operates in six or fewer jurisdictions, has less than 50 million in tangible assets and none of its Bermuda entities are subject to the Income Inclusion Rule in any other jurisdiction. The act is a response to the OECD Pillar 2 worldwide minimum tax that would otherwise require a top-up tax be paid on Bermuda-sourced income to non-Bermuda jurisdictions such that a 15 minimum effective tax rate is achieved for Hamilton Group s Bermuda entities. Hamilton Group expects to be exempt from the worldwide minimum tax until January 1, 2030, pursuant to an exemption similar to that available in Bermuda. The act includes a provision referred to as the economic transition adjustment, which is intended to provide a fair and equitable transition into the tax regime, and, as a result, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of 35.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023.

Operating Highlights 
 
 The following significant items impacted the consolidated results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Gross premiums written Gross premiums written were 553.4 million and 474.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in gross premiums written was primarily driven by our casualty, specialty and property reinsurance and property insurance classes. The increase was a result of new business, increased participations on existing business and a strong rate environment across multiple classes of business. 
 
 Underwriting results The combined ratio was 93.6 and 92.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the catastrophe loss ratio, partially offset by a decrease in the other underwriting expense ratio, attritional loss ratio and acquisition cost ratio.

Segment Information 
 
 We have determined our reportable business segments based on the information used by management in assessing performance and allocating resources to underwriting operations. We have identified two reportable business segments - International and Bermuda. Each of our identified reportable segments has a Chief Executive Officer who is responsible for the overall profitability of their segment and who regularly reports and is directly accountable to the chief operating decision maker: the Chief Executive Officer of the consolidated group. 
 
 We evaluate the performance of reportable segments based on their respective underwriting income or loss. Underwriting income or loss is calculated as net premiums earned less losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs, and other underwriting expenses (net of third party fee income). General and administrative expenses not incurred by the reportable segments are included in corporate and other expenses as part of the reconciliation of net underwriting income or loss to net income or loss attributable to common shareholders. As we do not manage our assets by reportable segment, investment income and assets are not allocated to reportable segments. 
 
 Our core business is underwriting and our underwriting results are reflected in our reportable segments: (1) International, which is comprised of property, casualty and specialty insurance and reinsurance classes of business originating from the Company s London, Dublin, and Hamilton Select operations; and (2) Bermuda, which is comprised of property, casualty and specialty insurance and reinsurance classes of business originating from Hamilton Re, Bermuda and Hamilton Re US and subsidiaries. We consider many factors, including the nature of each segment s products, client types, production sources, distribution methods and the regulatory environment, in determining the aggregated operating segments. 
 
 Corporate includes net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net investment income (loss), other income (loss) not incurred by the reportable segments, net foreign exchange gains (losses), general and administrative expenses not incurred by the reportable segments, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, and income tax expense (benefit).

Key Operating and Financial Metrics 
 
 The Company has identified the following metrics as key measures of the Company s performance: 

Book Value per Common Share 
 
 Management believes that book value is an important indicator of value provided to common shareholders and aligns the Company s and most investors long term objectives. We calculate book value per common share as total common shareholders equity divided by the total number of common shares outstanding at the point in time. 
 
 As at in thousands, except per share amounts) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Closing common shareholders' equity 2,313,626 2,047,850 Closing common shares outstanding 101,392,722 110,225,103 Book value per common share 22.82 18.58 
 
 Book value per common share was 22.82 at September 30, 2024, a 4.24 or 22.8 increase from the Company s book value per common share of 18.58 at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the Company s net income attributable to common shareholders of 366.5 million and the accretive impact of share repurchases (see Note 11, Share Capital in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements for further details). 

Tangible Book Value per Common Share 
 
 Management believes that tangible book value is an important indicator of value provided to common shareholders and aligns the Company s and most investors long term objectives. We calculate tangible book value per common share as total common shareholders equity less intangible assets, divided by the total number of common shares outstanding at the point in time. 
 
 As at in thousands, except per share amounts) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Closing common shareholders' equity 2,313,626 2,047,850 Intangible assets 94,441 90,996 Closing common shareholders' equity, less intangible assets 2,219,185 1,956,854 Closing common shares outstanding 101,392,722 110,225,103 Tangible book value per common share 
 21.89 17.75 
 
 Tangible book value per common share was 21.89 at September 30, 2024, a 4.14 or 23.3 increase from the Company s tangible book value per common share o f 17.75 at December 31, 2023 . The increase was primarily driven by the Company s net income attributable to common shareholders of 366.5 million and the accretive impact of share repurchases (see Note 11, Share Capital in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements for further details). 

70 

Return on Average Common Shareholders' Equity 
 
 Management believes that return on average common shareholders equity or ("ROACE") is an important indicator of the Company s profitability and financial efficiency. We calculate it by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by average common shareholders' equity for the corresponding period. 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders 78,250 43,583 366,509 131,862 Average common shareholders' equity for the period 2,276,087 1,775,940 2,180,739 1,731,954 Return on average common shareholders' equity 3.4 2.5 16.8 7.6 
 
 ROACE was 3.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the higher net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 ROACE was 16.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the higher net income attributable to common shareholders reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 We present our results of operations in a way that we believe will be the most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use our financial information to evaluate our performance. Some of the measurements are considered non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules and regulations. In this Form 10-Q, we present underwriting income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Item 10(e) of SEC Regulation S-K. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, which may be defined and calculated differently by other companies, help explain and enhance the understanding of our results of operations. However, these measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Where appropriate, reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included below. 
 
 Underwriting Income (Loss) 
 
 We calculate underwriting income (loss) on a pre-tax basis as net premiums earned less losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses (net of third party fee income). We believe that this measure of our performance focuses on the core fundamental performance of the Company s reportable segments in any given period and is not distorted by investment market conditions, corporate expense allocations or income tax effects. 
 
 The table below reconciles underwriting income (loss) to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Underwriting income (loss) 29,094 24,866 126,920 93,823 Total net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments and net investment income (loss) 65,558 55,412 498,518 119,600 Other income (loss), excluding third party fee income 85 85 Net foreign exchange gains (losses) (5,973) 1,432 (9,883) (3,953) Corporate expenses (14,060) (18,678) (41,825) (31,833) Amortization of intangible assets (5,204) (2,794) (11,773) (7,869) Interest expense (5,351) (5,288) (17,090) (16,007) Income tax (expense) benefit (3,029) (2,387) (6,118) (6,908) Net income (loss), prior to non-controlling interest 61,035 52,648 538,749 146,938 
 
 Third Party Fee Income 
 
 Third party fee income includes income that is incremental and/or directly attributable to our underwriting operations. It is primarily comprised of fees earned by the International segment for management services provided to third party syndicates and consortia and by the Bermuda segment for performance based management fees generated by our third party capital manager, Ada Capital Management Limited. We believe that this measure is a relevant component of our underwriting income (loss). 
 
 The table below reconciles third party fee income to other income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Third party fee income 4,464 2,301 17,934 7,753 Other income (loss), excluding third party fee income 85 85 Other income (loss) 4,464 2,386 17,934 7,838 

72 

Other Underwriting Expenses 
 
 Other underwriting expenses include those general and administrative expenses that are incremental and/or directly attributable to our underwriting operations. While this measure is presented in Note 9, Segment Reporting , it is considered a non-GAAP financial measure when presented elsewhere. 
 
 Corporate expenses include holding company costs necessary to support our reportable segments. As these costs are not incremental and/or directly attributable to our underwriting operations, these costs are excluded from other underwriting expenses, and therefore, underwriting income (loss). General and administrative expenses, the most comparable GAAP financial measure to other underwriting expenses, also includes corporate expenses. 
 
 The table below reconciles other underwriting expenses to general and administrative expenses, the most comparable GAAP financial measure: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Other underwriting expenses 48,332 44,357 140,339 126,242 Corporate expenses 14,060 18,678 41,825 31,833 General and administrative expenses 62,392 63,035 182,164 158,075 
 
 Other Underwriting Expense Ratio 
 
 Other Underwriting Expense Ratio is a measure of the other underwriting expenses (net of third party fee income) incurred by the Company and is expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned. 
 
 Loss Ratio 
 
 Attritional Loss Ratio current year is the attritional losses incurred by the company relating to the current year divided by net premiums earned. 
 
 Attritional Loss Ratio prior year development is the attritional losses incurred by the company relating to prior years divided by net premiums earned. 
 
 Catastrophe Loss Ratio current year is the catastrophe losses incurred by the company relating to the current year divided by net premiums earned. 
 
 Catastrophe Loss Ratio prior year development is the catastrophe losses incurred by the company relating to prior years divided by net premiums earned. 
 
 Combined Ratio 
 
 Combined Ratio is a measure of our underwriting profitability and is expressed as the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, acquisition cost ratio and other underwriting expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100 indicates an underwriting profit, while a combined ratio over 100 indicates an underwriting loss.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Financial Condition 
 
 Investment Philosophy 
 
 The Company maintains two segregated investment portfolios: a fixed maturities and short-term investments trading portfolio and an investment in Two Sigma Hamilton Fund ("TS Hamilton Fund"). 
 
 The Company's high quality and liquid fixed maturities and short-term investments portfolio is structured to focus primarily on the preservation of capital and the availability of liquidity to meet the Company s claims obligations, to be well diversified across market sectors, and to generate relatively attractive returns on a risk-adjusted basis over time. The Company s investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities.

 Total cash and investments increased from 4.0 billion at December 31, 2023 to 4.8 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by positive returns for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on both the TS Hamilton Fund and fixed maturity investments. Fixed maturity investments also increased with the deployment of more cash into the fixed maturity trading portfolio to take advantage of higher U.S. treasury interest rates. The TS Hamilton Fund represents 2.0 billion and 1.8 billion of the total cash and investments as at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

TS Hamilton Fund 
 
 Although Two Sigma has broad discretion to allocate invested assets to different opportunities, the current strategy is focused on highly diversified liquid positions in global equities, futures and foreign exchange markets. Through its investments in Two Sigma Futures Portfolio, LLC ("FTV"), Two Sigma Spectrum Portfolio, LLC ("STV") and Two Sigma Equity Spectrum Portfolio, LLC ("ESTV"), we seek to achieve absolute dollar denominated returns on a substantial capital base primarily by combining multiple hedged and leveraged systematic investment strategies with proprietary risk management and execution techniques. These systematic strategies include, but are not limited to, technical and statistically-based, fundamental-based, event-based, market condition-based and spread-based strategies as well as contributor-based and/or sentiment-based strategies and blended strategies. FTV primarily utilizes systematic strategies to gain broad macro exposure to FX, fixed income, equity and credit indices, and commodities, predominantly by trading futures, spots, forwards, options, swaps, cash bonds and exchange traded products. STV primarily utilizes systematic strategies to trade U.S.-listed equity securities and related instruments and derivatives. ESTV primarily utilizes systematic strategies to trade non-U.S.-listed equity securities and related instruments and derivatives. At September 30, 2024, the Company owns an 18.5 , 17.9 and 9.8 interest in each of the FTV, STV and ESTV funds, respectively. 
 
 TS Hamilton Fund invests in Two Sigma Funds ("Two Sigma Funds"), which are stated at their estimated fair values, which generally represent the Company s proportionate interest in the members equity of the Two Sigma Funds as reported by the respective funds based on the net asset value ("NAV") provided by the fund administrator. The Company accounts for its investment in Two Sigma Funds under the variable interest model at NAV as a practical expedient for fair value in the consolidated balance sheets.

 The increase in the total fair value of the Company s investments in Two Sigma Funds from 851.5 million at December 31, 2023 to 932.8 million at September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by investment gains and collateral management within TS Hamilton Fund. The total net assets managed in TS Hamilton Fund represent our investment in and exposure to Two Sigma Funds investment strategies. However, as part of Two Sigma s collateral management processes, any capital not required to be held within one of the specific trading vehicles is held in cash or short-term investments within TS Hamilton Fund as shown in the following table. The cash and short-term investment balances are not managed by the Company, nor can they be removed from TS Hamilton Fund as they support the underlying investment strategies within the three trading vehicles.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet the short-term and long-term cash requirements of its business operations. The Company manages liquidity at the holding company and operating subsidiary level. 
 
 Management believes that its significant cash flows from operations and high quality liquid investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were 1.0 billion and 794.5 million, respectively, and total restricted cash and cash equivalents were 93.9 million and 106.4 million, respectively. 
 
 Holding Company 
 
 As a holding company, Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. has no operations of its own and its assets consist primarily of investments in its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. s future cash flows depend on the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions, such as returns of capital, from its subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends and/or distributions is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the various countries and states in which the Company s subsidiaries operate (refer to Note 18, Statutory Requirements in the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further details), as well as the need to maintain capital levels to adequately support insurance and reinsurance operations, and to preserve financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. 

78 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. received 157.5 million and 44.0 million, respectively, of distributions from its subsidiaries. Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. s primary use of funds is interest payments on debt and credit facilities, common share repurchases, capital investments in subsidiaries, and payment of corporate operating expenses. Common share repurchases may be conducted through open market repurchases and/or privately negotiated transactions. See Note 11, Share Capital, in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements for further detail of common share repurchases in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Management believes the dividend distribution capacity of Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. s subsidiaries, which was estimated at 471.6 million at December 31, 2023, will provide Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. with sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Operating Subsidiaries 
 
 Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. s operating subsidiaries primarily derive cash from the net inflow of premiums less claim payments related to underwriting activities and from net investment income. Historically, these cash receipts have been sufficient to fund the operating expenses of these subsidiaries, as well as to fund dividend payments to Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. The subsidiaries remaining cash flows are generally invested into the investment portfolio. The remaining cash flows have also been used to fund common share repurchases and to fund acquisitions. 
 
 The operating subsidiaries insurance and reinsurance business inherently provides liquidity, as premiums are received in advance (sometimes substantially in advance) of the time losses are paid. However, the amount of cash required to fund loss payments can fluctuate significantly from period to period, due to the low frequency and high severity nature of certain types of business written. As such, cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly between periods. 
 
 The payment of dividends by operating subsidiaries is, under certain circumstances, limited by the applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries operate. In addition, insurance laws require the insurance subsidiaries to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity. Management believes that each of the Company s insurance subsidiaries and branches exceeded the minimum solvency, capital and surplus requirements in their applicable jurisdictions at December 31, 2023. Certain of the subsidiaries and branches are required to file Financial Condition Reports ("FCR"), with their regulators, which provide details on solvency and financial performance. Where required, these FCRs are posted on the Company s website. 
 
 The regulations governing the Company s principal operating subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and to maintain certain measures of solvency and liquidity are discussed in Note 18, Statutory Requirements in the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Consolidated Cash Flows 
 
 Consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows: 
 
 For the Nine Months Ended in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 475,213 247,669 Investing activities (95,276) (530,939) Financing activities (235,310) (17,313) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 5,768 (3,093) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 150,395 (303,676) 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was 475.2 million and 247.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash inflows from insurance and reinsurance operations typically include premiums, net of acquisition costs, and reinsurance recoverables. Cash outflows principally include payments of losses and loss expenses, payments of premiums to reinsurers and operating expenses. Cash provided by operating activities fluctuates due to timing differences between the collection of premiums and reinsurance recoverables and the payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and the payment of premiums to reinsurers. 

79 

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was (95.3) million and (530.9) million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily driven by the timing of investing activities and the net proceeds of turnover in our fixed maturities and short-term investments. 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was (235.3) million and (17.3) million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by share repurchases (see Note 11, Share Capital in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements for further details) and incentive allocations paid to TS Hamilton Fund. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by incentive allocations paid to TS Hamilton Fund. 
 
 The Company believes that annual positive cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to cover claims payments, absent a series of additional large catastrophic losses. However, should claim payment obligations accelerate beyond the Company s ability to fund payments from operating cash flows, the Company would utilize cash and cash equivalent balances and/or liquidate a portion of the Company s fixed maturities and short term investments trading portfolio and/or access certain credit facilities. The Company s fixed maturities and short term investments trading portfolio is heavily weighted towards conservative, high quality and highly liquid securities. 
 
 In addition, if necessary, the Company generally has two options related to liquidating a portion of the investment portfolio in the TS Hamilton Fund, subject to Hamilton Re s minimum investment commitment, which are as follows: 
 
 Monthly liquidity - Subject to certain conditions, Hamilton Re may request a whole or partial withdrawal of its capital account, no later than fifteen days prior to the end of a calendar month, effective as of the last day of such calendar month. 
 
 Daily liquidity - Subject to certain limited circumstances, including the need to meet obligations pursuant to Hamilton Re s underwriting operations, Hamilton Re may request a withdrawal of all or a portion of its capital account upon at least one business day s written notice of such withdrawal request date to the Managing Member. Claim payments pertaining to any such large catastrophic event would be paid out over a period spanning many months. 
 
 Management expects that, if necessary, the full value of cash, fixed income and short-term investments at September 30, 2024 could be available in one to three business days under normal market conditions, except for 465.8 million of restricted cash and investments which primarily support the Company s obligations in regulatory jurisdictions where it operates as a non-admitted carrier (refer to Note 3, Investments in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements) and 264.0 million of restricted cash and investments which primarily support the Company s letter of credit facilities (refer to Note 10, Debt and Credit Facilities in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated f inancial statements). 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Management monitors the Company s capital adequacy on a regular basis and seeks to adjust its capital according to the needs of the business. In particular, the Company requires capital sufficient to meet or exceed the capital adequacy ratios established by rating agencies for maintenance of appropriate financial strength ratings and the capital adequacy tests performed by regulatory authorities. From time to time, rating agencies and regulatory authorities may make changes in their models and methodologies, which could increase the amount of capital the Company requires. The Company may seek to raise additional capital or return capital to shareholders through some combination of common share repurchases and cash dividends. In the normal course of operations, management may from time to time evaluate additional share or debt issuances given prevailing market conditions and capital management strategies. In addition, the Company enters into agreements with financial institutions to obtain letter of credit facilities for the benefit of its operating subsidiaries to support their business operations. Management believes that the Company holds sufficient capital to allow it to take advantage of market opportunities and to maintain its financial strength ratings and comply with various local statutory regulations.

The following table summarizes our consolidated total capital: 
 
 As at in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Shareholders' equity 2,313,626 2,047,850 
 
 The Company s total capital was 2.3 billion at September 30, 2024, a 13.0 increase compared to 2.0 billion at 
 December 31, 2023. The primary driver of the increase in total capital was the Company s net income attributable to common shareholders of 366.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by share repurchases (see Note 11, Share Capital in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements for further details). 
 
 Debt 
 
 On June 23, 2022, the Company renewed its unsecured 150 million term loan credit arrangement, as amended from time to time (the "Facility"), with various lenders as arranged by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. All or a portion of the loan issued under the Facility bears interest at either (a) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (b) the Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus the Applicable Margin, at the Company's discretion. In the event of default, an additional 2 interest in excess of (a) or (b) will be levied, not to exceed the highest rate permissible under applicable law, and certain types of loans may not be available for borrowing by the Company under the Facility. The Facility matures on June 23, 2025, unless accelerated pursuant to the terms of the Facility, and it contains usual and customary representations, warranties, conditions and covenants for bank loan facilities of this type. The Facility also contains certain financial covenants which cap the ratio of consolidated debt to capital and require that the Company maintain a certain minimum consolidated net worth. The net worth requirement is recalculated effective as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As at September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants .

In addition, the Board of Directors may limit a shareholder s voting rights when it deems it appropriate to do so to avoid certain material adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences to the Company or any direct or indirect shareholder or its affiliates. 
 
 On September 13, 2024, 1.7 million Class A common shares were converted into Class C common shares at the request of the Class A Members and as approved by the Board.

Credit Facilities 
 
 The Company has several available letter of credit facilities and a revolving loan facility provided by commercial banks. The letter of credit facilities are utilized to provide collateral to reinsureds of Hamilton Re and its affiliates to the extent required under insurance and reinsurance agreements and to support capital requirements at Lloyd s. 
 
 On December 5, 2018 and December 27, 2018, Hamilton Re Ltd entered into a Master Agreement for Issuance of Payment Instruments and a Facility Letter for Issuance of Payment Instruments respectively, with CitiBank Europe Plc ("CitiBank Europe"), under which CitiBank Europe agreed to provide an uncommitted secured letter of credit facility for the issuance of standby letters of credit or similar instruments in multiple currencies. On August 8, 2023, letter of credit capacity under this facility was increased to 200 million. At all times during which it is a party to the facility, Hamilton Re is obligated to pledge to CitiBank Europe cash and/or securities with a value that equals or exceeds the aggregate face amount of its then-outstanding letters of credit. The Master Agreement contains events of default customary for facilities of this type. In the facility letter, Hamilton Re makes representations and warranties that are customary for facilities of this type and agrees that it will comply with certain informational and other undertakings. 
 
 On June 23, 2022, the Company and Hamilton Re amended and restated their unsecured credit agreement with a syndication of lenders (the "Unsecured Facility"). Under the Unsecured Facility, the lenders have agreed to provide up to an aggregate of 415 million of letter of credit capacity for Hamilton Re, up to 150 million of which may be utilized for revolving loans to be issued to the Company. At September 30, 2024, there were no loan amounts outstanding under this facility. Margin rates reflect contractually agreed rates, which are based on Hamilton Re s current Financial Strength Rating as assigned by A.M. Best. As of April 30, 2024, letters of credit issued under the facility bear interest at a rate of 137.5 basis points (previously 150 basis points), while revolving loans if issued are subject to a fee of SOFR plus a margin of 162.5 basis points (previously 185 basis points). To the extent such loans are issued, the available letter of credit capacity shall decrease proportionally, such that the aggregate credit exposure for the lenders under the credit agreement is 415 million. Amounts unutilized under the facility are subject to a fee of 17.5 basis points (previously 22.5 basis points). Capacity is provided by Wells Fargo, National Association, Truist Bank, BMO Harris Bank N.A., Commerzbank AG, New York Branch, HSBC Bank USA, N.A., and Barclays Bank PLC. Unless renewed or otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms, the Unsecured Facility is scheduled to terminate on June 23, 2025. 
 
 On August 12, 2024, Hamilton Re and HIDAC amended their committed letter of credit facility agreement with Bank of Montreal ("BMO"), with the Company as guarantor, under which BMO agreed to make available a secured letter of credit facility of 50 million for a term that will expire on August 13, 2025. The facility bears a fee of 40 basis points for letters of credit issued and 15 basis points on any unutilized portion of the facility. 
 
 Effective October 25, 2024, Hamilton Re amended its letter of credit facility agreement with UBS AG ("UBS") under which UBS and certain of its affiliates agreed to make available to Hamilton Re a secured letter of credit facility of 100 million for a term that will expire on October 25, 2025. The facility bears a fee of 140 basis points on the total available capacity. 
 
 In addition, on October 28, 2024, Hamilton Re amended the unsecured letter of credit facility agreement that it utilizes to provide Funds at Lloyd's ("FAL") ("FAL LOC Facility") to support the FAL requirements of Syndicate 4000. Capacity is provided by Barclays Bank PLC, ING Bank N.V., London Branch, and Bank of Montreal, London Branch. The FAL LOC Facility of 230 million was renewed for an additional one year term that expires on October 28, 2025. The facility bears a fee of 162.5 basis points on the borrowed amount.

Financial Strength Ratings 
 
 The Company s principal insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries are assigned financial strength ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies A.M. Best, Fitch Ratings and Kroll Bond Rating Agency. These ratings are publicly announced and are available directly from the agencies' websites. 
 
 Financial strength ratings represent the independent opinions of the rating agencies as to the relative creditworthiness of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of its insurance and reinsurance contracts. Independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish a competitive position in insurance and reinsurance markets. These ratings are based on factors considered by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders, agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. 
 
 On April 30, 2024, A.M. Best, a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO"), upgraded the Financial Strength Rating to "A" (Excellent) from "A-" (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings ("ICR") of "a" (Excellent) from "a-" (Excellent) of Hamilton Re and HIDAC, each a wholly owned subsidiary of Hamilton. Also, the outlook on these ratings was revised to "stable" from "positive". 
 
 On July 2, 2024, Fitch Ratings Fitch ), an NRSRO, published Hamilton Re s Issuer Financial Strength Rating of "A-" (Strong) and Hamilton Insurance Group s Issuer Default Rating of "BBB+". The rating outlook is "stable". 
 
 On July 23, 2024, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, an NRSRO, affirmed the insurance financial strength rating of "A" of Hamilton Re and the "BBB+" issuer rating of Hamilton Insurance Group. The outlook on these ratings was changed to "stable" from "positive", also on July 23, 2024. 
 
 On August 7, 2024, A.M. Best increased its financial strength rating of the Lloyd's market from "A" to "A+" with a stable outlook, and on December 13, 2023, S P Global, an NRSRO, increased its financial strength rating of the Lloyd's market from "A+" to "AA-" with a stable outlook. Our Lloyd s syndicate benefits from financial strength ratings of A (Excellent) from A.M. Best and AA- from each of S P Global, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or KBRA and Fitch Ratings Inc. ("Fitch"). 

Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 
 Reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
 
 The Company establishes loss reserves using actuarial models, historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to estimate its ultimate liability of all losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the contracts at a given point in time. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability. Estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events and the eventual actual outcome of these events may be substantially different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates. The Company believes that the recorded reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents management s best estimate of the cost to settle the ultimate liabilities based on information available at September 30, 2024. 

84 

See Note 9, Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses to the audited consolidated financial statements as included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the reconciliation of the gross and net reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses and for a discussion of prior year reserve development. 
 
 Paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable 
 
 In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claim events by reinsuring certain levels of risk with other reinsurers. See Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Ceded reinsurance and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a detailed discussion of the Company s risks related to ceded reinsurance agreements and the Company s process to evaluate the financial condition of its reinsurers.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are principally exposed to four types of market risk: interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency risk. Our investment guidelines permit, subject to approval, investments in derivative instruments such as futures, options, foreign currency forward contracts and swap agreements, which may be used to assume risks or for hedging purposes.
