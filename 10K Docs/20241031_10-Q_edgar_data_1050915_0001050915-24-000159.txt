As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Quanta had recognized revenues of million and million related to unapproved change orders and claims included as contract price adjustments primarily in Contract assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These change orders and claims were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business and represent management s estimates of additional contract revenues that have been earned and are probable of collection. 
 The largest component of the revenues recognized related to unapproved change orders and claims as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is associated with a large renewable transmission project in Canada. During 2021 and 2022, decreased productivity and additional costs arose from delays, administrative requirements and labor issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental governmental requirements and worksite restrictions. During 2023, additional costs arose from residual impacts associated with the aforementioned items, as well as work resequencing and acceleration, access delays, and logistical challenges and other issues outside of Quanta s control. As of March 31, 2024, the project was substantially completed. 
 
 Revenues were positively impacted by during both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as a result of changes in estimates associated with performance obligations on fixed price contracts partially satisfied prior to June 30, 2024 and 2023. Revenues were positively impacted by during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as a result of changes in estimates associated with performance obligations on fixed price contracts partially satisfied prior to December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 Operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were impacted by less than of gross profit as a result of aggregate changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress as of June 30, 2024. 
 Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were impacted by less than of gross profit as a result of aggregate changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress as of December 31, 2023. However, gross profit was negatively impacted by million as a result of increased costs related to a large solar facility project in the United States and by million as a result of decreased productivity associated with a large solar facility project in the United States (substantially incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2024). 
 Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were impacted by less than of gross profit as a result of aggregate changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Contract liabilities 
 Contract assets and liabilities fluctuate period to period based on various factors, including, among others, changes in the number and size of projects in progress at period end; variability in billing and payment terms, such as up-front or advance billings, interim or milestone billings, or deferred billings; and recognized unapproved change orders and contract claims. The decrease in contract assets from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the completion of certain large projects and the corresponding billing of amounts previously recorded as contract assets, while the increase in contract liabilities was primarily due to recent acquisitions. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Quanta recognized revenue of approximately billion and million related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the end of each respective prior year. 
 Accounts Receivable, Allowance for Credit Losses and Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 risk pools for the purpose of calculating its historical credit loss experience. 
 Quanta s historical loss ratio and its determination of risk pools, which are used to calculate expected credit losses, may be adjusted for changes in customer credit concentrations within its portfolio of financial assets, changes in customers ability to pay, and other considerations, such as economic and market changes, changes to regulatory or technological environments affecting customers and the consistency between current and forecasted economic conditions and the historical economic conditions used to derive historical loss ratios. At the end of each quarter, management reassesses these and other relevant factors, including the impact of uncertainty and challenges in the overall economy and in Quanta s industries and markets, (e.g., inflationary pressure, supply chain and other logistical challenges and increased interest rates). 
 Additional allowance for credit losses is established for financial asset balances with specific customers where collectability has been determined to be improbable based on customer specific facts and circumstances. Quanta considers accounts receivable delinquent after 30 days but, absent certain specific considerations, generally does not consider such amounts delinquent in its credit loss analysis unless the accounts receivable are at least 120 days outstanding. In addition, management monitors the credit quality of its receivables by, among other things, obtaining credit ratings for significant customers, assessing economic and market conditions and evaluating material changes to a customer s business, cash flows and financial condition. Should anticipated recoveries relating to receivables fail to materialize, including anticipated recoveries relating to bankruptcies or other workout situations, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided. 
 Accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance for credit losses if they are deemed uncollectible.

The amendment also (i) increased the limit on surety-backed letters of credit issued separate from the senior credit facility to million at any one time outstanding and (ii) increased the cross-default threshold for other debt instruments to those exceeding million in borrowings or availability. Additionally, on June 10, 2024, the senior credit facility was amended to establish Term CORRA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) as the benchmark rate for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, in replacement of the CDOR Rate (as defined therein prior to giving effect to the amendment).

The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. In all instances, management has assessed the matter based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, giving due consideration to the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought and the probability of success and taking into account, among other things, negotiations with claimants, discovery, settlements and payments, judicial rulings, arbitration and mediation decisions, advice of internal and external legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. . Except as otherwise stated below, none of these proceedings are expected to have a material adverse effect on Quanta s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, management s judgment may prove materially inaccurate, and such judgment is made subject to the known uncertainties of litigation.

separate contracts with an agency of the Peruvian Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MTC), currently Programa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (PRONATEL), as successor to Fondo de Inversion en Telecomunicaciones (FITEL), pursuant to which Redes would design, construct and operate certain telecommunication networks in rural regions of Peru. The aggregate consideration provided for in the contracts was approximately million, consisting of approximately million to be paid during the construction period and approximately million to be paid during a post-construction operation and maintenance period. At the beginning of the project, FITEL made advance payments totaling approximately million to Redes, which were secured by two on-demand advance payment bonds posted by Redes to guarantee proper use of the payments in the execution of the project. Redes also provided two on-demand performance bonds in the aggregate amount of million to secure performance of its obligations under the contracts. 
 During the construction phase, the project experienced numerous challenges and delays, primarily related to issues which Quanta believes were outside of the control of and not attributable to Redes, including, among others, weather-related issues, local opposition to the project, permitting delays, the inability to acquire clear title to certain required parcels of land and other delays which Quanta believes were attributable to FITEL/PRONATEL. In response to various of these challenges and delays, Redes requested and received multiple extensions to certain contractual deadlines and relief from related liquidated damages. However, in April 2019, PRONATEL provided notice to Redes claiming that Redes was in default under the contracts due to the delays and that PRONATEL would terminate the contracts if the alleged defaults were not cured. Redes responded by claiming that it was not in default, as the delays were due to events not attributable to Redes, and therefore PRONATEL was not entitled to terminate the contracts. PRONATEL subsequently terminated the contracts for alleged cause prior to completion of Redes scope of work, exercised the on-demand performance bonds and advance payment bonds against Redes, and indicated its intention to claim damages, including liquidated damages under the contracts. As of the date of the contract terminations, Redes had incurred costs of approximately million related to the design and construction of the project and had received approximately million of payments (inclusive of the approximately million advance payments). 
 In May 2019, Redes filed for arbitration before the Court of International Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against PRONATEL and the MTC. In the arbitration, Redes claimed that PRONATEL: breached and wrongfully terminated the contracts; wrongfully executed the advance payment bonds and the performance bonds; and was not entitled to the alleged amount of liquidated damages. In August 2022, Redes received the decision of the arbitration tribunal, which unanimously found in favor of Redes in connection with its claims and ordered, among other things, (i) repayment of the amounts collected by PRONATEL under the advance payment bonds and the performance bonds; (ii) payment of amounts owed for work completed by Redes under the contracts; (iii) payment of lost income in connection with Redes future operation and maintenance of the networks; and (iv) payment of other related costs and damages to Redes as a result of the breach and improper termination of the contracts (including costs related to the execution of the bonds, costs related to the transfer of the networks and legal and expert fees). Accordingly, the arbitration tribunal awarded Redes approximately million. In addition, per the terms of the arbitration decision, interest will accrue on any amount owed pursuant to this award up to the date of payment. 
 The decision of the arbitration tribunal is final, with limited grounds on which PRONATEL and the MTC may seek to annul the decision in Peruvian courts. In December 2022, Redes filed an enforcement proceeding with respect to each project contract to secure recovery of the arbitration award, and PRONATEL and the MTC filed an annulment proceeding with respect to each project contract. The enforcement and annulment proceedings were filed with different commercial courts in Lima, Peru. During 2023 and 2024, Redes received favorable rulings in each of the enforcement proceedings and each of the annulment proceedings, and the grounds for annulment were rejected; however, PRONATEL and the MTC are pursuing, and are expected to continue to pursue, certain remaining legal challenges to such rulings. We expect these remaining legal challenges will be resolved in 2025 or 2026. 
 In December 2022 and January 2023, following the favorable arbitration ruling, Quanta received million pursuant to coverage under insurance policies for the improper collection by PRONATEL and the MTC of the advance payment and performance bonds and for nonpayment by PRONATEL and the MTC of amounts owed for work completed by Redes. Additionally, while PRONATEL and the MTC are continuing to pursue their remaining legal challenges, in October 2024, in compliance with the ICC arbitration award, Quanta received approximately million, previously held in escrow by a Peruvian bank, in connection with repayment for amounts collected by PRONATEL for the advance payment and performance bonds. Per the terms of the insurance policies mentioned above, Quanta is required to remit million to the insurers as amounts are collected. Quanta is continuing to pursue collection of the remaining amount owed under the ICC arbitration award.

million, which included a reduction of previously recognized earnings on the project, a reserve against a portion of the project costs incurred through the project termination date, an accrual for a portion of the alleged liquidated damages, and the estimated costs to complete the project turnover and close out the project. Quanta also initially recorded a contract receivable of approximately million related to the project during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which includes the amounts collected by PRONATEL through exercise of the advance payment bonds and performance bonds. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of the receivable was not changed, however approximately million of such receivable was reclassified to a current asset during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and is included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The remaining approximately million of the receivable is included in Other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, with respect to the amounts received pursuant to coverage under the insurance policies described above, the million owed pursuant to the insurance policies was reclassified to a current liability during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 After considering, as discussed above, that the ultimate timing and conclusion with respect to collection of the full amounts associated with the ICC arbitration award remains unknown, Quanta has not recognized a gain in the current period. To the extent amounts in excess of the current receivable are determined to be realizable, a gain would be recorded in the period such determination is made. However, if Quanta is ultimately not successful with respect to collection of the ICC arbitration award or with respect to its claims in the pending ICSID arbitration proceeding, this matter could result in an additional significant loss that could have a material adverse effect on Quanta s consolidated results of operations and cash flows. 
 Silverado Wildfire Matter 
 During 2022 and 2023, two of Quanta s subsidiaries received tenders of defense and demands for preservation of evidence from Southern California Edison Company (SCE) related to lawsuits filed from April 2021 through September 2024 against SCE and T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile) in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange. The lawsuits generally assert property damage and related claims on behalf of certain individuals and subrogation claims on behalf of insurers relating to damages caused by a wildfire that began in October 2020 in Orange County, California (the Silverado Fire) and that is purported to have damaged approximately acres. The lawsuits allege the Silverado Fire originated from utility poles in the area, generally claiming that each defendant failed to adequately maintain, inspect, repair or replace its overhead facilities, equipment and utility poles and remove vegetation in the vicinity; that the utility poles were overloaded with equipment from shared usage; and that SCE failed to de-energize its facilities during red flag warnings for a Santa Ana wind event. The lawsuits

months before the Silverado Fire. Pursuant to the general terms of a master services agreement and a master consulting services agreement between the Quanta subsidiaries and SCE, the subsidiaries agreed to defend and indemnify SCE against certain claims arising with respect to performance or nonperformance under the agreements. The SCE tender letters seek contractual indemnification and defense from Quanta s subsidiaries for the claims asserted against SCE in the lawsuits and the T-Mobile cross-complaints. 
 Quanta s subsidiaries intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuits, the T-Mobile cross-complaints and any other claims asserted in connection with the Silverado Fire. Quanta will continue to review additional information in connection with this matter as litigation and resolution efforts progress, and any such information may potentially allow Quanta to determine an estimate of potential loss, if any. As of September 30, 2024, Quanta had recorded an accrual with respect to this matter, and Quanta is currently unable to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, if any, because there are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability. Quanta also believes that to the extent its subsidiaries are determined to be liable for any damages resulting from this matter, its insurance would be applied to any such liabilities over its deductible amount and its insurance coverage would be adequate to cover such potential liabilities. However, the ultimate amount of any potential liability and insurance coverage in connection with this matter remains subject to uncertainties associated with pending and potential future litigation. 
 Insurance 
 Quanta is insured for, among other things, employer s liability, workers compensation, auto liability, aviation and general liability claims. Quanta manages and maintains a portion of its casualty risk indirectly through its wholly-owned captive insurance company, which insures all claims up to the amount of the applicable deductible of its third-party insurance programs, as well as with respect to certain other amounts. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the gross amount accrued for employer s liability, workers compensation, auto liability, general liability, and group health claims totaled million and million, of which million and million are included in Insurance and other non-current liabilities, and the remainder is included in Accounts payables and accrued expenses. Related insurance recoveries/receivables as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were million and million, of which million and million are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and million and million are included in Other assets, net. 
 Bonds 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of the outstanding performance bonds was estimated to be approximately billion. Quanta s estimated maximum exposure related to the value of the performance bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced, and each commitment under a performance bond generally extinguishes concurrently with the expiration of its related contractual obligation. 
 Capital Commitments and Other Committed Expenditures 
 As of September 30, 2024, Quanta had million of outstanding capital commitments associated with investments in unconsolidated affiliates, the majority of which relates to a limited partnership interest in a fund that targets investments in certain portfolio companies that operate businesses related to the transition to a reduced-carbon economy. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Quanta had million of unfilled production orders primarily related to its fleet of vehicles, which have expected delivery dates during the remainder of 2024 and million which have expected delivery dates during 2025, in order to accommodate manufacturer lead times on certain types of vehicles. Although Quanta has committed to purchase these vehicles at the time of their delivery, Quanta anticipates that the majority of these orders will be assigned to third party leasing companies and made available under certain master equipment lease agreements, thereby releasing Quanta from its capital commitments.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 General 
 The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Quanta Services, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Quanta, we, us or our) should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and with our 2023 Annual Report, which was filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024 and is available on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.quantaservices.com . The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those identified in Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements and Information above, in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part II of this Quarterly Report and in Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of our 2023 Annual Report. 

Overview 
 Our third quarter 2024 results reflect increased demand for our services, as consolidated revenue and operating income increased as compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increased revenues and operating income for our Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions (Renewable Energy) segment. 
 With respect to our Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions (Electric Power) segment, utilities are continuing to invest significant capital in their electric power delivery systems through multi-year grid modernization and reliability programs, as well as system upgrades and hardening programs in response to recurring severe weather events. We have also experienced high demand for new and expanded transmission, substation and distribution infrastructure needed to reliably transport power. In particular, we continue to experience strong demand from our utility customers, which we believe is driven by increasing demand for electricity associated with, among other things, data centers and other technology-related dynamics, domestic manufacturing reshoring initiatives and overall electrification trends. Our acquisition of Cupertino Electric Inc. (CEI) has also created additional demand for our critical path electrical design and installation solutions from the technology and data center industry. 
 With respect to our Renewable Energy segment, the transition to a reduced-carbon economy as well as a meaningful increase in current and forecasted electricity demand is continuing to drive demand for renewable generation and related infrastructure (e.g., high-voltage electric transmission and substation infrastructure), as well as interconnection services necessary to connect and transmit renewable-generated electricity to existing electric power delivery systems. Despite these positive longer-term trends, during 2022 and into 2023, the timing of certain projects within this segment were negatively impacted by supply chain challenges that resulted in delays and shortages of, and increased costs for, materials necessary for certain projects, particularly sourcing restrictions related to solar panels necessary for the utility-scale solar industry and delays in availability of power transformers impacting the electric power and renewable energy industries. While certain challenges associated with solar panel sourcing improved during 2023, we could experience and continue to monitor other potential supply chain challenges that could impact the availability and/or cost of renewable infrastructure project components, including solar generation components, in future periods. 
 With respect to our Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions (Underground and Infrastructure) segment, during the third quarter of 2024, operating income margin was negatively impacted by cost absorption pressures across our gas operations in the United States and project delays for our industrial operations along the U.S. Gulf Coast due to Hurricanes Beryl and Francine. We continue to believe the market for our industrial solutions and gas utility and pipeline integrity services remains solid given the recurring critical-path maintenance requirements and regulated spend dedicated to modernizing systems, reducing methane emissions, ensuring environmental compliance and improving safety and reliability. Additionally, revenues associated with large pipeline projects have decreased in 2024 as compared to 2022 and 2023, and we anticipate that revenues associated with these projects will continue to fluctuate. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased revenues and operating income contributed to 1.37 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, a 139 increase compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which allowed us to execute our business plan, including the strategic acquisition of certain businesses, for which we utilized 1.72 billion of cash, net of cash acquired, and the payment of 40.8 million in dividends associated with our common stock. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, available commitments under our senior credit facility, combined with our cash and cash equivalents, totaled 3.28 billion. 
 Additionally, we entered into certain debt financing arrangements in connection with our acquisition of CEI. In July 2024, we entered into, and borrowed the full amount available under a 400.0 million 90-day term loan facility outside of the senior credit facility and utilized these borrowings, together with 1.20 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program 
 36 

and cash on hand, primarily to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of CEI and pay certain related costs and expenses and working capital requirements. In August 2024, we received net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of 1.24 billion, net of the original issue discount, underwriting discounts and deferred financing costs, which were used to repay certain borrowings that were utilized to acquire CEI. Additionally, on October 1, 2024, we repaid the 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.950 senior notes. These debt financing arrangements are more fully described in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report. 
 We expect the strong demand for our services will continue. Our remaining performance obligations and backlog were 15.61 billion and 33.96 billion as of September 30, 2024, representing increases of 12.3 and 12.8 relative to December 31, 2023. For a reconciliation of backlog to remaining performance obligations, the most comparable financial measure prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 

Significant Factors Impacting Results 
 Our revenues, profit, margins and other results of operations can be influenced by a variety of factors in any given period, including those described in Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I in our 2023 Annual Report, and those factors have caused fluctuations in our results in the past and are expected to cause fluctuations in our results in the future. Additional information with respect to certain of those factors is provided below. 
 Seasonality. Typically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions can create challenging working environments that are more costly for our customers or cause delays on projects. In addition, infrastructure projects often do not begin in a meaningful way until our customers finalize their capital budgets, which typically occurs during the first quarter. Second quarter revenues are typically higher than those in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often impact productivity. Third quarter revenues are typically the highest of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway and operating conditions, including weather, are normally more accommodating. Generally, revenues during the fourth quarter are lower than the third quarter but higher than the second quarter, as many projects are completed and customers often seek to spend their capital budgets before year end. However, the holiday season and inclement weather can sometimes cause delays during the fourth quarter, reducing revenues and increasing costs. These seasonal impacts are typical for our U.S. operations, but seasonality for our international operations may differ. For example, revenues for certain projects in Canada are typically higher in the first quarter because projects are often accelerated in order to complete work while the ground is frozen and prior to the break up, or seasonal thaw, as productivity is adversely affected by wet ground conditions during warmer months. 
 Weather, natural disasters and emergencies. The results of our business in a given period can be impacted by adverse weather conditions, severe weather events, natural disasters or other emergencies, which include, among other things, heavy or prolonged snowfall or rainfall, hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods, blizzards, extreme temperatures, wildfires, post-wildfire floods and debris flows, pandemics and earthquakes. Climate change has the potential to increase the frequency and extremity of severe weather events. These conditions and events can negatively impact our financial results due to, among other things, the termination, deferral or delay of projects, reduced productivity and exposure to significant liabilities due to failure of electrical power or other infrastructure on which we have performed services. However, severe weather events can also increase our emergency restoration services, which typically yield higher margins due in part to higher equipment utilization and absorption of fixed costs. 
 Demand for services . We perform the majority of our services under existing contracts, including MSAs and similar agreements pursuant to which our customers are not committed to specific volumes of our services. Therefore our volume of business can be positively or negatively affected by fluctuations in the amount of work our customers assign us in a given period, which may vary by geographic region. Examples of items that may cause demand for our services to fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter include: the financial condition of our customers, their capital spending and their access to and cost of capital; acceleration of any projects or programs by customers (e.g., modernization or hardening programs); economic and political conditions on a regional, national or global scale, including availability of renewable energy tax credits; interest rates; governmental regulations affecting the sourcing and costs of materials and equipment; other changes in U.S. and global trade relationships; and project deferrals and cancellations. 
 Revenue mix and impact on margins. The mix of revenues based on the types of services we provide in a given period will impact margins, as certain industries and services provide higher-margin opportunities. Our larger or more complex projects typically include, among others, transmission projects with higher voltage capacities; pipeline projects with larger-diameter throughput capacities; large-scale renewable generation projects; and projects with increased engineering, design or construction complexities, more difficult terrain or geographical requirements, or longer distance requirements. These projects typically yield opportunities for higher margins than our recurring services under MSAs described above, as we assume a 
 37 

greater degree of performance risk and there is greater utilization of our resources for longer construction timeframes. However, larger projects are subject to additional risk of regulatory delay and cyclicality. Project schedules also fluctuate, particularly in connection with larger, more complex or longer-term projects, which can affect the amount of work performed in a given period. Furthermore, smaller or less complex projects typically have a greater number of companies competing for them, and competitors at times may more aggressively pursue available work. A greater percentage of smaller scale or less complex work also could negatively impact margins due to the inefficiency of transitioning between a greater number of smaller projects versus continuous production on fewer larger projects. As a result, at times we may choose to maintain a portion of our workforce and equipment in an underutilized capacity to ensure we are strategically positioned to deliver on larger projects when they move forward. 
 Project variability and performance. Margins for a single project may fluctuate period to period due to changes in the volume or type of work performed, the pricing structure under the project contract or job productivity. Additionally, our productivity and performance on a project can vary period to period based on a number of factors, including unexpected project difficulties or site conditions (including in connection with difficult geographic characteristics); project location, including locations with challenging operating conditions; whether the work is on an open or encumbered right of way; inclement weather or severe weather events; environmental restrictions or regulatory delays; protests, public activism, other political activity or legal challenges related to a project; and the performance of third parties. Moreover, we currently generate a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts, and fixed price contracts are more common in connection with our larger and more complex projects that typically involve greater performance risk. Under these contracts, we assume risks related to project estimates and execution, and project revenues can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including the additional complexity, timing uncertainty or extended bidding, regulatory and permitting processes associated with these projects. These variations can result in a reduction in expected profit, the incurrence of losses on a project or the issuance of change orders and/or assertion of contract claims against customers. See Contract Estimates and Changes in Estimates in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report. 
 Subcontract work and provision of materials. Work that is subcontracted to other service providers generally yields lower margins, and therefore an increase in subcontract work in a given period can decrease operating margins. In recent years, we have subcontracted approximately 20 of our work to other service providers. Additionally, under certain contracts, including contracts for engineering, procurement and construction services, we agree to procure all or part of the required materials. While we attempt to structure our agreements with customers and suppliers to account for the impact of increased materials procurement requirements or fluctuations in the cost of materials we procure, our margins may be lower on projects where we furnish a significant amount of materials, as our markup on materials is generally lower than our markup on labor costs, and in a given period an increase in the percentage of work with greater materials procurement requirements may decrease our overall margins, including in some cases our assuming price risk. Furthermore, fluctuations in the price or availability of materials, equipment and consumables that we or our customers utilize could impact costs to complete projects.

 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Revenues 6,493,167 100.0 5,620,822 100.0 872,345 15.5 Cost of services 5,480,597 84.4 4,773,498 84.9 707,099 14.8 Gross profit 1,012,570 15.6 847,324 15.1 165,246 19.5 Equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates 14,015 0.2 11,707 0.2 2,308 19.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses (483,878) (7.5) (386,538) (6.9) (97,340) 25.2 Amortization of intangible assets (110,422) (1.7) (71,361) (1.3) (39,061) 54.7 Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities (1,124) (803) (321) 40.0 Operating income 431,161 6.6 400,329 7.1 30,832 7.7 Interest and other financing expenses (59,950) (0.9) (47,531) (0.8) (12,419) 26.1 Interest income 7,237 0.1 1,993 5,244 263.1 Other income (expense), net 2,994 0.1 (3,744) (0.1) 6,738 Income before income taxes 381,442 5.9 351,047 6.2 30,395 8.7 Provision for income taxes 82,421 1.3 77,522 1.3 4,899 6.3 Net income 299,021 4.6 273,525 4.9 25,496 9.3 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 5,836 0.1 689 5,147 747.0 Net income attributable to common stock 293,185 4.5 272,836 4.9 20,349 7.5 The percentage change is not meaningful. 
 Revenues. Revenues increased due to a 505.2 million increase in revenues from our Renewable Energy segment and a 492.5 million increase in revenues from our Electric Power segment, partially offset by a 125.4 million decrease in revenues from our Underground and Infrastructure segment. See Segment Results below for additional information and discussion related to segment revenues. 
 Cost of services. Costs of services primarily includes wages, benefits, subcontractor costs, materials, equipment, and other direct and indirect costs, including related depreciation. The increase in cost of services generally correlates to the increase in revenues. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase was primarily attributable to a 55.7 million increase related to recently acquired businesses and a 29.6 million increase in compensation expense, largely associated with increased salaries due primarily to an increase in number of employees to support business growth and increased incentive compensation due primarily to increased levels of profitability. Also contributing to the increase was a 7.8 million increase in expense related to deferred compensation liabilities. The fair market value changes in deferred compensation liabilities were largely offset by changes in the fair value of corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) assets associated with the deferred compensation plan, which are included in Other income (expense), net as discussed below. 
 Amortization of intangible assets. The increase was related to incremental amortization expense associated with recent acquisitions, including CEI. 
 Operating income. Operating income was positively impacted by a 70.1 million increase in operating income for our Renewable Energy segment and a 58.3 million increase in operating income for our Electric Power segment, partially offset by a 29.8 million decrease in operating income for our Underground and Infrastructure segment and a 67.8 million increase in corporate and non-allocated costs, which includes amortization expense. Results for each of our business segments and our corporate and non-allocated costs are discussed in Segment Results below. 
 Interest and other financing expenses. Approximately half of the increase resulted from higher levels of debt as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 39 

Other income (expense), net. The increase was primarily attributable to an 8.3 million increase in the mark-to-market valuation adjustment of the COLI assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. The fair market value changes of the COLI assets were largely offset by changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation liabilities, which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above. 
 Provision for income taxes . The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 21.6 and 22.1 . The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by the recognition of a 25.3 million tax benefit that resulted from equity incentive awards vesting at a higher fair market value than their grant date fair value as compared to the recognition of 1.6 million associated with this tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was favorably impacted by the realization of a loss attributable to our investment in Starry Group Holdings, Inc. (Starry), and the corresponding release of the 22.7 million valuation allowance initially recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Comprehensive income. See Statements of Comprehensive Income in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report. Comprehensive income increased by 75.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 49.7 million increase related to foreign currency translation adjustments and a 25.5 million increase in net income. The predominant functional currencies for our operations outside the U.S. are Canadian and Australian dollars. Foreign currency translation gains for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian and Australian dollars. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The following table sets forth selected statements of operations data, such data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated, as well as the dollar and percentage change from the prior period (dollars in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Revenues 17,119,373 100.0 15,098,258 100.0 2,021,115 13.4 Cost of services (including related depreciation) 14,671,978 85.7 12,953,640 85.8 1,718,338 13.3 Gross profit 2,447,395 14.3 2,144,618 14.2 302,777 14.1 Equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates 34,935 0.2 30,697 0.2 4,238 13.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses (1,318,574) (7.7) (1,155,261) (7.7) (163,313) 14.1 Amortization of intangible assets (267,147) (1.6) (213,789) (1.4) (53,358) 25.0 Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities (2,864) (803) (2,061) 256.7 Operating income 893,745 5.2 805,462 5.3 88,283 11.0 Interest and other financing expenses (146,343) (0.9) (137,413) (0.9) (8,930) 6.5 Interest income 18,817 0.1 4,957 13,860 279.6 Other income, net 29,493 0.2 7,541 0.1 21,952 291.1 Income before income taxes 795,712 4.6 680,547 4.5 115,165 16.9 Provision for income taxes 178,716 1.0 143,468 0.9 35,248 24.6 Net income 616,996 3.6 537,079 3.6 79,917 14.9 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 17,292 0.1 3,298 0.1 13,994 424.3 Net income attributable to common stock 599,704 3.5 533,781 3.5 65,923 12.4 The percentage change is not meaningful. 
 Revenues. Revenues increased due to a 1.73 billion increase in revenues from our Renewable Energy segment and a 520.6 million increase in revenues from our Electric Power segment, partially offset by a 225.6 million decrease in revenues from our Underground and Infrastructure segment. See Segment Results below for additional information and discussion related to segment revenues. 
 Cost of services. Costs of services primarily includes wages, benefits, subcontractor costs, materials, equipment, and other direct and indirect costs, including related depreciation. The increase in cost of services generally correlates to the increase in revenues. 
 40 

Selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase was primarily attributable to a 93.6 million increase related to recently acquired businesses; a 31.7 million increase in compensation expense, largely associated with increased salaries, incentive compensation and non-cash stock compensation expense due primarily to an increase in number of employees to support business growth and increased incentive compensation due primarily to increased levels of profitability; a 17.9 million increase in travel and related expenses to support business growth; and an 11.9 million loss on the disposal of a non-core business. Also contributing to the increase was an 8.4 million increase in expense related to deferred compensation liabilities. The fair market value changes in deferred compensation liabilities were largely offset by changes in the fair value of COLI assets associated with the deferred compensation plan, which are included in Other income (expense), net as discussed below. 
 Amortization of intangible assets. The increase was related to incremental amortization expense associated with recent acquisitions, including CEI. 
 Operating income. Operating income was positively impacted by a 161.5 million increase in operating income for our Renewable Energy segment and a 91.0 million increase in operating income for our Electric Power segment, partially offset by a 70.1 million decrease in operating income for our Underground and Infrastructure segment and a 94.2 million increase in corporate and non-allocated costs, which includes amortization expense. Results for each of our business segments and corporate and non-allocated costs are discussed in Segment Results below. 
 Interest and other financing expenses. Approximately half of the increase resulted from higher interest rates as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest income. Interest income increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent accounts and interest earned on certain receivable balances with customers. 
 Other income (expense), net. The increase was primarily attributable to a gain of 12.6 million resulting from the sale of an investment in a non-integral unconsolidated affiliate, 5.0 million of which was attributable to a non-controlling interest, as further described in Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report. The increase was also attributable to a 9.3 million increase in the mark-to-market valuation adjustment of the COLI assets associated with our deferred compensation plan. The fair market value changes of the COLI assets were largely offset by changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation liabilities, which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses as discussed above. 
 Provision for income taxes. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 22.5 and 21.1 . The tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by the recognition of a 47.8 million benefit that resulted from equity incentive awards vesting at a higher fair market value than their grant date fair market value, as compared to the recognition of 34.0 million associated with this tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was favorably impacted by the realization of the loss on the Starry investment for tax purposes, and the corresponding release of the valuation allowance initially recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests. The increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interests is primarily related to increased activity on certain joint ventures and the 5.0 million gain on the sale of the investment in a non-integral equity unconsolidated affiliate recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as described above. 
 Comprehensive income. See Statements of Comprehensive Income in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report. Comprehensive income increased by 64.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 79.9 million increase in net income, partially offset by a 14.3 million decrease in foreign currency translation adjustments. The predominant functional currencies for our operations outside the U.S. are Canadian and Australian dollars. Foreign currency translation losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. 

Segment Results 
 We report our results under three reportable segments: Electric Power, Renewable Energy and Underground and Infrastructure. Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is gathered from each of our operating companies. Classification of our operating company revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Integrated operations and common administrative support for operating companies require that certain allocations be made to determine segment profitability, including allocations of corporate shared and indirect operating costs, as well as general and administrative costs. Certain corporate costs are not allocated, including corporate facility costs; non-allocated corporate salaries, benefits and incentive compensation; acquisition 
 41 

and integration costs; non-cash stock-based compensation; amortization related to intangible assets; asset impairments related to goodwill and intangible assets; and change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.

Electric Power Segment Results 
 Revenues . The increase in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to approximately 450 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses and the overall mix of work performed during the period, which included higher emergency restoration services revenues as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating Income . The increase in operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the increase in revenues. Operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by higher margin emergency restoration services revenues offset by lower operating margins associated with telecommunication projects. 
 Renewable Energy Segment Results 
 Revenues . The increase in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increased demand for generation and transmission services for renewable generation projects, as well as approximately 150 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. 
 Operating Income . The increase in operating income and operating margin was partially due to the increase in revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the negative impact during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to variability in overall project timing and increased unabsorbed costs related to higher levels of fixed costs for resources required to support the future increase in project activity. 
 Underground and Infrastructure Segment Results 
 Revenues . The decrease in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower revenues from large pipeline projects, partially offset by approximately 55 million in revenues attributable to an acquired business. 
 Operating Income . The decrease in operating income and operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to decreased revenues, which contributed to lower levels of fixed cost absorption, as well as the overall mix of work performed in the period. 
 Corporate and Non-Allocated Costs 
 The increase in corporate and non-allocated costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 39.1 million increase in amortization of intangible assets and a 11.6 million increase in compensation expense, which was attributable to increased salaries and incentive compensation expense in support of business growth.

Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions Segment Results 
 Revenues . The increase in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to approximately 570 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses and higher emergency restoration services revenues as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases are partially offset by the timing of work and a shift of resources to meet the demand in the Renewable Energy segment. 
 Operating Income . The increase in operating income and operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the increase in revenues, change in the overall mix of work, including an increase in higher margin emergency restoration services, partially offset by lower operating margins associated with telecommunication projects. 
 Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions Segment Results 
 Revenues . The increase in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increased demand for generation and transmission services for renewable generation projects, as well as approximately 155 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. 
 Operating Income . The increase in operating income and operating margin was primarily due to the increase in revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by decreased productivity and increased costs on various solar projects in the United States. Additionally, operating income and operating margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were negatively impacted by delays, logistical challenges and other issues outside of our control that increased costs associated with a large renewable energy project in Canada. 
 Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions Segment Results 
 Revenues . The decrease in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower revenues from large pipeline projects, partially offset by approximately 170 million in revenues attributable to an acquired business. 
 Operating Income. The decrease in operating income and operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to decreased revenues and overall mix of work performed during the period, which contributed to lower levels of fixed cost absorption, and an 11.9 million loss recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the disposition of a non-core business. 
 Corporate and Non-Allocated Costs 
 The increase in corporate and non-allocated costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 53.4 million increase in intangible asset amortization and a 23.5 million increase in compensation expense, which was attributable to increased salaries, incentive compensation and non-cash stock compensation expense in support of business growth.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, financial measures not recognized under GAAP, when used in connection with net income attributable to common stock, are intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate our performance. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other financing expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain other items as described below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stock or other financial measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net income attributable to common stock enables us and our investors to more effectively evaluate our operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent due to, among other reasons, the variable nature of these items period over period. In addition, management believes these measures may be useful for investors in comparing our operating results with other companies that may be viewed as our peers. 
 As to certain of the items below, (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) acquisition and integration costs vary from period to period depending on the level and complexity of our acquisition activity; (iii) equity in (earnings) losses of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates varies from period to period depending on the activity and financial performance of such affiliates, the operations of which are not operationally integral to us; (iv) gains and losses on the sale of investments and businesses vary from period to period depending on activity; and (v) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses and the effect of present value accretion on fair value calculations. Because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below. The following table shows dollars in thousands: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income attributable to common stock (GAAP as reported) 293,185 272,836 599,704 533,781 Interest and other financing expenses 59,950 47,531 146,343 137,413 Interest income (7,237) (1,993) (18,817) (4,957) Provision for income taxes 82,421 77,522 178,716 143,468 Depreciation expense 89,979 81,488 262,525 239,746 Amortization of intangible assets 110,422 71,361 267,147 213,789 Interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization included in equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates 5,384 5,256 15,608 14,538 EBITDA 634,104 554,001 1,451,226 1,277,778 Non-cash stock-based compensation 38,234 32,600 110,815 94,658 Acquisition and integration costs

 (1) The amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is a loss of 11.9 million on the disposition of a non-core business, partially offset by a gain of 7.5 million as a result of the sale of a non-integral equity method investment. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations and Backlog 
 A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service. Our remaining performance obligations represent management s estimate of consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the remaining portion of firm orders under fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work has not yet begun, which includes estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities, revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to be realized, and revenues from change orders and claims to the extent management believes they will be earned and are probable of collection. 
 44 

We have also historically disclosed our backlog, a measure commonly used in our industry but not recognized under GAAP. We believe this measure enables management to more effectively forecast our future capital needs and results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. We believe this measure is also useful for investors in forecasting our future results and comparing us to our competitors. Our remaining performance obligations are a component of backlog, which also includes estimated orders under MSAs, including estimated renewals, and certain non-fixed price contracts. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, MSAs accounted for 38 and 45 of our estimated 12-month backlog and 49 and 55 of our total backlog. Generally, our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under our MSAs, and most of our contracts can be terminated on short notice even if we are not in default. We determine the estimated backlog for these MSAs using recurring historical trends, factoring in seasonal demand and projected customer needs based upon ongoing communications. In addition, many of our MSAs are subject to renewal, and these potential renewals are considered in determining estimated backlog. As a result, estimates for remaining performance obligations and backlog are subject to change based on, among other things, project accelerations; project cancellations or delays, including but not limited to those caused by commercial issues, regulatory requirements, natural disasters, emergencies and adverse weather conditions; and final acceptance of change orders by customers. These factors can cause revenues to be realized in periods and at levels that are different than originally projected. 
 The following table reconciles total remaining performance obligations to our backlog (a non-GAAP financial measure) by reportable segment along with estimates of amounts expected to be realized within 12 months (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 12 Month Total 12 Month Total Electric Power Remaining performance obligations 4,276,630 7,081,450 2,762,608 4,505,830 Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts 5,935,083 12,868,759 5,597,732 10,995,198 Backlog 10,211,713 19,950,209 8,360,340 15,501,028 Renewable Energy Remaining performance obligations 5,230,590 7,138,365 5,512,159 8,005,368 Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts 301,359 432,580 118,770 119,634 Backlog 5,531,949 7,570,945 5,630,929 8,125,002 Underground and Infrastructure Remaining performance obligations 1,161,919 1,389,715 1,017,227 1,383,057 Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts 2,220,595 5,053,421 2,222,451 5,099,332 Backlog 3,382,514 6,443,136 3,239,678 6,482,389 Total Remaining performance obligations 10,669,139 15,609,530 9,291,994 13,894,255 Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts 8,457,037 18,354,760 7,938,953 16,214,164 Backlog 19,126,176 33,964,290 17,230,947 30,108,419 
 The increases in both remaining performance obligations and backlog from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 were partially due to the impact of acquisitions that occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as well as increased new project awards with existing customers, and the increase in backlog was also attributable to new project awards included in the Electric Power segment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We plan to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and other cash requirements with our current available liquidity and cash from operations, which could be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Management monitors financial markets and national and global economic conditions for factors that may affect our liquidity and capital resources. 
 Our capital deployment priorities that require the use of cash include: (i) working capital to fund ongoing operating needs, (ii) capital expenditures to meet anticipated demand for our services, (iii) acquisitions and investments to facilitate the long-term growth and sustainability of our business, and (iv) return of capital to stockholders, including through the payment of dividends and repurchases of our outstanding common stoc k . We intend to fund these requirements primarily with cash flow from operating activities, as well as debt financing as needed. 
 Cash Requirements and Capital Allocation 
 In July 2024, and as described below, we entered into, and borrowed the full amount available under, a new 400 million 90-day term loan facility, borrowed approximately 1.2 billion under our commercial paper program and amended our credit facility. In August 2024, we issued 1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and received net proceeds of 1.24 billion and used the proceeds to repay certain borrowings that were utilized to acquire CEI. These debt financing arrangements and interest related to such arrangements are more fully described in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report. Additionally, on October 1, 2024, we repaid the 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.950 senior notes due October 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no other material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the specified contractual obligations or changes to our capital allocation priorities as set forth in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of the 2023 Annual Report. 
 We anticipate that our future cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility and commercial paper program and ability to access capital markets for additional capital will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months and over the longer term. 
 Significant Sources of Cash 
 Cash flow from operating activities is primarily influenced by demand for our services and operating margins but is also influenced by the timing of working capital needs associated with the various types of services that we provide. Our working capital needs may increase when we commence large volumes of work under circumstances where project costs are required to be paid before the associated receivables are billed and collected. Additionally, operating cash flows can be negatively impacted as a result of unpaid and delayed change orders and claims. Changes in project timing due to delays or accelerations and other economic, regulatory, market and political factors that may affect customer spending could also impact cash flow from operating activities. Further information with respect to our cash flow from operating activities is set forth below and in Note 16 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report . 
 46 

Our available commitments under our senior credit facility and cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 Total capacity available for revolving loans, credit support for commercial paper program and letters of credit 2,800,000 Less: Borrowings of revolving loans 58,987 Letters of credit outstanding 226,100 Available commitments for revolving loans, credit support for commercial paper program and letters of credit 2,514,913 Plus: Cash and cash equivalents (1) 
 764,067 Total available commitments under senior credit facility and cash and cash equivalents 3,278,980 
 (1) Further information with respect to our cash and cash equivalents is set forth below and in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report. This amount includes 303.0 million in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., principally in Australia. There are currently no legal or economic restrictions that would materially impede our ability to repatriate such cash. 
 On July 31, 2024, we amended our senior credit facility to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitments for revolving loans from 2.64 billion to 2.80 billion and (ii) extend the maturity date for revolving loans under the senior credit facility from October 8, 2026 to July 31, 2029. In August 2024, we issued 1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and received net proceeds of 1.24 billion and used the proceeds to repay certain borrowings that were utilized to acquire CEI. For additional information regarding the amendment to our senior credit facility and the issuance of the senior notes, see Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report. 
 We consider our investment policies related to cash and cash equivalents to be conservative, as we maintain a diverse portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality cash and cash equivalent investments with short-term maturities. Additionally, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement for our senior credit facility, we have the option to increase the capacity of our senior credit facility, in the form of an increase in the revolving commitments, term loans or a combination thereof, from time to time, upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders by up to an additional (i) 400.0 million plus (ii) additional amounts so long as the Incremental Leverage Ratio Requirement (as defined in the credit agreement) is satisfied at the time of such increase. The Incremental Leverage Ratio Requirement requires, among other things, after giving pro forma effect to such increase and the use of proceeds therefrom, compliance with the credit agreement s financial covenants as of the most recent fiscal quarter end for which financial statements were required to be delivered. Further information with respect to our debt obligations is set forth in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report . 
 We may seek to access the capital markets from time to time to raise additional capital, increase liquidity as we deem necessary, refinance or extend the term of our existing indebtedness, fund acquisitions or otherwise fund our capital needs. While our financial strategy and consistent performance have allowed us to maintain investment grade ratings, our ability to access capital markets in the future depends on a number of factors, including our financial performance and financial position, our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, our backlog, capital expenditure commitments, market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash During the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,369,181 572,414 Net cash used in investing activities (2,127,148) (722,324) Net cash provided by financing activities 
 227,427 31,051 
 47 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 1.37 billion and 572.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for non-cash items and cash provided and used by the main components of working capital: Accounts and notes receivable, Contract assets, Accounts payable and accrued expenses, and Contract liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by incremental working capital requirements and the timing of billings related to the large renewable transmission project in Canada as discussed further in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report. 
 As discussed above, cash flow provided by operating activities is primarily influenced by demand for our services and operating margins but is also influenced by working capital needs. Our working capital needs may increase when we commence large volumes of work under circumstances where project costs, primarily labor, equipment and subcontractors, are required to be paid before the associated receivables are billed and collected and when we incur costs for work that is the subject of unpaid change orders and claims. Accordingly, changes within working capital in accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities are normally related and are typically affected on a collective basis by changes in revenue due to the timing and volume of work performed and variability in the timing of customer billings and payments, as well as change orders and claims. Additionally, working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and fall due to increased demand for our services when favorable weather conditions exist in many of our operating regions. Conversely, working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the winter. These seasonal trends can be offset by changes in project timing due to delays or accelerations and other economic factors that may affect customer spending, including market conditions or the impact of certain unforeseen events (e.g., regulatory and other actions that impact the supply chain for certain materials). 
 Days sales outstanding (DSO) represents the average number of days it takes revenues to be converted into cash, which management believes is an important metric for assessing liquidity. A decrease in DSO has a favorable impact on cash flow from operating activities, while an increase in DSO has a negative impact on cash flow from operating activities. DSO is calculated by using the sum of current accounts receivable, net of allowance (which includes retainage and unbilled balances), plus contract assets, less contract liabilities, and divided by average revenues per day during the quarter. DSO as of September 30, 2024 was 65 days, which was lower than DSO of 79 days as of September 30, 2023 and lower than our five-year historical average DSO of 80 days. This decrease in DSO as compared to September 30, 2023 was partially due to an increase in contract liabilities related to favorable billing terms on certain large projects and increased revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as well as improved collection of customer receivables. Although the decrease in DSO had a positive impact on cash flow from operating activities, unapproved change orders and claims included in contract assets from the aforementioned large renewable transmission project in Canada continued to negatively impact DSO and cash flow from operating activities as of and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 1.72 billion related to acquisitions, 457.1 million of capital expenditures and 72.6 million cash paid primarily for non-integral equity method investments. Partially offsetting these items were 67.2 million of proceeds from the sale of, and insurance settlements related to, property and equipment; 31.2 million of proceeds from the disposition of a non-core business and 29.2 million of proceeds from the sale of a non-integral equity investment. 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 472.6 million related to acquisitions and 325.4 million of capital expenditures. Partially offsetting these items were 48.0 million of proceeds from the sale of, and insurance settlements related to, property and equipment and 42.3 million of proceeds from the sale of non-integral equity investments. 
 Our industry is capital intensive, and we expect substantial capital expenditures and commitments for equipment purchases and equipment lease and rental arrangements to be needed for the foreseeable future in order to meet anticipated demand for our services. In addition, we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, although we cannot predict the timing or amount of the cash needed for these initiatives. We also have various other capital commitments that are detailed primarily in Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report. 
 48 

Financing Activities 
 In July 2024, we entered into, and borrowed the full amount available under, a 400.0 million 90-day term loan facility outside of our senior credit facility and utilized these borrowings, together with 1.2 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program and cash on hand, to finance the acquisition of CEI, as well as pay certain related costs and expenses and fund certain working capital requirements. On August 9, 2024, we received net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of 1.24 billion, including 2.8 million of deferred financing costs paid of accrued by us, but net of the original issue discount and underwriting discounts and used the proceeds to repay certain borrowings utilized to acquire CEI, including the full amount of the short-term term loan. Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 791.0 million of net repayments under our senior credit facility and commercial paper program. Financing costs paid directly by us during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 7.6 million, which related to the August 2024 issuance of senior notes, the short-term term loan and the amendment of our senior credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also partially offset by 140.6 million of payments to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based compensation and the payment of 40.8 million of dividends. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 203.6 million of net borrowings under our senior credit facility and commercial paper program, partially offset by 113.4 million of payments to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based compensation and the payment of 36.1 million of dividends. 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 1, 2024, we repaid the 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.950 senior notes due October 2024. 
 We expect to continue to utilize cash for similar financing activities in the future, including repayments of our outstanding debt, payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock and/or debt securities. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain information and footnote disclosures, normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are published and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. We review all significant estimates affecting our condensed consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Management has reviewed its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. Our accounting policies are primarily described in Notes 2 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Part II of the 2023 Annual Report and should be read in conjunction with the accounting policies identified in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Part II of our 2023 Annual Report, which we believe affect our more significant estimates. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 There were no material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Refer to the information on financial market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of Part II of our 2023 Annual Report. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Attached as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are certifications of Quanta s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). This Item 4. section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. 
 49 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management has established and maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b), as such disclosure controls and procedures are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. 
 Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We acquired eight businesses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We are in the process of integrating these acquired businesses into our overall internal control over financial reporting process. 
 Except as noted above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Design and Operation of Control Systems 
 Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 
 50 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, negligence or gross negligence and/or property damage, environmental liabilities, wage and hour claims and other employment-related damages, punitive damages, consequential damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief, as well as interest and attorneys fees associated with such claims. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record a reserve when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose matters for which management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. See Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report, which is incorporated by reference in this Item 1, for additional information regarding litigation, claims and other legal proceedings. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Item 103 of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters in which a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and when such proceedings involve the potential for monetary sanctions that management reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. Pursuant to SEC regulations, we use a threshold of 1.0 million for such proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. For a detailed discussion of the risks that affect our business, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of our 2023 Annual Report. As of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously described in our 2023 Annual Report. The matters specifically identified are not the only risks and uncertainties facing our company, and risks and uncertainties not known to us or not specifically identified also may impair our business operations. If any of these risks and uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected, which could negatively impact the value of an investment in our company.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 On July 17, 2024 and September 20, 2024, we completed acquisitions in which a portion of the consideration consisted of the unregistered issuance of our common stock. The aggregate consideration paid at closing in these acquisitions consisted of 930,973 shares of our common stock, valued at 230.2 million as of the acquisition dates. 
 The shares of common stock issued in these transactions were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the shares were issued to the owners of the businesses acquired in privately negotiated transactions not involving any public offering or solicitation. 
 For additional information about these acquisitions, see Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of Part I of this Quarterly Report .

Repurchases can be made in open market and privately negotiated transactions, at our discretion, based on market and business conditions, applicable contractual and legal requirements and other factors. The program does not obligate us to acquire any specific amount of common stock and may be modified or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time at its sole discretion and without notice.
