 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. territories, and the vast majority of eligible political subdivisions and federally recognized Native American tribes to resolve opioid-related claims against the Company. Remaining eligible political subdivisions and federally recognized Native American tribes have until July 15, 2025 and February 24, 2026, respectively, to join these settlements. In fiscal year 2023, the Company accrued a liability of approximately billion for these settlements, which include amounts for remediation of alleged harms, attorneys' fees, and costs. As of January 31, 2024, substantially all of the approximately billion accrued liability had been paid. 
 Ongoing Opioid-Related Litigation 
 The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related matters not settled or otherwise resolved, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by healthcare providers, individuals and third-party payers; and any action filed by a political subdivision or Native American tribe that elects not to join the settlement described above. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of the opioid-related matters and no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. 
 Opioid Multidistrict Litigation; Other Opioid-Related Matters in the U.S. and Canada . In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some cases included in the MDL. 
 A trial involving claims brought by counties against certain defendants, including the Company, in the MDL resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022 that ordered all defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately billion over years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023 and has not materially impacted the Company's operations. On September 11, 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order certifying

 cases brought by third-party payers as bellwether cases to proceed through discovery. The MDL may designate additional bellwether cases in the future. 
 The Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. 
 Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company have been named as defendants in putative class action complaints filed in Canada related to distribution practices involving opioids. These matters remain pending. 
 Department of Justice Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. On March 11, 2024, the Court granted in-part Walmart's motion to dismiss by dismissing the entirety of the DOJ's claims related to distribution and dismissing the DOJ's claims arising under one of the DOJ's two dispensing liability theories. The DOJ's claims arising under its other dispensing liability theory remain pending. Trial is scheduled for November 2027. 
 Opioid-Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation. The Company is the subject of securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017 through December 22, 2020. Those actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in 2021 and later consolidated. On April 8, 2024, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss these actions. On April 29, 2024, the plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where the matter remains pending. 
 shareholders of the Company filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain current and former directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties by failing to adequately oversee the Company's distribution and dispensing of prescription opioids. This action is Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund, et al. v. Walton, et al. , Delaware Court of Chancery, Case No. 2021-0827-JTL ("Ontario Action"). Other shareholders of the Company filed derivative actions alleging that certain current and former directors and officers breached fiduciary duties and violated federal securities laws in connection with the Company's distribution and dispensing of prescription opioids. These actions are Abt v. Alvarez, et al. , U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, Case No. 21-cv-00172-CFC and Nguyen v. McMillon, et al. , U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, Case No. 21-cv-00551-CFC (collectively with the Ontario Action, the "Derivative Actions"). On May 5, 2023, the Walmart Board of Directors adopted resolutions creating a special litigation committee ("SLC") to investigate, review, and analyze the facts and circumstances surrounding the claims and allegations in the Derivative Actions and determine whether the prosecution of such claims is in Walmart's best interest. 
 On October 18, 2024, the Company announced that the parties to the Ontario Action and the SLC entered into a settlement agreement, subject to court approval, that would resolve the Derivative Actions and release other potential derivative claims. If the Delaware Court of Chancery approves the proposed settlement: (i) insurance carriers would pay the Company million, less any attorneys' fees and litigation expenses awarded by the Court to plaintiffs' counsel; and (ii) the Company would maintain certain corporate governance practices for a period of at least . The settlement does not include any admission of liability, and the defendants expressly deny any wrongdoing. The Company has provided notice of the settlement to shareholders as directed by Court Order. The Court has scheduled a hearing on December 20, 2024 to consider whether to approve the settlement. If approved, the Company will record the net proceeds as a reduction to operating, selling, general, and administrative expense in the period realized. 
 False Claims Act Litigation. On August 23, 2019, a qui tam action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico. The action was partially unsealed on April 30, 2024 after the federal government declined to intervene. The DOJ informed the Company of its decision not to intervene on June 20, 2024. On July 25, 2024, the Court transferred the litigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The operative complaint is brought by former pharmacists of the Company as relators and alleges the Company violated the Controlled Substances Act and state pharmacy regulations and that such conduct constitutes violations of the federal False Claims Act. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on October 31, 2024.

 reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. 
 The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. 
 The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s ("Walmart," the "Company," "our," or "we") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025 ("fiscal 2025") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 ("fiscal 2024"), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2024, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024. 
 We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. 
 Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. 
 Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs, as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our ecosystem, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. 
 Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a relatively consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
 We operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses, and companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain and inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. 
 Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under " Item 5. Other Information ."

 We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to inflationary trends, a challenging macro environment, geopolitical conditions, supply chain disruptions, volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to " Results of Operations " below. 

Company Performance Metrics 
 We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows: 
 Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience; 
 Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and 
 Returns - improve our Return on Investment through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend. 
 
 Growth 
 Our objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy. 
 Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We focus on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year. 
 Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 5.1 4.9 (0.2) 0.1 4.7 6.1 (0.1) (0.1) Sam's Club 3.8 2.9 (3.4) (0.5) 4.3 2.4 (1.7) (3.0) Total U.S. 4.9 4.6 (0.7) 0.0 4.7 5.5 (0.3) (0.6) 
 Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 4.9 and 4.7 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 5.1 and 4.7 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, driven by growth in transactions and unit volumes, with strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce net sales positively contributed approximately 2.8 to comparable sales for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, which was primarily driven by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery. 
 Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 3.8 and 4.3 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, driven by growth in transactions and unit volumes, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.7 and 2.1 to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by club-fulfilled curbside pickup and delivery.

 Margin 
 Our objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a combination of productivity improvements, as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs, and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. Additionally, we focus on our mix of businesses, including the expansion of connected value streams with higher margins, such as advertising and membership income. Our objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales. 
 Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net sales 168,003 159,439 495,708 470,723 Percentage change from comparable period 5.4 5.3 5.3 6.2 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 24.2 24.0 24.2 23.9 Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.2 21.0 20.9 20.5 Operating income 6,708 6,202 21,489 19,758 Percentage change from comparable period 8.2 130.1 8.8 32.9 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.0 3.9 4.3 4.2 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate") increased 21 and 35 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment due to managing prices aligned to our competitive price gaps, as well as growth in higher margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower margin merchandise categories and the timing of Flipkart's The Big Billion Days ("BBD") sales event in the Walmart International segment, which shifted from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 to primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 19 and 32 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively. The increase for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily driven by hurricane-related recovery expenses incurred in the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, higher marketing expenses and higher variable pay as a result of exceeding planned performance. The increase for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily driven by higher variable pay as a result of exceeding planned performance, higher marketing expenses and business reorganization costs of 0.3 billion incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Operating income increased 0.5 billion or 8.2 and 1.7 billion or 8.8 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, primarily due to the factors described above as well as from strong growth in membership income globally. 
 
 Returns 
 As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. 
 Return on Assets and Return on Investment 
 We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP") and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 7.8 and 6.5 for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing 12 month period, as a result of higher operating income. ROI was 15.1 and 14.1 for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income, primarily due to improvements in business performance as well as lapping business reorganization and restructuring charges incurred in the comparative trailing 12 months, partially offset by an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. 
 We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.

Table of Contents 

 Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 
 The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:

 Strategic Capital Allocation 
 Our strategy includes allocating the majority of our capital to higher-return areas focused on automation such as eCommerce, supply chain and store and club investments. The following table provides additional detail regarding our capital expenditures:

 Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by or used in financing activities. 
 We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was 22.9 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, which represents an increase of 3.9 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating income and lapping the payment of accrued opioid legal charges in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by increased inventory purchases. Free cash flow for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was 6.2 billion, which represents an increase of 1.9 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow was due to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities described above, partially offset by an increase of 2.0 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. 
 Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by or used in financing activities.

 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales but also include membership and other income, increased 8.8 billion or 5.5 and 25.7 billion or 5.4 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales in our U.S. segments and international markets driven by growth in transactions and unit volumes, with strength in eCommerce as well as strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Net sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 were negatively affected by 1.2 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively, due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Membership and other income increased 0.2 billion or 16.1 and 0.7 billion or 17.7 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, primarily due to strong growth in membership income globally. 
 Gross profit rate increased 21 and 35 basis points for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment due to managing prices aligned to our competitive price gaps, as well as growth in higher margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower margin merchandise categories and the timing of Flipkart's BBD sales event in the Walmart International segment. 
 Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 19 and 32 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily driven by hurricane-related recovery expenses incurred in the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, higher marketing expenses and higher variable pay as a result of exceeding planned performance. The increase for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily driven by higher variable pay as a result of exceeding planned performance, higher marketing expenses and business reorganization costs of 0.3 billion incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. The net decreases of 4.6 billion and 3.3 billion in other losses for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, were primarily due to changes in the fair value of our equity and other investments driven by changes in their underlying stock prices. 
 Our effective income tax rate was 22.7 and 23.8 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, compared to 29.7 and 26.1 for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to the tax impact on changes in fair value of our investments. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. 
 As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased 4.1 billion for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was 0.57 and 1.75 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, which represents an increase of 0.51 for both periods when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.

 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased 5.5 billion or 5.0 and 14.7 billion or 4.5 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 5.1 and 4.7 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, driven by growth in transactions and unit volumes, with strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.8 to comparable sales for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, which was primarily driven by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery. 
 Gross profit rate increased 42 and 46 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by managing prices aligned to our competitive price gaps and growth in higher margin businesses, partially offset by mix shifts into lower margin merchandise categories. 
 Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 33 and 41 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily due to hurricane-related recovery expenses and increased marketing and depreciation expenses. The increase for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily related to increased marketing and depreciation expenses, as well as higher variable pay as a result of exceeding planned performance. 
 As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased 0.5 billion and 1.3 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.

 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased 2.3 billion or 8.0 and 7.5 billion or 9.1 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets led by strength in eCommerce and the shift in timing of Flipkart's BBD sales event. Net sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 were negatively affected by 1.2 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively, due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
 Gross profit rate decreased 85 and 4 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 were primarily driven by the shift in timing of Flipkart's BBD sales event and ongoing channel mix shifts, partially offset by growth in the majority of our other international markets and ongoing business mix changes. Additionally, for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the decrease in gross profit rate was also partially offset by improved eCommerce margins across certain markets. 
 Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 86 and 42 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 were primarily due to strong sales, including the shift in timing of Flipkart's BBD sales event, and format mix shifts primarily in China, partially offset by investments in associate wages in the Mexico and Central America and Canada markets. 
 As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased 0.1 billion and 0.6 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.

 (1) We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. 
 Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased 0.9 billion or 3.9 and 2.8 billion or 4.4 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 3.8 and 4.3 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, driven by growth in transactions and unit volumes, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.7 and 2.1 to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by club-fulfilled curbside pickup and delivery. 
 Gross profit rate increased 47 and 42 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 were primarily due to improved margins in fuel and lower markdowns as a result of disciplined inventory management, partially offset by eCommerce fulfillment costs. Additionally, lapping inflation-related LIFO charges in the prior year had a positive impact on gross profit rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2024. 
 Membership and other income increased 15.1 and 14.3 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to growth in the membership base and Plus penetration. Membership income also benefited from lapping a prior year promotional offering related to previous membership fee increases. 
 Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 63 and 36 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to increased compensation related expenses, including higher variable pay as a result of exceeding our planned performance. Additionally, elevated technology spend in the three months ended October 31, 2024 had a negative impact on operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
 As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased slightly for the three months ended October 31, 2024, and increased 0.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating income and lapping the payment of accrued opioid legal charges in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by increased inventory purchases. 
 Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 10.0 billion and 12.2 billion at October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our working capital deficit was 15.6 billion as of October 31, 2024, which was relatively consistent with our 15.8 billion working capital deficit as of October 31, 2023. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. 
 As of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents of 3.6 billion and 3.5 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash used in investing activities (12,661) (15,374) 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 12.7 billion as compared to 15.4 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 2.7 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 is primarily due to net proceeds received from sales of certain strategic investments, including 3.6 billion related to the sale of our JD.com investment, partially offset by an increase in payments for property and equipment. 
 Business acquisition 
 In December 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Vizio Holding Corp. for net cash consideration of approximately 2 billion, which will be classified as cash used in investing activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ending January 31, 2025. 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash used in financing activities (9,673) (179) 
 Net cash from financing activities generally consists of debt transactions, dividends paid, repurchases of Company stock and transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders. Net cash used in financing activities was 9.7 billion and 0.2 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 9.5 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 is primarily due to lower short-term borrowings in the current year, lapping debt issuances in the prior year comparable period, and increased share repurchases, partially offset by lapping the purchase of certain non-controlling interest in the prior year comparable period. 
 In April 2024, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of 10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of 5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of 15.0 billion at October 31, 2024, all undrawn. 
 Long-term Debt 
 The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2024: 
 (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2024 3,447 36,132 39,579 Repayments of long-term debt (2,817) (2,817) Reclassifications of long-term debt 2,625 (2,625) Other (9) 138 129 Balances as of October 31, 2024 3,246 33,645 36,891

Table of Contents 

 During the nine months ended October 31, 2024, our total outstanding long-term debt decreased 2.7 billion primarily due to maturities of certain long-term debt. Refer to Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the repayments of long-term debt. 
 Dividends 
 Effective February 20, 2024, the Company approved the fiscal 2025 annual dividend of 0.83 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2024 annual dividend of 0.76 per share. For fiscal 2025, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of 0.2075 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: 
 Record Date Payable Date March 15, 2024 April 1, 2024 May 10, 2024 May 28, 2024 August 16, 2024 September 3, 2024 December 13, 2024 January 6, 2025 
 The dividend installments payable on April 1, 2024, May 28, 2024 and September 3, 2024 were paid as scheduled. 
 Company Share Repurchase Program 
 From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the nine months ended October 31, 2024 were made under the current 20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of October 31, 2024, authorization for 13.5 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 
 We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023: Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2024 2023 Total number of shares repurchased 45.9 25.9 Average price paid per share 66.37 49.40 Total amount paid for share repurchases 3,049 1,282 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. 
 Capital Resources 
 We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. 
 We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of October 31, 2024, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: 
 Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. We are currently upgrading our financial system in stages, beginning in our U.S. and Canadian markets, including our general ledger which was upgraded for these markets during fiscal 2024. Our financial system is a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement other components of our new financial system in stages, and each implementation will impact our internal control over financial reporting. 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no significant change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

 II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: 
 Driver Platform Matters: The Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities regarding the independent contractor classification of drivers and payment and operational practices with respect to the Company's driver platform, as well as defending putative class and representative action civil litigation relating to driver classification and defending other civil litigation and arbitration claims in connection with the driver platform. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations by the governmental entities or the civil litigation and arbitration matters. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. 
 III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed 1 million. 
 In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc. On July 15, 2024, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the State of California pursuant to which the Company would pay 7.5 million and maintain current hazardous waste management practices and cause certain reports to be made for a period of four years. The Court approved the settlement and entered final judgment on October 24, 2024, and the settlement has been paid. 
 In October 2023, the Company received a Finding of Violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") alleging violations of the Clean Air Act in connection with the Company's refrigeration leak detection and repair program at certain of its facilities. The Company is evaluating the findings and cooperating with the EPA in its investigation. The EPA may seek to impose monetary and non-monetary penalties for the alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter. Although the Company does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption "Risk Factors," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.
