 No person who is an officer, director, or employee of the Adviser or its affiliates and who serves as a director of the Company receives any compensation from the Company for his or her services as a director. However, the Company reimburses the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates to the Company s Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business and affairs of the Company).

 Investment Advisory Agreement 
 The Company has entered into an amended and restated Investment Advisory Agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective on May 18, 2021. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for managing the Company s business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring its investments, and monitoring its portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. 
 The Adviser s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and accordingly, the Adviser may provide similar services to others. 
 Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect for from the date it first became effective, and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities and, in each case, by a majority of independent directors.

 of the Company s average gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts, at the end of the Company s two most recently completed calendar quarters. 
 Following the Exchange Listing, the management fee is payable at an annual rate of (x) of the Company s average gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) that is above an asset coverage ratio of calculated in accordance with Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act and (y) of the Company s average gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) that is below an asset coverage ratio of calculated in accordance with Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, in each case, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The management fee for any partial month or quarter, as the case may be, will be appropriately prorated and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant calendar months or quarters, as the case may be. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management fees were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, management fees were million and million, respectively. 
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser was not entitled to an incentive fee prior to the Exchange Listing. Following the Exchange Listing, the incentive fee consists of components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income and a portion is based on the Company s capital gains. The portion of the incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears commencing with the first calendar quarter following the Exchange Listing, and will equal of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of a quarterly hurdle rate, until the Adviser has received of the total pre-incentive fee net investment income for that calendar quarter and, for pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of quarterly, of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income for that calendar quarter. 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears, equals of cumulative realized capital gains from the date on which the Exchange Listing became effective (the Listing Date to the end of each calendar year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from the Listing Date to the end of each calendar year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for prior periods. The Company will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Company were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, including Section 205 thereof. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred million and million of performance based incentive fees based on net investment income, respectively. There were performance based incentive fees on net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not accrue capital gains based incentive fees. There were capital gains based incentive fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 The Company may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with its affiliates without prior approval of the directors who are not interested persons, and in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. The Company relies on an order for exemptive relief (as amended, the Order that has been granted to Blue Owl Credit Advisors LLC OCA and its affiliates to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain affiliates, in a manner consistent with the Company s investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as

 The Company typically determines the fair value of performing Level 3 debt investments utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to the expected life, portfolio company performance since close, and other terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to its total enterprise value, and the rights and remedies of the Company s investment within the portfolio company s capital structure. 
 When the debtor is not performing or when there is insufficient value to cover the investment, the Company may utilize a net recovery approach to determine the fair value of debt investments in subject companies. A net recovery analysis typically consists of two steps. First, the total enterprise value for the subject company is estimated using standard valuation approaches, most commonly the market approach. Second, the fair value for each investment in the subject company is then estimated by allocating the subject company's total enterprise value to the outstanding securities in the capital structure based upon various factors, including seniority, preferences, and other features if deemed relevant to each security in the capital structure. 
 Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 debt investments primarily include current market yields, including relevant market indices, but may also include quotes from brokers, dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable investments. For the Company s Level 3 equity investments, a market approach, based on comparable financial performance multiples such as publicly-traded company

 On January 12, 2024, the Board declared, in addition to the special dividend paid on June 14, 2024 and September 13, 2024, special dividends of per share, payable on or before December 13, 2024, March 14, 2025 and June 13, 2025 to shareholders of record as of November 29, 2024, February 28, 2025 and May 30, 2025.

 Dividend Reinvestment 
 With respect to distributions, the Company has adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. If newly issued shares are used to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, the number of shares to be issued to a shareholder will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable to a shareholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the payment date of a distribution, or if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and ask prices. However, if the market price per share on the payment date of a cash dividend or distribution exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share, we will issue shares at the greater of (i) the most recently computed net asset value per share and (ii) of the current market price per share (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeded the most recently computed net asset value per share). If shares are purchased in the open market to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, the number of shares to be issued to a shareholder shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the cash dividend payable to such shareholder by the weighted average price per share for all shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market in connection with the dividend Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.

 Overview 
 Blue Owl Capital Corporation III (the Company , we , us or our is a Maryland corporation formed on January 27, 2020. We were formed primarily to originate and make loans to, and make debt and equity investments in middle-market companies based primarily in the United States. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, equity and equity-related securities including warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company s common equity. Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. 
 We are managed by Blue Owl Diversified Credit Advisors LLC the Adviser or our Adviser ). The Adviser is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). The Adviser is an indirect affiliate of Blue Owl Capital Inc. Blue Owl (NYSE: OWL) and part of Blue Owl's Credit platform, which focuses on direct lending. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors the Board or our Board ), the Adviser manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory and management services to us. The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain origination activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees from portfolio companies. The Adviser is responsible for managing our business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring our investments, and monitoring our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. 
 Prior to the Exchange Listing (as defined below), we conducted private offerings (each, a Private Offering of our common shares to accredited investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On January 25, 2024, our common stock was listed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol OBDE (the Exchange Listing ). 
 Blue Owl consists of three investment platforms: (1) Credit, which focuses on direct lending, (2) GP Strategic Capital, which focuses on acquiring equity stakes in and providing debt financing to institutional alternative asset managers and (3) Real Estate, which focuses on triple net lease real estate strategies and real estate credit. Blue Owl's Credit platform is comprised of the Adviser, Blue Owl Credit Advisors LLC OCA ), Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors LLC OTCA ), Blue Owl Technology Credit Advisors II LLC OTCA II ), and Blue Owl Credit Private Fund Advisors LLC OPFA and together with the Adviser, OCA, OTCA and OTCA II, the Blue Owl Credit Advisers ), which are also investment advisers. As of September 30, 2024, the Adviser and its affiliates had 128.44 billion of assets under management across the Blue Owl Credit platform. 
 The management of our investment portfolio is the responsibility of the Adviser and the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. The Investment Team is also led by Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz and Craig W. Packer and is supported by certain members of the Adviser's senior executive team and Blue Owl's Credit platform's investment committees. Blue Owl's Credit platform has four investment committees each of which focuses on a specific investment strategy (Diversified Lending, Technology Lending, First Lien Lending and Opportunistic Lending). Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz, Craig W. Packer and Alexis Maged sit on each of Blue Owl's Credit platform's investment committees. The Investment Team, under the Diversified Lending Investment Committee's supervision, sources investment opportunities, conducts research, performs due diligence on potential investments, structures our investments and will monitor our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. In addition to Messrs. Ostrover, Lipschultz, Packer and Maged, the Diversified Lending Investment Committee is comprised of Patrick Linnemann, Meenal Mehta and Logan Nicholson. We consider the individuals on the Diversified Lending Investment Committee to be our portfolio managers. 
 117 

The Diversified Lending Investment Committee meets regularly to consider our investments, direct our strategic initiatives and supervise the actions taken by the Adviser on our behalf. In addition, the Diversified Lending Investment Committee reviews and determines whether to make prospective investments (including approving parameters or guidelines pursuant to which investments in broadly syndicated loans may be bought and sold), structures financings and monitors the performance of the investment portfolio. Each investment opportunity requires the approval of a majority of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. Follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies may require the Diversified Lending Investment Committee's approval beyond that obtained when the initial investment in the portfolio company was made. In addition, temporary investments, such as those in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, may require approval by the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. The compensation packages of certain Diversified Lending Investment Committee members from the Adviser include various combinations of discretionary bonuses and variable incentive compensation based primarily on performance for services provided and may include shares of Blue Owl. 
 We may be prohibited under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We rely on an order for exemptive relief (as amended, the Order ), that has been granted by the SEC to OCA and certain of its affiliates, to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain of its affiliates, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to the Order, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing, and (4) the proposed investment by us would not benefit our Adviser or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the Order and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. 
 In addition, the Order permits us to continue to co-invest in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company. 
 The Blue Owl Credit Advisers investment allocation policy seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities over time between us and/or other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates. As a result of the Order, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of the business development companies BDCs ), private funds and separately managed accounts managed by the Blue Owl Credit Advisers (collectively, the Blue Owl Credit Clients and/or of other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the Order and that have an investment objective similar to ours. 
 On April 24, 2020, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, OR Lending III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lenders license. OR Lending III LLC makes loans to borrowers headquartered in California. From time to time we may form wholly-owned subsidiaries to facilitate our normal course of business. 
 Certain consolidated subsidiaries of ours are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a regulated investment company RIC for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as: 
 the requirement to invest at least 70 of our assets in qualifying assets , as such term is defined in the 1940 Act; 
 source of income limitations; 
 asset diversification requirements; and 
 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least the sum of 90 of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year.

 118 

On August 7, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Blue Owl Capital Corporation, a Maryland corporation OBDC ), Cardinal Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of OBDC Merger Sub ), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, OCA, investment adviser to OBDC, and the Adviser. The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Mergers, Merger Sub will merge with and into us, with the Company continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of OBDC (the Initial Merger and, immediately thereafter, we will merge with and into OBDC, with OBDC continuing as the surviving company (together with the Initial Merger, the Mergers ).

Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States. 
 Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce the levels of certain investments through partial sales or syndication to additional lenders. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to ten years. As of September 30, 2024, 97.3 of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors, in certain cases. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable either monthly or quarterly. 
 Our investment portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and any alternative reference rates may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments vary in size, our results in any given period, including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period, often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business or macro trends. Generally, because our portfolio consists primarily of floating rate loans, we expect our earnings to benefit from a prolonged higher rate environment. 
 Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP as interest income using the effective yield method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring, or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and possibly consulting fees. Certain of these fees may be capitalized and amortized as additional interest income over the life of the related loan. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded companies. 
 Our portfolio activity will also reflect the proceeds from sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair 
 120 

value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating expenses. The management fee compensates our Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing, monitoring and realizing our investments. The Adviser was not entitled to an incentive fee prior to the Exchange Listing. 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by the Adviser. In addition, the Adviser shall be solely responsible for any placement or finder s fees payable to placement agents engaged by us or our affiliates in connection with the offering of securities by us. We bear our allocable portion of the costs of the compensation, benefits and related administrative expenses (including travel expenses) of our officers who provide operational and administrative services hereunder, their respective staffs and other professionals who provide services to us (including, in each case, employees of the Adviser or an affiliate) who assist with the preparation, coordination, and administration of the foregoing or provide other back office or middle office financial or operational services to us. We shall reimburse the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to such individuals (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business affairs and in acting on our behalf). We also will bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to (i) investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; (ii) our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its administrative obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement; and (iii) all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions including, without limitation, those relating to: 
 the cost of our organization and any offerings; 
 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; 
 the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of our common stock and other securities; 
 fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any; 
 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; 
 costs of hedging; 
 expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the investment team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; 
 escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses; 
 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 
 federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; 
 federal, state and local taxes; 
 independent directors fees and expenses including certain travel expenses; 
 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration fees, listing fees and licenses, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing; 
 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; 
 121 

commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 
 research and market data; 
 fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 
 direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; 
 fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; 
 costs of winding up; 
 costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold our assets for tax or other purposes; 
 extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and 
 costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. 
 We expect, but cannot ensure, that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms during periods of asset growth, but will decline as a percentage of total assets during such periods. 
 Leverage 
 The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions. On June 4, 2020, we received shareholder approval that allows us to reduce our asset coverage ratio from 200 to 150 , effective as of June 5, 2020. As a result, we are generally permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to the common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would at least be equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. This reduced asset coverage ratio permits us to double the amount of leverage we can incur. For example, under a 150 asset coverage ratio we may borrow 2 for investment purposes of every 1 of investor equity whereas under a 200 asset coverage ratio we may only borrow 1 for investment purposes for every 1 of investor equity. Our current target leverage ratio is 0.90x-1.25x debt-to-equity. As of September 30, 2024, we had net leverage of 1.21x debt-to-equity. 
 In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our leverage over time subject to the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets to financing facilities. 
 Market Trends 
 We believe the middle-market lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Limited Availability of Capital for Middle-Market Companies. The middle-market is a large addressable market. According to GE Capital s National Center for the Middle Market Mid-Year 2024 Middle Market Indicator, there are approximately 200,000 U.S. middle-market companies, which have approximately 48 million aggregate employees. Moreover, the U.S. middle-market accounts for one-third of private sector gross domestic product GDP ). GE defines U.S. middle-market companies as those between 10 million and 1 billion in annual revenue, which we believe has significant overlap with our definition of U.S. middle-market companies. We believe U.S. middle-market companies will continue to require access to debt capital to refinance existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions. We believe that regulatory and structural factors, industry consolidation and general risk aversion limit the amount of traditional financing available to U.S. middle-market companies. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans and high yield securities for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We also believe that there is a lack of market participants that are willing to hold meaningful amounts of certain middle-market loans. As a result, we believe our ability to minimize syndication risk for a company seeking financing by being able to hold its loans without having to syndicate them, coupled with reduced capacity of traditional lenders to serve the middle-market, present an attractive opportunity to invest in middle-market companies. 
 Capital Markets Have Been Unable to Fill the Void in U.S. Middle-Market Finance Left by Banks . Access to underwritten bond and syndicated loan markets is challenging for middle-market companies due to loan issue size and 
 122 

liquidity. For example, high yield bonds are generally purchased by institutional investors, such as mutual funds and exchange traded funds ETFs who, among other things, are focused on the liquidity characteristics of the bond being issued in order to fund investor redemptions and/or comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the existence of an active secondary market for bonds is an important consideration in these entities initial investment decision. 
 Syndicated loans arranged through a bank are done either on a best efforts basis or are underwritten with terms plus provisions that permit the underwriters to change certain terms, including pricing, structure, yield and tenor, otherwise known as flex , to successfully syndicate the loan, in the event the terms initially marketed are insufficiently attractive to investors. Furthermore, banks are generally reluctant to underwrite middle-market loans because the arrangement fees they may earn on the placement of the debt generally are not sufficient to meet the banks return hurdles. Loans provided by companies such as ours provide certainty to issuers in that we have a more stable capital base and have the ability to invest in illiquid assets, and we can commit to a given amount of debt on specific terms, at stated coupons and with agreed upon fees. As we are the ultimate holder of the loans, we do not require market flex or other arrangements that banks may require when acting on an agency basis. In addition, our Adviser has teams focused on both liquid credit and private credit and these teams are able to collaborate with respect to syndicated loans. 
 Secular Trends Supporting Growth for Private Credit. We believe that periods of market volatility, such as the current period of market volatility caused, in part, by uncertainty regarding inflation and interest rates, and current geopolitical conditions have accentuated the advantages of private credit. The availability of capital in the liquid credit market is highly sensitive to market conditions whereas we believe private lending has proven to be a stable and reliable source of capital through periods of volatility. We believe the opportunity set for private credit will continue to expand even as the public loan markets remain open. Financial sponsors and companies today are familiar with direct lending and have seen firsthand the strong value proposition that a private solution can offer. Scale, certainty of execution and flexibility all provide borrowers with a compelling alternative to the syndicated and high yield markets. Based on our experience, there is an emerging trend where higher quality credits that have traditionally been issuers in the syndicated and high yield markets are increasingly seeking private solutions independent of credit market conditions. In our view, this is supported by financial sponsors wanting to work with collaborative financing partners that have scale and breadth of capabilities. We believe the large amount of uninvested capital held by funds of private equity firms broadly, estimated by Preqin Ltd., an alternative assets industry data and research company, to be 2.7 trillion as of December 31, 2023, will continue to drive deal activity. We expect that private equity sponsors will continue to pursue acquisitions and leverage their equity investments with secured loans provided by companies such as us. 
 Attractive Investment Dynamics. An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics. We believe the directly negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides more favorable terms to the lender, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection, and lender-protective change of control provisions. Additionally, we believe BDC managers expertise in credit selection and ability to manage through credit cycles has generally resulted in BDCs experiencing lower loss rates than U.S. commercial banks through credit cycles. Further, we believe that historical middle-market default rates have been lower, and recovery rates have been higher, as compared to the larger market capitalization, broadly distributed market, leading to lower cumulative losses. Lastly, we believe that in the current environment, lenders with available capital may be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and may be able to achieve improved economic spreads and documentation terms. 
 Conservative Capital Structures. Following the global credit crisis, which we define broadly as occurring between mid-2007 and mid-2009, lenders have generally required borrowers to maintain more equity as a percentage of their total capitalization, specifically to protect lenders during economic downturns. With more conservative capital structures, U.S. middle-market companies have exhibited higher levels of cash flows available to service their debt. In addition, U.S. middle-market companies often are characterized by simpler capital structures than larger borrowers, which facilitates a streamlined underwriting process and, when necessary, restructuring process. 
 Attractive Opportunities in Investments in Loans. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, equity and equity-related securities. We believe that opportunities in senior secured loans are significant because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and because of the strong defensive characteristics of these types of investments. We believe that debt issues with floating interest rates offer a superior return profile as compared with fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Senior secured debt has priority in payment among an issuer s security holders whereby holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders. Further, these investments are secured by the issuer s assets, which may provide protection in the event of a default.

Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 As of September 30, 2024, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 84.9 first lien senior secured debt investments (of which 51.4 we consider to be unitranche debt investments (including last out portions of such loans)), 5.2 second lien senior secured debt investments, 1.6 unsecured debt investments, 3.3 preferred equity investments, 4.9 common equity investments and 0.1 joint ventures. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average total yield of the portfolio at fair value and amortized cost was 10.8 and 10.8 , respectively, and our weighted average yield of accruing debt and income producing securities at fair value and amortized cost was 11.1 and 11.1 , respectively (1) . As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average spread of total debt investments was 5.9 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had investments in 185 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of 4.25 billion. 
 In the current lending environment, public loan markets have remained active while merger and acquisition activity remains below historical levels; however, our platform continues to find attractive investment opportunities for deployment, predominantly in first lien originations. In addition, a large portion of our originations across the platform this quarter were deployed into existing borrowers as part of add-on transactions. 
 The credit quality of our portfolio has been consistent. We continue to focus on investing in industries we view as recession resistant and that we are familiar with, including service-oriented sectors such as software and healthcare, all of which serve diversified and durable end markets, and on additional financings to our existing borrowers. Blue Owl serves as the administrative agent on many of our investments and the majority of our investments are supported by sophisticated financial sponsors who provide operational and financial resources. Our borrowers have a weighted average EBITDA of 217.4 million and we believe this scale contributes to the durability of our borrowers and their ability to adapt to different economic environments. In addition, Blue Owl continues to invest in, and is often the lead lender or administrative agent on, transactions in excess of 1 billion in size, which gives us the ability to structure the terms of such deals to maximize deal economics and credit protection. 
 Many of the companies in which we invest are continuing to see modest growth in both revenues and EBITDA. However, in the event of further geopolitical, economic and financial market instability, in the U.S. and elsewhere, it is possible that the results of some of the middle-market companies similar to those in which we invest could be challenged. While we are not seeing signs of an overall, broad deterioration in our results or those of our portfolio companies at this time, there can be no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our future results. 
 We also continue to invest in Credit SLF and specialty financing portfolio companies, including Fifth Season Investments LLC Fifth Season ), LSI Financing 1 DAC LSI Financing ), and AAM Series 1.1 Rail and Domestic Intermodal Feeder, LLC and AAM Series 2.1 Aviation Feeder, LLC (collectively, Amergin AssetCo ). In the future we may invest through additional specialty finance portfolio companies, joint ventures, partnerships or other special purpose vehicles. These companies may use our capital to support acquisitions which could lead to increased dividend income across well-diversified underlying portfolios. See Specialty Financing Portfolio Companies .

 (1) For non-stated rate income producing investments, computed based on (a) the dividend or interest income earned for the respective trailing twelve months ended on the measurement date, divided by (b) the ending fair value. In instances where historical dividend or interest income data is not available or not representative for the trailing twelve months ended, the dividend or interest income is annualized. 
 The weighted average yield of our debt and income producing securities is not the same as a return on investment for our shareholders but, rather, relates to our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount and loan origination fees, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. 
 Our Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 
 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 
 comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company s industry; and 
 review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 
 An investment will be placed on the Adviser's credit watch list when select events occur and will only be removed from the watch list with oversight of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee and/or other Blue Owl agent. Once an investment is on the credit watch list, the Adviser works with the borrower to resolve any financial stress through amendments, waivers or other alternatives. If a borrower defaults on its payment obligations, the Adviser's focus shifts to capital recovery. If an investment needs to be restructured, the Adviser s workout team partners with the investment team 
 128 

and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the approval of a majority of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 
 Investment Rating Description 1 Investments rated 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable; 
 2 Investments rated 2 involve an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The borrower is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2; 
 3 Investments rated 3 involve a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition; 
 4 Investments rated 4 involve a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased materially since origination or acquisition. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 120 days past due); and 
 5 Investments rated 5 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 
 Our Adviser rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated 3, 4 or 5, our Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 
 The Adviser has built out its portfolio management team to include workout experts who closely monitor our portfolio companies and who, on at least a quarterly basis, assess each portfolio company s operational and liquidity exposure and outlook to understand and mitigate risks; and, on at least a monthly basis, evaluates existing and newly identified situations where operating results are deviating from expectations. As part of its monitoring process, the Adviser focuses on projected liquidity needs and where warranted, re-underwriting credits and evaluating downside and liquidation scenarios. 
 The Adviser focuses on downside protection by leveraging existing rights available under our credit documents; however, for investments that are significantly underperforming or which may need to be restructured, the Adviser s workout team partners with the Investment Team and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the 
 129 

approval of a majority of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee. As of September 30, 2024, one of our portfolio companies is on non-accrual. Our average annual gain/loss ratio is (0.11) . 
 The table below presents the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of the following periods: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Investment Rating Investments at Fair Value Percentage of Total Portfolio Investments at Fair Value Percentage of Total Portfolio in thousands) 1 417,343 9.8 442,688 12.3 2 3,594,253 84.5 2,960,620 82.5 3 214,651 5.1 167,834 4.7 4 16,449 0.4 5 6,379 0.2 19,559 0.5 Total 4,249,075 100.0 3,590,701 100.0 
 The table below presents the amortized cost of our performing and non-accrual debt investments as of the following periods: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 in thousands) Amortized Cost Percentage Amortized Cost Percentage Performing 3,887,512 99.7 3,218,317 99.4 Non-accrual 12,199 0.3 20,121 0.6 Total 3,899,711 100.0 3,238,438 100.0 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

 Results of Operations 
 The table below represents the operating results for the following periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total Investment Income 129.0 107.2 365.7 311.3 Less: Operating expenses 79.2 37.9 216.6 109.4 Net Investment Income (Loss) Before Taxes 49.8 69.3 149.1 201.9 Less: Income taxes (benefit), including excise taxes (0.7) 0.2 1.6 Net Investment Income (Loss) After Taxes 50.5 69.1 149.1 200.3 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) 0.1 4.2 (0.7) 28.0 Net realized gain (loss) (8.4) 0.2 (12.6) (11.3) Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 42.2 73.5 135.8 217.0 
 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our net asset value per share decreased, primarily driven by decreases in the fair value of certain debt investments. 
 131 

Investment Income 
 The table below presents the composition of investment income for the following periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest income (excluding PIK interest income) 110.5 89.9 310.8 253.9 PIK interest income 10.8 10.4 31.7 35.2 Dividend income 6.1 5.4 18.8 17.3 Other income 1.6 1.5 4.4 4.9 Total investment income 129.0 107.2 365.7 311.3 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Investment income increased by 21.8 million to 129.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 107.2 million for the same period in prior year primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of an increase in our debt investment portfolio which, at par, increased from 3.28 billion as of September 30, 2023, to 3.95 billion as of September 30, 2024. Included in interest income are other fees such as prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns which are non-recurring in nature. Period over period, these fees increased due to an increase in repayment activity for the period. Payment-in-kind interest and dividend income represented approximately 8.4 and 2.6 , respectively, of investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 9.7 and 3.7 , respectively, of investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations and repayments. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Investment income increased by 54.4 million to 365.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 311.3 million for the same period in prior year primarily due to an increase in interest income as a result of an increase in our debt investment portfolio which, at par, increased from 3.28 billion as of September 30, 2023, to 3.95 billion as of September 30, 2024. Included in interest income are other fees such as prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns which are non-recurring in nature. Period over period, these fees increased due to an increase in repayment activity for the period. Payment-in-kind interest and dividend income represented approximately 8.7 and 3.0 , respectively, of investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 11.3 and 4.1 , respectively, of investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect that investment income will vary based on a variety of factors including the pace of our originations and repayments.

Expenses 
 The table below presents expenses for the following periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest expense 48.5 31.1 127.0 89.4 Management fee 15.8 4.5 43.2 13.3 Performance based incentive fees 10.7 28.5 Professional fees 2.5 1.2 5.7 3.8 Directors' fees 0.2 0.3 0.7 0.7 Listing advisory fees 6.0 Other general and administrative 1.5 0.8 5.5 2.2 Total operating expenses 79.2 37.9 216.6 109.4 
 Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, we reimburse the Adviser for services performed for us. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we reimburse the Adviser for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total expenses increased by 41.3 million to 79.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 37.9 million for the same period in prior year primarily due to an increase in management fees, incentive fees and interest expense of 11.3 million, 10.7 million and 17.4 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense was driven by an increase in average daily borrowings to 2.58 billion from 1.71 billion period over period, as well as an increase in the average interest rate to 7.1 from 6.8 period over period. Management fees increased due to an increase in our investment portfolio, which at fair value, increased from 3.57 billion as of September 30, 2023 to 4.25 billion as of September 30, 2024, as well as the increased fee rates effective as of our listing date, January 25, 2024. Incentive fees were not incurred prior to the Exchange Listing. As a percentage of total assets, professional fees, directors fees and other general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent period over period. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Total expenses increased by 107.2 million to 216.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 109.4 million for the same period in prior year due to an increase in management fees, incentive fees, interest expense and other expenses of 29.9 million, 28.5 million, 37.6 million and 11.2 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense was driven by an increase in average daily borrowings to 2.26 billion from 1.71 billion period over period, as well as an increase in the average interest rate to 7.1 from 6.6 period over period. Management fees increased due to an increase in our investment portfolio, which at fair value, increased from 3.57 billion as of September 30, 2023 to 4.25 billion as of September 30, 2024, as well as the increased fee rates effective as of our listing date, January 25, 2024. Incentive fees were not incurred prior to the Exchange Listing and are pro-rated for the period ending September 30, 2024. The increase in other expenses was primarily driven by expenses associated with the Exchange Listing, including 6.0 million of listing advisory fees paid to external parties advising on our exchange listing, which are not anticipated to be recurring in nature. As a percentage of total assets, professional fees, directors fees and other general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent period over period. 
 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. In addition, a RIC may, in certain cases, satisfy this distribution requirement by distributing dividends relating to a taxable year after the close of such taxable year under the spillover dividend provisions of Subchapter M. As of September 30, 2024, we have generated undistributed taxable earnings spillover of 0.41 per share. The undistributed taxable earnings spillover will be carried forward toward distributions to be paid in accordance with RIC requirements. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other 
 133 

things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieves us from U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a reversal of U.S. federal excise tax of 0.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a reversal of U.S. federal excise tax of 16.2 thousand. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we accrued U.S federal excise tax of 0.2 million and 1.6 million, respectively. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) 
 We fair value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses. The table below presents the composition of net change in unrealized gains (losses) for the following periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments 4.4 (1.1) 28.0 Net change in translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies 0.3 (0.2) 0.6 Income tax (provision) benefit (0.2) (0.2) Net change in unrealized gain (loss) 0.1 4.2 (0.7) 28.0 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net change in unrealized gain (loss) was primarily driven by decreases in the fair value of certain debt investments, offset by a reversal of a prior period unrealized loss that was realized during the period in connection with the restructuring of a debt investment and increases in the fair value of certain equity investments. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal was 98.6 , as compared to 98.7 as of June 30, 2024.

The ten largest contributors to the change in net unrealized gain (loss) on investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of the following:

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net change in unrealized gain (loss) was primarily driven by an increase in the fair value of our debt investments as compared to December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of principal was 98.6 , as compared to 97.7 as of December 31, 2022. The primary drivers of our portfolio's unrealized gain was due to current market conditions, including credit spreads tightening across the broader markets, increase in fair value of certain equity investments, and the reversal of a prior period unrealized loss that was realized during the period in connection with the restructuring of a debt investment.

Net Realized Gains (Losses) 
 The table below presents the composition of realized gains and losses on fully exited portfolio companies, partially exited portfolio companies and foreign currency transactions for the following periods:

 Realized Gross Internal Rate of Return 
 Since we began investing in 2020 through September 30, 2024, our exited investments have resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized gross internal rate of return to us of 11.4 (based on total capital invested of 1.97 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of 2.33 billion). 
 IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited. 
 Capital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. 
 Realized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees (except upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of an investment), administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. 
 Gross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our shareholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero. 
 Gross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of management fees, expenses, incentive fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our shareholders, and would be lower if it did. 
 Aggregate cash flow realized gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments, our credit facilities, and other secured and unsecured debt. The primary uses of our cash are (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying or reimbursing our Adviser), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of any borrowings and (iv) cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 We may from time to time enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities, enter into additional debt securitization transactions or issue additional debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . In addition, from time to time, we may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange debt securities in open market purchases or by other means, including privately negotiated transactions, in each case dependent on market conditions, liquidity, contractual obligations, 
 137 

and other matters. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 176 . We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage limitation to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund. 
 Cash as of September 30, 2024, taken together with our available debt capacity of 367.6 million, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. Our long-term cash needs will include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and funding of additional portfolio investments. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from unused net proceeds from financing activities. We believe that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy our short and long-term cash requirements. We cannot, however, be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to us in sufficient amounts in the future. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 151.3 million in cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 517.5 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of 1.90 billion, partially offset by sales and repayments of 1.28 billion and other operating activity of 92.7 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was 527.4 million during the period, which was the result of proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facilities, net of debt issuance costs, of 681.2 million, partially offset by distributions paid of 153.8 million. 
 Equity 
 Exchange Listing, Subscriptions and Drawdowns 
 In connection with our formation, we have the authority to issue 500,000,000 common shares at 0.01 per share par value. 
 On January 25, 2024, our common stock was listed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol OBDE (the Exchange Listing ). 
 On June 4, 2020, the Company issued 100 common shares for 1,500 to the Adviser. 
 We have entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements with investors providing for the private placement of our common shares. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors were required to fund drawdowns to purchase our common shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we delivered a drawdown notice to our investors. As of June 16, 2022, all Capital Commitments had been drawn. 
 There were no sales of the Company s common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 In connection with the Exchange Listing, the Board of Directors determined to eliminate outstanding fractional shares of the Company s common stock, as permitted by Maryland General Corporation Law. On January 16, 2024, the Company eliminated the fractional shares by rounding up the number of fractional shares held by each shareholder to the nearest whole share. 
 Following the Exchange Listing, without prior written consent of our Board: 
 For 180 days, a shareholder is not permitted to transfer (whether by sale, gift, merger, by operation of law or otherwise), exchange, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber any shares of our common stock held by such shareholder prior to the date of the Exchange Listing (the First Lock-Up Period 
 For 270 days, a shareholder is not permitted to transfer (whether by sale, gift, merger, by operation of law or otherwise), exchange, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber two-thirds of the shares of our common stock held by such shareholder prior to the date of the Exchange Listing (the Second Lock-Up Period and 
 For 365 days, a shareholder is not permitted to transfer (whether by sale, gift, merger, by operation of law or otherwise), exchange, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber one-third of the shares of our common stock held by such shareholder prior to the date of the Exchange Listing (the Third Lock-Up Period ). 
 In connection with the Exchange Listing, a pro rata portion of each shareholder s shares of our common stock that was outstanding prior to the Exchange Listing was released from each of the First, Second and Third Lock-Up Periods. On May 29, 2024, the Board of Directors waived the transfer restrictions with respect to 19,491,245 shares of our common 
 138 

stock, effective June 5, 2024, and as a result, approximately half of each shareholder s shares that would otherwise become freely tradeable upon expiration of the First Lock-Up Period became freely tradeable on June 5, 2024. On July 23, 2024, the First Lock-Up Period expired and on October 18, 2024, the Second Lock-Up Period expired. Generally, all of our common stock that has been outstanding for more than six months are eligible for public sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act; however, certain affiliates will have to comply with the additional requirements relating to the manner of sale, volume limitation and notice provisions in order to rely on Rule 144. 
 If the Mergers are consummated before January 24, 2025, any portion of the Company's Common Stock outstanding prior to the Mergers subject to transfer restrictions (or lock-ups will have the transfer restrictions waived immediately prior to the Effective Time. 
 
 Distributions 
 The following table reflects the distributions declared on shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 September 30, 2024 Date Declared Record Date Payment Date Distribution per Share August 6, 2024 September 30, 2024 October 15, 2024 0.35 January 12, 2024 (special dividend) August 30, 2024 September 13, 2024 0.06 May 7, 2024 June 28, 2024 July 15, 2024 0.35 January 12, 2024 (special dividend) May 31, 2024 June 14, 2024 0.06 January 12, 2024 March 29, 2024 April 15, 2024 0.35 
 On January 12, 2024, the Board declared, in addition to the 0.06 special dividend paid on June 14, 2024 and September 13, 2024, three special dividends of 0.06 per share, payable on or before December 13, 2024, March 14, 2025 and June 13, 2025 to shareholders of record as of November 29, 2024, February 28, 2025 and May 30, 2025. 
 The following table reflects the distributions declared on shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 September 30, 2023 Date Declared Record Date Payment Date Distribution per Share August 8, 2023 September 30, 2023 November 15, 2023 0.48 May 9, 2023 June 30, 2023 August 15, 2023 0.48 February 21, 2023 March 31, 2023 May 15, 2023 0.44 
 During certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a shareholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities. Each year, a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the tax character of the distributions will be mailed to our shareholders. The tax character of the distributions are not determined until our taxable year end. 
 Dividend Reinvestment 
 With respect to distributions, we adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. 
 Prior to the Exchange Listing, the number of shares to be issued to a shareholder under the dividend reinvestment plan was determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such shareholder by the net asset value per share of our common stock, as of the last day of our calendar quarter immediately preceding the date such distribution was declared. 
 139 

In connection with the Exchange Listing, we entered into our amended and restated dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which, if newly issued shares are used to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, the number of shares to be issued to a shareholder will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable to a shareholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the payment date of a distribution, or if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and ask prices. However, if the market price per share on the payment date of a cash dividend or distribution exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share, we will issue shares at the greater of (i) the most recently computed net asset value per share and (ii) 95 of the current market price per share (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeded the most recently computed net asset value per share). For example, if the most recently computed net asset value per share is 15.00 and the market price on the payment date of a cash dividend is 14.00 per share, we will issue shares at 14.00 per share. If the most recently computed net asset value per share is 15.00 and the market price on the payment date of a cash dividend is 16.00 per share, we will issue shares at 15.20 per share (95 of the current market price). If the most recently computed net asset value per share is 15.00 and the market price on the payment date of a cash dividend is 15.50 per share, we will issue shares at 15.00 per share, as net asset value is greater than 95 14.73 per share) of the current market price. Pursuant to our amended and restated dividend reinvestment plan, if shares are purchased in the open market to implement the dividend reinvestment plan, the number of shares to be issued to a shareholder shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the cash dividend payable to such shareholder by the weighted average price per share for all shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market in connection with the dividend. 
 Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 The following table reflects the common stock issued pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 Repurchase Program 
 In connection with the Exchange Listing, the Board approved a repurchase program (the Repurchase Program under which we may repurchase up to 100 million of shares of our outstanding common stock. Under the Repurchase Program, purchases may be made at management s discretion from time to time in open-market transactions, in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. Unless extended by the Board, the Repurchase Program will terminate 12-months from the date of the Exchange Listing.

 On August 7, 2024, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement. Refer to Note 12. Pending Merger with Blue Owl Capital Corporation for a discussion of the Merger. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Investments at Fair Value 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period. 
 Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5, the Board designated the Adviser as the Company's valuation designee to perform fair value determinations relating to the value of assets held by the Company for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at the average bid price of those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, as the valuation designee, based on, among other things, the input of the independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of our Adviser. 
 As part of the valuation process, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including: the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (i.e., the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. 
 161 

Our Adviser, as the valuation designee, undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are readily available, those investments will typically be valued at the average bid price of those market quotations; 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the valuation process begins with the independent valuation firm(s) providing a preliminary valuation of each investment to the Adviser s valuation committee; 
 Preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with the Adviser s valuation committee; 
 Our Adviser, as the valuation designee, reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; 
 Each quarter, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, provides the Audit Committee a summary or description of material fair value matters that occurred in the prior quarter and on an annual basis, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, will provide the Audit Committee with a written assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of its fair value process; and 
 The Audit Committee oversees the valuation designee and will report to the Board on any valuation matters requiring the Board s attention. 
 We conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis. 
 We apply ASC 820, as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider its principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below: 
 Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. 
 Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfer occurred. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, evaluates the source of the inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When an investment is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), our Adviser, as the valuation designee, subjects those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, our Adviser, as the valuation designee, or the independent valuation firm(s) review pricing support provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. 
 The Company applies the practical expedient provided by the ASC Topic 820 relating to investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). ASC Topic 820 permits an entity holding investments in certain entities that either are investment companies, or have attributes similar to an investment company, and calculate NAV per share or its equivalent for which the fair value is not readily determinable, to measure the fair value of such investments on the basis of that NAV per share, or its equivalent, without adjustment. Investments which are valued using NAV per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy as per ASC Topic 820. 
 162 

Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein. 
 Financial and Derivative Instruments 
 Rule 18f-4 requires BDCs that use derivatives to, among other things, comply with a value-at-risk leverage limit, adopt a derivatives risk management program, and implement certain testing and board reporting procedures. Rule 18f-4 exempts BDCs that qualify as limited derivatives users from the aforementioned requirements, provided that these BDCs adopt written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage the BDC s derivatives risks and comply with certain recordkeeping requirements. Rule 18f-4 provides that a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Pursuant to Rule 18f-4, when we trade reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, we need to aggregate the amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness (e.g., bank borrowings, if applicable) when calculating our asset coverage ratio. The Company does not currently use derivatives and, as a result, qualifies as a limited derivatives user and expects to continue to do so. The Company has adopted a derivatives policy and complies with the recordkeeping requirements of Rule 18f-4. 
 Interest and Dividend Income Recognition 
 Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and includes amortization and accretion of premiums or discounts. Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind PIK interest or dividends, the majority of which is structured at initial underwriting. PIK interest or dividends represent accrued interest or dividends that are added to the principal amount of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or at the occurrence of a liquidation event. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period. 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. If at any point we believe PIK interest is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK interest will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest income. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies.

Distributions 
 We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To obtain and maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we must distribute (or be deemed to distribute) in each taxable year distribution for tax purposes equal to at least the sum of: 
 90 of our investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and 
 90 of our net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. 
 As a RIC, we (but not our shareholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders. 
 We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates. We can be expected to carry forward our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax as described below. 
 Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. We may be subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax if we do not distribute (or are treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; 
 98.2 of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and 
 100 of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. 
 While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4 U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed and as a result, in such cases, the excise tax will be imposed. In such an event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 We intend to pay quarterly distributions to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our tax treatment as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. 
 To the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our shareholders may be the original capital invested by the shareholder rather than our income or gains. Shareholders should read written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. 
 We have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common shareholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2020 and intend to continue to qualify annually thereafter as a RIC. So long as we maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we generally will not pay U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our shareholders as distributions. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our investors and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
 164 

To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we generally must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment company taxable income for that year, which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses. In order for us to not be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4 nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income. 
 Certain consolidated subsidiaries or ours are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. 
 We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. There were no material uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2023. As applicable, our prior three tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 SPV Asset Facility II Amendment 
 On October 10, 2024, ORCC III Financing II and we entered into the Amendment No. 2 (the Amendment ), which amended that certain loan financing and servicing agreement, dated as of December 2, 2021, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of February 18, 2022, by and among ORCC III Financing II, as borrower, us, as equityholder and services provider, the lenders from time to time parties thereto, Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as facility agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company, as collateral agent and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as collateral custodian. Among other changes, the Amendment: (i) replaced Alter Domus (US) LLC with State Street Bank and Trust Company as collateral custodian, (ii) increased the facility amount from 350.0 million to 500.0 million, (iii) extended the Revolving Period to December 2, 2027 and the Facility Termination Date to December 2, 2029, (vi) added the ability to draw in CAD, Euro and GBP and (vii) amended the reduction fee schedule and certain facility fees and expenses. 
 Distributions Declared 
 On November 5, 2024, the Board declared a third quarter 2024 regular dividend of 0.35 per share, payable on or before January 15, 2025 to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, credit risk and inflation risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, as our valuation designee, based on, among other things, the input of the independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Adviser, as our valuation designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected 
 165 

by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 In a low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase thereby increasing our net income as indicated per the table below. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 97.3 of our debt investments based on fair value were at floating rates. Additionally, the weighted average floor, based on fair value, of our debt investments was 0.8 . The Revolving Credit Facility, SPV Asset Facility I, SPV Asset Facility II, SPV Asset Facility III, and CLO XIV bear interest at variable interest rates with interest rate floors of 0.0 . The 2027 Notes, July 2025 Notes, July 2027 Notes and Series 2023A Notes bear interest at a fixed rate. 
 Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our debt investments (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments) assuming each floating rate investment is subject to a 3-month reference rate election and there are no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 in thousands) Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income (1) 
 Up 300 basis points 114,760 49,517 65,243 Up 200 basis points 76,507 33,012 43,495 Up 100 basis points 38,253 16,506 21,747 Down 100 basis points (38,253) (16,506) (21,747) Down 200 basis points (76,507) (33,012) (43,495) Down 300 basis points (114,760) (49,517) (65,243) 
 ________________ 
 (1) Excludes the impact of income based fees. See ITEM 1. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 3. Agreements and Related Party Transactions of our consolidated financial statements for more information on the income based fees. 
 We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options, and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates. 
 Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency, borrow in certain foreign currencies under our credit facilities or issue notes in certain foreign currencies. These investments, borrowings and issuances are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts or cross currency swaps to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. Instead of entering into a foreign currency forward contract in connection with loans or other investments denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan, issuance or investment. To the extent the loan, issuance or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our credit facilities, we may utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate. 
 Credit Risk 
 We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting to reputable financial institutions the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held the majority of our cash balances with a single highly rated money center bank and such balances are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. We seek to mitigate this exposure by monitoring the credit standing of these financial institutions. 
 166 

Inflation Risk 
 Inflation is likely to continue in the near to medium-term, particularly in the United States, with the possibility that monetary policy may continue to tighten in response. Persistent inflationary pressures could affect our portfolio companies' profit margins. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 167 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Neither we nor the Adviser are currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of any such future legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that any such future proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in Part II, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Other than the shares issued pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan, we did not sell any unregistered equity securities, except as previously disclosed in certain 8-Ks filed with the SEC. 
 In the third quarter 2024, pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan, we purchased 296,755 shares of our common stock in the open market, at a weighted average price of 14.97 per share, for distribution to stockholders of record as of June 28, 2024 and August 30, 2024 for the second quarter dividend and special third quarter dividend, respectively, that did not opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan in order to satisfy the reinvestment portion of our dividends. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company s directors or executive officers or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. 
 Appointment of Officer 
 On November 5, 2024, our Board appointed Jonathan Lamm, our Chief Financial Officer, to serve as our Chief Operating Officer effective as of November 11, 2024. Mr. Lamm will continue in his role as Chief Financial Officer. The role of Chief Operating Officer was previously held by Bryan Cole who serves as the Head of Operations for Blue Owl Capital Inc., an affiliate of our Adviser.
