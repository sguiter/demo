 In the first quarter of 2024, we issued our annual share-based compensation grants under the Pentair plc 2020 Share and Incentive Plan to eligible employees. The total number of awards issued was approximately million, of which million were restricted stock units RSUs ), million were stock options and million were performance share units PSUs ). The weighted-average grant date fair value of the RSUs, stock options and PSUs issued was , and , respectively. 
 Expected dividend yield Expected share price volatility Expected term (years) 
 These estimates require us to make assumptions based on historical results, observance of trends in our share price, changes in option exercise behavior, future expectations and other relevant factors. If other assumptions had been used, share-based compensation expense, as calculated and recorded under the accounting guidance, could have been affected. We based the expected life assumption on historical experience as well as the terms and vesting periods of the options granted. For purposes of determining expected share price volatility, we considered a rolling average of historical volatility measured over a period approximately equal to the expected option term. The risk-free interest rate for periods that coincide with the expected life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury Department yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

 Pentair, Pentair Finance S. r.l PFSA and Pentair, Inc. are parties to a credit agreement (the Senior Credit Facility ), with Pentair as guarantor and PFSA and Pentair, Inc. as borrowers, providing for a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. During the second quarter of 2024, PFSA repaid million of term loans under the Senior Credit Facility. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of December 16, 2026. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate, adjusted term secured overnight financing rate, adjusted euro interbank offered rate, adjusted daily simple secured overnight financing rate or central bank rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on, at PFSA s election, Pentair s leverage level or PFSA s public credit rating. 
 As of September 30, 2024, total availability under the Senior Credit Facility was million. In addition, PFSA has the option to request to increase the revolving credit facility and/or to enter into one or more tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount of up to million, subject to customary conditions, including the commitment of the participating lenders. 
 In addition, Pentair and PFSA are parties to a senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility ), with PFSA, as borrower, Pentair, as guarantor, providing for an aggregate principal amount of billion. The Term Loan Facility has a maturity date of July 28, 2027, with required quarterly installment payments of million which began on the last day of the third quarter of 2023 and increased to million on the last day of the third quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, PFSA repaid the remaining million of quarterly installments on the Term Loan Facility, such that PFSA is not required to make any further quarterly installment payments. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining obligation of million matures on July 28, 2027. Th e Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate, adjusted term secured overnight financing rate, or adjusted daily simple secured overnight financing rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on, at PFSA s election, Pentair s leverage level or PFSA s public credit rating. 
 Our debt agreements contain various financial covenants, but the most restrictive covenants are contained in the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. The Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility contain covenants requiring us not to permit (i) the ratio of our consolidated debt (net of our consolidated unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of million but not to exceed million) to our consolidated net income (excluding, among other things, non-cash gains and losses) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash share-based compensation expense EBITDA on the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters (each, a testing period to exceed to (or, at PFSA s election and subject to certain conditions, to for testing periods in connection with certain material acquisitions) (the Leverage Ratio and (ii) the ratio of our EBITDA to our consolidated interest expense, for the same period to be less than to as of the end of each fiscal quarter. For purposes of the Leverage Ratio, the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility provide for the calculation of EBITDA giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions, divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates. 
 In addition to the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility, we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of million, of which there were outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates.

 Cross currency swaps 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a combined notional amount of million and million, respectively. The agreements are accounted for as either cash flow hedges, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt, or as net investment hedges to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the Euro-U.S. Dollar exchange rate. We had deferred foreign currency losses of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cross currency swap activity. The periodic interest settlements related to our cross currency swap agreements are classified as operating activities. The cash flows that relate to principal balances are classified as financing activities for the cash flow hedges on intercompany debt and investing activities for the net investment hedges. 
 In August 2024, we entered into a transaction to early terminate and cash settle a million cross currency swap agreement, resulting in a net cash payment of million, of which million is included in investing activities and million of interest income is included within operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Subsequent to the termination, we entered into new cross currency swap agreements with euro notional amounts matching the original swap agreement. 
 Hedging of variable interest rates 
 We manage our exposure to certain interest rate risks related to our variable rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps and collars. We enter into these agreements to hedge the variability of interest expense and cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates of our variable rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate notional amount of million and million in interest rate swaps and collars, respectively, that are designated as cash flow hedges.

 million and an unrealized gain of million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our interest rate swap and collar activity. The periodic interest settlements related to our interest rate swaps and collars are classified as operating activities. 
 Fair value measurements 
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date: 
 Level 1: Valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2: Valuation is based on inputs such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3: Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement. 
 In making fair value measurements, observable market data must be used when available. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
 Fair value of financial instruments 
 The following methods were used to estimate the fair values of each class of financial instrument: 
 short-term financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable and variable-rate debt) recorded amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity period; 
 long-term fixed-rate debt, including current maturities fair value is based on market quotes available for issuance of debt with similar terms, which are inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy defined above; 
 foreign currency contracts, interest rate swap and collar agreements fair values are determined through the use of models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curves, as well as other relevant economic measures, which are inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy defined above; and 
 deferred compensation plan assets (mutual funds, common/collective trusts and cash equivalents for payment of certain non-qualified benefits for retired, terminated and active employees) fair value of mutual funds and cash equivalents are based on quoted market prices in active markets that are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy defined above; fair value of common/collective trusts are valued at net asset value NAV ), which is based on the fair value of the underlying securities owned by the fund and divided by the number of shares outstanding.

We evaluate performance based on net sales and reportable segment income and use a variety of ratios to measure performance of our reporting segments. These results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Reportable segment income represents operating income of each reportable segment inclusive of equity income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and exclusive of intangible amortization, costs of restructuring and transformation activities, impairments, legal accrual adjustments and settlements and other unusual non-operating items. Corporate and other activity primarily consists of corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, including executive office, board of directors, and centrally-managed corporate functional or shared service costs related to finance, human resources, communications and corporate development. These activities do not meet the criteria for a stand-alone reporting segment under accounting standards codification ASC 280.

 Overview 
 The terms us, we, our or Pentair refer to Pentair plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. At Pentair, we believe the health of our world depends on reliable access to clean water. We deliver a comprehensive range of smart, sustainable water solutions to homes, businesses and industries around the world. Our industry-leading and proven portfolio of solutions enables our customers to access clean, safe water; reduce water consumption; and recover and reuse water. Whether it s moving, improving or helping people enjoy water, we help manage life s most essential resource. We are composed of three reporting segments: Flow, Water Solutions and Pool. For the first nine months of 2024, the Flow, Water Solutions and Pool segments represented approximately 37 , 28 and 35 of total revenues, respectively. We classify our operations into reporting segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served: 
 Flow The focus of this segment is to deliver water where it is needed, when it is needed, more efficiently and to transform waste into value. This segment designs, manufactures and sells a variety of fluid treatment and pump products and systems, including pressure vessels, gas recovery solutions, membrane bioreactors, wastewater reuse systems and advanced membrane filtration, separation systems, water disposal pumps, water supply pumps, fluid transfer pumps, turbine pumps, solid handling pumps and agricultural spray nozzles, while serving the global residential, commercial and industrial markets. These products and systems are used in a range of applications, including fluid delivery, ion exchange, desalination, food and beverage, separation technologies for the oil and gas industry, residential and municipal wells, water treatment, wastewater solids handling, pressure boosting, circulation and transfer, fire suppression, flood control, agricultural irrigation and crop spray. 
 Water Solutions The focus of this segment is to provide great-tasting, higher-quality water and ice while helping people use water more productively. This segment designs, manufactures and sells commercial and residential water treatment products and systems including pressure tanks, control valves, activated carbon products, commercial ice machines, conventional filtration products, and point-of-entry and point-of-use water treatment systems. These water treatment products and systems are used in residential whole home water filtration, drinking water filtration and water softening solutions in addition to commercial total water management and filtration in foodservice operations. In addition, our water solutions business also provides installation and preventative services for water management solutions for commercial operators.

 Pool The focus of this segment is to provide innovative, energy-efficient pool solutions to help people more sustainably enjoy water. This segment designs, manufactures and sells a complete line of energy-efficient residential and commercial pool equipment and accessories including pumps, filters, heaters, lights, automatic controls, automatic cleaners, maintenance equipment and pool accessories. Applications for our pool products include residential and commercial pool maintenance, pool repair, renovation, service, construction and aquaculture solutions. 
 Key Trends and Uncertainties Regarding Our Existing Business 
 The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in the first nine months of 2024 and are reasonably likely to impact our results in the future: 
 In 2021, we created a transformation office and launched and committed resources to the Transformation Program designed to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion by driving operational excellence, reducing complexity and streamlining our processes. During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, we made strategic progress on our Transformation Program initiatives with a focus on our four key themes of pricing excellence, strategic sourcing, operations excellence and organizational effectiveness. We expect to continue to execute on our key Transformation Program initiatives to drive margin expansion and to continue to incur transformation costs throughout the remainder of 2024 and beyond. 
 In 2024, we began using 80/20 guiding principles to enable our Transformation Program. This 80/20 analysis is expected to create value by focusing on the right customers and products through quadrant based strategies. We expect the analysis to result in actions to improve operating performance by reducing lower margin sales and removing complexity in the future. 
 During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, we executed certain business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business. We expect these actions to continue throughout the remainder of 2024 and to drive margin growth. 
 During 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, we experienced inflationary cost increases for certain raw materials as well as logistics and transportation costs. The current volatile market for commodities has the potential to continue to drive price increases in our supply chain. While we have taken pricing actions and implemented transformation initiatives that we expect to improve productivity and offset cost increases, we anticipate inflationary cost increases to continue for the remainder of 2024. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar Two Model Rules Pillar Two for a global 15.0 minimum tax are in the process of being adopted by a number of jurisdictions in which we operate. Pillar Two has negatively impacted our effective tax rate in 2024. That impact could change in the future as we continue to evaluate the enacted legislative changes and as new guidance becomes available. 
 We have identified specific product and geographic market opportunities that we find attractive and continue to pursue, both within and outside the U.S. We expect to continue investing in our businesses to drive these opportunities through research and development and additional sales and marketing resources. Unless we successfully penetrate these markets, our core sales growth will likely be limited or may decline. 
 
 In 2024, our operating objectives focus on delivering our core and building our future. We expect to execute these objectives by: 
 Delivering profitable revenue growth and productivity for customers and shareholders; 
 Continuing to focus on capital allocation through: 
 Committing to maintain our investment grade rating; 
 Focusing on reducing our long-term debt; 
 Returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and 
 Accelerating our performance with strategically aligned mergers and acquisitions; 
 Focusing growth initiatives that accelerate our investments in digital, innovation, technology and ESG;

 Net sales 
 The components of the consolidated net sales change from the prior period were as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year period over the prior year period Volume (3.7) (2.1) Price 2.2 2.0 Core growth (1.5) (0.1) Acquisition/Divestitures (0.2) (0.1) Currency 0.2 (0.1) Total (1.5) (0.3) 
 The 1.5 and 0.3 percent decreases in net sales in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of 2024 from 2023 were primarily driven by: 
 decreased sales volume in our residential flow and industrial solutions businesses within our Flow segment compared to the prior year; 
 decreased sales volume within our commercial and residential businesses in our Water Solutions segment compared to the prior year, in addition to the completion of a large project in 2023 within our commercial business that did not recur in the first nine months of 2024; and 
 a product line exit in our Pool segment that occurred in the first nine months of 2024. 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 These decreases were partially offset by: 
 increased selling prices in our Flow segment, in our commercial business within our Water Solutions segment and in our Pool segment to mitigate inflationary cost increases; 
 increased sales volume in our commercial flow business within our Flow segment compared to the prior year; 
 increased sales volume within our Pool segment due to higher demand compared to the prior year; and 
 favorable foreign currency effects compared to the third quarter of the prior year. 
 Gross profit 
 The 2.7 and 2.3 percentage point increases in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of 2024 from 2023 were primarily driven by: 
 increases in selling prices to mitigate impacts of inflationary costs; 
 increased productivity mainly driven by transformation initiatives across all segments and manufacturing leverage within our Pool segment; and 
 asset impairment and write-offs of 3.5 million recorded in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 5.3 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 inflationary cost increases related to labor costs and certain raw materials. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A 
 The 2.7 and 1.2 percentage point increases in SG A as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of 2024 from 2023 were primarily driven by: 
 transformation costs of 41.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 28.0 million in the first nine months of 2023; 
 restructuring and other costs of 23.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, and 33.9 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 5.1 million in the first nine months of 2023; and 
 asset impairment charges of 5.7 million in third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, and 5.8 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 0.9 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 a reduction in our legal accrual of 7.5 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to an increase in our legal accrual of 2.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Net interest expense 
 The 28.0 and 20.0 percent decreases in net interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of 2024 from 2023 were primarily driven by: 
 lower variable debt compared to the same period of the prior year. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 The 0.7 and 0.4 percentage point decreases in the effective tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months, respectively, of 2024 from 2023 were primarily driven by: 
 the favorable impact of discrete items that occurred during the first nine months of 2024 that did not occur in the same period of the prior year. 
 These decreases were partially offset by: 
 the unfavorable mix of global earnings.

 BACKLOG OF ORDERS BY SEGMENT 
 In millions September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Change Flow 344.7 390.1 (45.4) (11.6) Water Solutions 84.3 108.5 (24.2) (22.3) Pool 94.6 239.7 (145.1) (60.5) Total backlog 
 523.6 738.3 (214.7) (29.1) 
 The majority of our backlog is short cycle in nature with shipments within one year from when a customer places an order and a substantial portion of our revenues has historically resulted from orders received and products delivered in the same month. A portion of our backlog, particularly from orders for major capital projects, can take more than one year from order to delivery depending on the size and type of order. We record, as part of our backlog, all orders from external customers, which represent firm commitments, and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract. Our backlog of orders is dependent upon when customers place orders and is not necessarily an indicator of our expected results for our 2024 net sales. The decrease in our overall backlog from December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by our backlog trending down to more historical levels as a result of increased manufacturing capacity and improved lead times within each of our reportable segments as well as delivery of orders associated with certain advance sale early buy programs within our Pool segment. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We generally fund cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations, availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances, public and private debt and equity offerings. Our primary revolving credit facility has generally been adequate for these purposes, although we have negotiated additional credit facilities or completed debt and equity offerings as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions. 
 We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets. Consistent with historical trends, we experienced seasonal cash usage in the first quarter of 2024 and drew on our revolving credit facility to fund our operations. This cash usage reversed in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaked and generated significant cash to fund our operations. We continued to generate significant cash to fund our operations in the third quarter of 2024. 
 End-user demand for pool equipment in the Pool segment, water solution products in the Water Solutions segment, and residential water supply and agricultural products within the Flow segment follows warm weather trends, with seasonal highs from April to September. The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale early buy programs (generally including extended payment terms and/or additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly by temperature, heavy flooding and droughts. 
 We expect to continue to have sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly. We believe our existing liquidity position, coupled with our currently anticipated operating cash flows, will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months.

 Operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflects net income from continuing operations, net of non-cash depreciation, definite-lived intangible amortization, share-based compensation and asset impairment, of 580.5 million. Additionally, we had a cash inflow of 80.9 million as a result of changes in net working capital, primarily due to lower inventory and accounts receivable balances. These decreases were primarily related to supply chain efficiencies and improved lead times. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the first nine months of 2023 primarily reflects net income from continuing operations, net of non-cash depreciation, definite-lived intangible amortization and asset impairment, of 506.8 million. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflects capital expenditures of 51.7 million and cash paid upon the settlement of net investment hedges of 16.4 million. 
 Net cash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2023 primarily reflects capital expenditures of 54.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 5.4 million. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 primarily relates to the repayment of 200.0 million term loans under the Senior Credit Facility, 162.5 million Term Loan Facility principal payments, dividend payments of 114.3 million and share repurchases of 100.0 million. 
 Net cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 primarily relates to net repayments of revolving long-term debt of 320.0 million and dividend payments of 108.9 million. 
 Free cash flow 
 In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure our free cash flow. We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that is equal to 100 percent conversion of net income. Free cash flow is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends, repurchase shares and repay debt. In addition, free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation-based incentives. Our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

 Debt and capital 
 Pentair, Pentair Finance S. r.l PFSA and Pentair, Inc. are parties to a credit agreement (the Senior Credit Facility ), with Pentair as guarantor and PFSA and Pentair, Inc. as borrowers, providing for a 900.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. During the second quarter of 2024, PFSA repaid 200.0 million of term loans under the Senior Credit Facility. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of December 16, 2026. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate, adjusted term secured overnight financing rate, adjusted euro interbank offered rate, adjusted daily simple secured overnight financing rate or central bank rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on, at PFSA s election, Pentair s leverage level or PFSA s public credit rating. 
 As of September 30, 2024, total availability under the Senior Credit Facility was 900.0 million. In addition, PFSA has the option to request to increase the revolving credit facility and/or to enter into one or more tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount of up to 300.0 million, subject to customary conditions, including the commitment of the participating lenders. 
 In addition, Pentair and PFSA are parties to a senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility ), with PFSA, as borrower, Pentair, as guarantor, providing for an aggregate principal amount of 1.0 billion. The Term Loan Facility has a maturity date of July 28, 2027, with required quarterly installment payments of 6.3 million which began on the last day of the third quarter of 2023 and increased to 12.5 million on the last day of the third quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, PFSA repaid the remaining 162.5 million of quarterly installments on the Term Loan Facility, such that PFSA is not required to make any further quarterly installment payments. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining obligation of 825.0 million matures on July 28, 2027. The Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate, adjusted term secured overnight financing rate, or adjusted daily simple secured overnight financing rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on, at PFSA s election, Pentair s leverage level or PFSA s public credit rating. 
 Our debt agreements contain various financial covenants, but the most restrictive covenants are contained in the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. The Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility contain covenants requiring us not to permit (i) the ratio of our consolidated debt (net of our consolidated unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of 5.0 million but not to exceed 250.0 million) to our consolidated net income (excluding, among other things, non-cash gains and losses) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash share-based compensation expense EBITDA on the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters (each, a testing period to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 (or, at PFSA s election and subject to certain conditions, 4.25 to 1.00 for four testing periods in connection with certain material acquisitions) (the Leverage Ratio and (ii) the ratio of our EBITDA to our consolidated interest expense, for the same period to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. For purposes of the Leverage Ratio, the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility provide for the calculation of EBITDA giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions, divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates. 
 In addition to the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility, we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of 21.0 million, of which there were no outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. 
 We have 19.3 million of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months. We classified this debt as long-term as of September 30, 2024 as we have the intent and ability to refinance such obligation on a long-term basis under the revolving credit facility under the Senior Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 94.8 million of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences.

 Share repurchases 
 In December 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit of 750.0 million. This authorization expires on December 31, 2025. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1.2 million of our ordinary shares for 100.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 500.0 million available for share repurchases under this authorization. 
 Dividends payable 
 On September 23, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.23 per share, payable on November 1, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 18, 2024. As a result, the balance of dividends payable included in Other current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was 38.0 million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We paid dividends in the first nine months of 2024 of 114.3 million, or 0.69 per ordinary share compared with 108.9 million, or 0.66 per ordinary share, in the prior year period. 
 
 Under Irish law, the payment of future cash dividends and repurchases of shares may be paid only out of Pentair plc s distributable reserves on its statutory balance sheet. Pentair plc is not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital, which includes share premiums. Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and through a reduction in share capital approved by the Irish High Court. Distributable reserves are not linked to a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP reported amount (e.g., retained earnings). Our distributable reserve balance was 6.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 Supplemental guarantor information 
 Pentair plc (the Parent Company Guarantor ), fully and unconditionally, guarantees the senior notes of PFSA (the Subsidiary Issuer ). The Subsidiary Issuer is a Luxembourg private limited liability company and 100 percent-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company Guarantor. 
 The Parent Company Guarantor is a holding company established to own directly and indirectly substantially all of its operating and other subsidiaries. The Subsidiary Issuer is a holding company formed to own directly and indirectly substantially all of its operating and other subsidiaries and to issue debt securities, including the senior notes. The Parent Company Guarantor s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to make payments on the senior notes pursuant to the guarantees, is dividends from its subsidiaries. The Subsidiary Issuer s principal source of cash flow is interest income from its subsidiaries. None of the subsidiaries of the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer is under any direct obligation to pay or otherwise fund amounts due on the senior notes or the guarantees, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. In addition, there may be statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends from certain subsidiaries of the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer. If such subsidiaries are unable to transfer funds to the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer may not be able to make principal and interest payments on their outstanding debt, including the senior notes or the guarantees.
