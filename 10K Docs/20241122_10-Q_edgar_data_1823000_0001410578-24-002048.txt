 shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Preferred Stock ), at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million, or per share. The Company used a portion of the proceeds from the Equity Forward Transaction to fund the purchase price for the Property in the Business Combination. As a result of the completion of the Equity Forward Transaction and the issuance of the Preferred Stock, there is outstanding liability associated with the Equity Forward as of June 30, 2024.

This redemption feature requires the Preferred Stock to be liability classified due to the conversion feature being considered non-substantive under applicable accounting guidance. However, the Company determined that the redemption features associated with the Preferred Stock are to be considered as clearly and closely related to the host contract and, therefore, do not require separate reporting at fair value for each reporting period. The Preferred Stock entitles Subscriber to receive dividends equal to and in the same form as dividends actually paid on shares of the Company s common stock, in each case, on an as-converted basis. The Preferred Stock does not have voting rights.

Holders of the Public Shares were not entitled to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the completion of the Business Combination, holders of two -thirds of the voting power of the Founder Shares could remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. The Class B common stock automatically converted into Class A common stock at the time of the Business Combination on a -for-one basis. See Note 1.

 and , respectively. The Warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and are presented within derivative warrant liabilities on the Balance Sheets. The derivative warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities in the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations. The liability associated with the Warrants is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The subsequent measurement of the Public Warrants as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market under the ticker CNXXW. As the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone outside of a small group of individuals who are permitted transferees would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants, the Company determined that the fair value of each Private Placement Warrant is equivalent to that of each Public Warrant, with an insignificant adjustment for short-term marketability restrictions. As such, the Private Placement Warrants are classified as Level 2. Convertible Preferred Stock As of June 30, 2024, the Company s liability associated with the Preferred Stock was valued at .If the Preferred Stock has not earlier been converted, the Company will redeem each share of Preferred Stock after the date that is the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Company s initial business combination, on not less than nor more than prior notice, in cash at a price equal to per share, subject to certain customary adjustments. This redemption feature requires the Preferred Stock to be liability classified due to the conversion feature being considered non-substantive under applicable accounting guidance. However, the Company determined that the redemption features associated with the Preferred Stock are to be considered as clearly and closely related to the host contract and, therefore, do not require separate reporting at fair value for each reporting period. The liability associated with the Preferred Stock is measured at fair value as of the issuance date and at the redemption value subsequently. The subsequent measurement of the Preferred Stock as of June 30, 2024 is classified as Level 3 due to the use of unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and which are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. In accordance with ASC 480-10 and after considering several factors, the Company determined that the issue price of per share is deemed to be (or approximate) the fair value of the Preferred Stock at the issuance date. Because the settlement date for the Preferred Stock varies based on specified conditions, the Company s determined that the Preferred Stock should be measured subsequently at the same per share amount as the issue price, which is the price that would be paid by the Company if the Preferred Stock were redeemed at the reporting date.

On March 25, 2024, the Company issued an amended and restated promissory note (the Second Restated Note to nXgen. The Second Restated Note amends, restates, replaces and supersedes the Restated Note to increase the principal amount available for borrowings thereunder from up to 550,000 to up to 900,000. The Second Restated Note does not bear interest, matures on the date of consummation of the Business Combination and is subject to customary events of default. The Second Restated Note was to be repaid only to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account established in connection with its Initial Public Offering. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had borrowed 900,000 under the Second Restated Note. As of the Closing Date, the Company satisfied and discharged its obligations under the Second Restated Note by repaying in full the principal amount to nXgen. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 83,279 principally due to the payment of general and administrative expenses during the period. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 1,516,657 principally due to the payment of general and administrative expenses during the period. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 4,463,792 and cash provided by financing activities of 177,311,864. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was 56,637,519 and net cash used in financing activities was 56,387,518. As of June 30, 2024 we had operating cash of 172,772,954 and investments held in the Trust Account of 0. As of December 31, 2023 we had operating cash of 8,162 and investments held in the Trust Account of 21,966,104. On May 1, 2024, we closed our Business Combination. Approximately 20.58 million of funds held in the Trust Account were used to pay the redemption of 1,941,684 shares of Class A common stock and 55,734 of funds were withdrawn for tax disbursements. The Trust Account was closed and 1,503,969 of funds remaining in the Trust Account were released to the Company pursuant to the trust agreement. Management has taken several actions to further the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. On May 1, 2024, the Company completed its Business Combination. In addition, on May 1, 2024, the Company completed the Equity Forward Transaction, resulting in cash proceeds to the Company aggregating approximately 200 million. In connection with the Transaction, the Company entered into the Seller Lease Agreement, which results in annual rental revenue of approximately 3 million. Management believes that these actions will enable the Company to continue as a going concern through November 22, 2025, which is twelve months subsequent to the date on which these financial statements were issued. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 

 -27- 

Table of Contents 
 amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting policies, except as described below. Warrant Liabilities We account for our warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for liability classification under ASC 815. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. Our Public and Private Placement Warrants meet the criteria as liability classified derivative instruments and are recorded at fair value on the grant date and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations. We will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the exercise or expiration of the Private Placement Warrants. At that time, the portion of the liability related to the Private Placement Warrants will be reclassified to additional paid-in capital. Preferred Stock Liability We account for our Preferred Stock as a liability due to the conversion feature being considered non-substantive under applicable accounting guidance. However, the Company determined that the redemption features associated with the Preferred Stock are to be considered as clearly and closely related to the host contract and, therefore, do not require separate reporting at fair value for each reporting period. In accordance with ASC 480-10 and after considering several factors, the Company determined that the issue price of 11.50 per share is deemed to be (or approximate) the fair value of the Preferred Stock at the issuance date. Because the settlement date for the Preferred Stock varies based on specified conditions, the Company s determined that the Preferred Stock should be measured subsequently at the same per share amount as the issue price, which is the price that would be paid by the Company if the Preferred Stock were redeemed at the reporting date. Recent Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our unaudited condensed financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result, pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this report, are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current

Table of Contents 
 chief executive officer (our Certifying Officer ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officer concluded that, due to the material weakness we previously identified in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim unaudited condensed financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. As previously reported, we changed the classification of our warrants from equity to liability treatment, measured at fair value with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings. Additionally, in connection with the preparation of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021, management re-evaluated our application of ASC 480-10-S99 with respect to the accounting classification of our redeemable shares of Class A common stock (the Public Shares ). Upon such re-evaluation, management determined that the Public Shares include redemption provisions that require classification of the Public Shares as temporary equity, regardless of the minimum net tangible asset requirement, and as a result, concluded that certain of our previously issued financial statements should be restated to reflect the reclassification, as discussed in Note 2 to our financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (Amendment No. 2), filed with the SEC on February 4, 2022. Also, in connection with the change in presentation for the Public Shares, we restated our earnings per share calculation to allocate income and losses shared pro rata between the two classes of shares of our common stock. As a result of the foregoing, our management concluded that there was a material weakness related to our accounting for complex financial instruments in internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, we plan to continue to enhance our system of evaluating and implementing the accounting standards that apply to our accounting for complex financial instruments, including through enhanced analyses by our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. We can offer no assurance that our remediation plan will ultimately have the intended effects. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting other than management s remediation efforts described above.
