(the 2024 Stock Split ), which resulted in a reduction in
the number of outstanding shares of common stock, warrants, stock options and restricted share units and a proportionate increase in the
value of each share or strike price of the warrants and stock options. The common stock began trading on a reverse split-adjusted basis
on the NASDAQ on January 4, 2024. 

As a result of the 2024 Stock Split, unless described
otherwise, all references to common stock, share data, per share data and related information contained in these financial statements
have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock splits for all periods presented. In addition, any fractional shares
that would otherwise be issued as a result of the stock splits were rounded up to the nearest whole share. Further, the number of shares
issuable and exercise prices of stock options and warrants have been retrospectively adjusted in these financial statements for all periods
presented to reflect the 2024 Stock Split. 

The following tables present selected share information
reflecting on a retroactive basis the reverse stock splits as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023:

Nasdaq 1.00
Minimum Bid Price Notice 

On April 8, 2024, we received a written notice (the Bid Price
Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq indicating that the Company
was not in compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on
The Nasdaq Capital Market (the Bid Price Requirement ). 

The Bid Price Notice did not result in the immediate delisting of the Company s
common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

The Nasdaq Listing Rules require listed securities to maintain a minimum
bid price of 1.00 per share and, based upon the closing bid price of the Company s common stock for the 30 consecutive business
days for the period ending April 5, 2024, the Company no longer met this requirement. 

The Notice indicated that the Company will be
provided 180 calendar days (or until October 7, 2024) in which to regain compliance. We did not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2)
prior to the expiration of the initial 180 calendar day period on October 7, 2024. On October 8, 2024, we received from the Nasdaq staff
(the Staff written notification that our securities are subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. We had an
appeal hearing on October 10, 2024 before a Nasdaq hearings panel (the Panel appeal the delisting notice from the Staff.
While the appeal process is pending, the suspension of trading of our common stock will be stayed. Our common stock will continue to trade
on Nasdaq until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues a written decision. The Panel has granted the Company an extension
until January 31, 2025 to demonstrate compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. 

At the Company s special stockholders meeting on September
23, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved a proposal to grant discretionary authority to our board of directors to (i) amend
our certificate of incorporation to combine outstanding shares of our common stock into a lesser number of outstanding shares, or a reverse
stock split, at a specific ratio within a range of (1-for-5) to a maximum of a (1-for-50) split, with
the exact ratio to be determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion; and (ii) effect the reverse stock split, if at all,
within one year of the date the proposal was approved by stockholders. The Company intends to implement a reverse stock split in the near
future in order to assist with the Company s compliance with Nasdaq s Bid Price Requirement. 

Nasdaq Stockholder Equity Notice 

On August 22, 2024, the Company received a letter
from Nasdaq indicating that that the Company was not in compliance with the requirement to have at least 2,500,000 in stockholders 
equity (the Stockholders Equity Requirement ). In its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30,
2024, the Company reported stockholders equity of 1,642,177, and, as a result, did not satisfy Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). 

Accordingly, the Staff determined to delist our
common stock from Nasdaq. Nasdaq s letter provided the Company until August 29, 2024 to request an appeal of this determination.
The Company requested a hearing before the Panel to appeal the delisting notice from the Staff. The hearing request stays any suspension
or delisting action pending the conclusion of the hearing process and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the
Panel following the hearing. 

We had an appeal hearing on October 10, 2024 before
the Panel to appeal the delisting notice from the Staff. The Panel granted the Company an extension until January 31, 2025 to demonstrate
compliance with the Stockholders' Equity Requirement. While the appeal process is pending, the suspension of trading of the Company s
common stock will be stayed. Our common stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq until the hearing process concludes and the Panel issues
its final written determination. 

The Company intends to take all reasonable measures
available to regain compliance under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and remain listed on Nasdaq. The Company is currently evaluating its available
options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum stockholders equity requirement.

Warrants with an exercise price of 10.02 and 4.58 per share 0.6262 and 0.2856 pre-2024 split), respectively. The

Determining Fair Value of Stock Options 

The fair value of each grant of stock options was
determined by the Company using the methods and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires
significant judgment to determine. 

Valuation and Amortization Method The
Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. This fair value is then amortized
over the requisite service periods of the awards. 

Expected Term The Company estimates the
expected term of stock option by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option, as illustrated by the
simplified method. 

Expected Volatility The expected volatility
is derived from the Company s expectations of future market volatility over the expected term of the options. 

Risk-Free Interest Rate The risk-free
interest rate is based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield curve on the date of grant. 

Dividend Yield The dividend yield assumption
is based on the Company s history and expectation of no dividend payouts.

to 577,969 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 60,900, or 11 . Increased post-market clinical expense related
to the Clarity trial, greater marketing expense, and increased benefits costs were offset in part by a reduction in restricted stock vesting
expense related to the Company s engagement of Key Opinion Leaders. 

Research and Development . Research
and development expenses were 636,940 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 652,657 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 15,717, or 2 . 

General and Administrative . General
and administrative expenses were 2,402,408 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 121,900 or 5 , from 2,524,308
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by reduced bonus accruals, lower personnel expense, and decreased
D O insurance premiums, offset in part by higher legal and finance support costs and increased investment in investor relations. 

Other Income (Expense) . 

 Interest expense was 535,199 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 320,349 from the 214,850 incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase
in interest expense was due to the increase in debt taken on by the Company in 2023. In May, September and November 2023 the Company issued
 2,594,118 aggregate principal amount of unsecured non-convertible notes to certain accredited investors. (see Note 9 to the condensed
financial statements). 

The Company incurred losses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, on three transactions to reduce debt. The first transaction took place between January 22 and January 29, 2024,
whereby the Company entered into a series of exchange agreements with investors to issue an aggregate of 644,142 post-split shares of
common stock in exchange for 1,519,779 principal and accrued interest on the notes. This transaction accelerated the recognition of the
related note discounts and resulted in a 1,066,732 charge. The second transaction was on March 6, 2024, whereby the Company paid 300,974
of principal and accrued interest on the notes. This transaction accelerated the recognition of the related note discounts and resulted
in a 111,928 charge. The third transaction was on August 14, 2024, whereby the Company entered into an exchange agreement with investors
to issue an aggregate of 930 shares of B-Series convertible preferred stock in exchange for 930,052 principal and accrued interest on
the notes. 

The Company s warrant and derivative liabilities
are recorded at fair value as of each reporting date (see Note 3 to the condensed financial statements). For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company recorded a favorable adjustment in fair value of 330,632. 

Other net income of 93,284 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, included a favorable discount to accounts payable of 117,985, offset in part by a 25,000 penalty paid to investors
related to a failure to timely register certain commitment shares. 

Critical
accounting policies and use of estimates 

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various
other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions
on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. 

While our significant accounting policies are
described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical
to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

28 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company derives its revenues from one source,
the delivery of Nociscan reports to medical professionals. Revenues are recognized when a contract with a customer exists, and the control
of the promised services are transferred to our customers. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects
to receive in exchange for those services. Our revenues are generated from contracts with customers in the United
States and internationally. 

Equity-Based Compensation 

Certain of our employees and consultants have received
grants of common stock options and RSUs in our company. These awards are accounted for in accordance with guidance prescribed for accounting
for equity-based compensation. Based on this guidance and the terms of the awards, the awards are equity classified. 

Until our April 2022 initial public offering, we were
a private company with no active public market for our common equity. Therefore, we had periodically determined the overall value of our
company and the estimated per share fair value of our common equity at their various dates using contemporaneous valuations performed
in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of CPA s Practice Aid. Since a public trading market for our
common stock has been established in connection with the completion of our initial public offering, it will no longer be necessary for
us to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for equity awards we may grant, as the fair value
of our common stock will be its public market trading price. 

For financial reporting purposes, we performed common
stock valuations as a private company with the assistance of a third-party specialist. Subsequent to the initial public offering, the
fair value of the Company s common stock underlying its equity awards is based on the quoted market price of the Company s
common stock on the grant date. 

Going Concern 

The Company believes that the net proceeds from the common shares offered
at-the-market in August 2024 and the issuance of C-Series preferred stock in September 2024 will be sufficient to fund current operating
plans into December 2024. The Company has based these estimates, however, on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and could
spend available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. The Company will need to raise additional funds to continue
funding our technology development. Management plans to secure such additional funding. 

As a result of the Company s recurring losses
from operations and the need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements, there is uncertainty regarding the
Company s ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Liquidity and capital resources 

Sources of liquidity 

To date, the Company has financed operations primarily
through public and private offerings of our debt and equity securities and PPP loans that were forgiven. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company completed a public offering of 5,175,000 units Units at a price of 0.58 per Unit, for gross proceeds of approximately
 3.0 million, before deducting offering expenses. Additionally, the Company raised approximately 1.4M of net proceeds from an equity
line in January 2024 and 0.3M in April 2024, retired approximately 930K of debt in exchange for 930 shares of B-Series preferred stock
in August 2024, issued common stock pursuant to our Reg A+ offering of 529K, and issued 1,000 shares of C-Series preferred stock in September
2024 for proceeds of 1.0M. 

29 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash,
including 10,000 of restricted cash, of 1,322,098. The Company believes that this cash will be sufficient to fund current operating
plans into December 2024. The Company has based these estimates, however, on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and could spend available
financial resources much faster than we currently expect. The Company will need to raise additional funds to continue funding our technology
development. Management plans to secure such additional funding.

On February 27, 2024, the Company completed a
public offering of 5,175,000 units Units at a price of 0.58 per Unit, for gross proceeds of approximately 3.0 million,
before deducting offering expenses. Each Unit was comprised of (i) one share of common stock or, in lieu of common stock, one prefunded
warrant to purchase a share of common stock, and (ii) two common warrants, each common warrant to purchase a share of common stock. The
prefunded warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of 0.00001 per share of common stock and only expire when such prefunded warrants
are fully exercised. The common warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of 0.58 per share of common stock and will expire five
years from the date of issuance. 

30 

On March 6, 2024, the Company paid 300,973 of
principal and accrued interest on the November 2023 Notes. 

Between August 12 and August 27, 2024, the Company
issued 1,825,000 shares of common stock pursuant to our Reg A+ offering for proceeds of 529K. 

On August 14, 2024, the Company entered into an

interest on the September 2023 Notes for 930 shares of newly issued Series B convertible preferred stock Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of 1,000 per share. 

On September 30, 2024, the Company entered into
a securities purchase agreement with accredited investors for a convertible preferred stock and warrants financing. The Company has received
 1,000,000 of gross proceeds in connection with the closing of this financing. The Company issued 1,000 shares of Series C convertible
preferred stock Series C Preferred Stock at a purchase price of 1,000 per share of Series C Preferred Stock. The Series

of Common Stock. The Company also issued warrants exercisable for 5,685,049 shares of Common Stock with a 5.5 year term and an initial
exercise price of 0.1759 per share. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
the Company sold one (1) share of the Company s newly designated Series A preferred stock to Jeffrey Thramann, the Company s
Executive Chairman, for a purchase price of 1,000. The share of Series A preferred stock had proportional voting rights that were limited
to the proposal to approve a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock. Following the March 24, 2023, special meeting, the
Company redeemed the one outstanding share of Series A preferred stock on March 28, 2023, in accordance with its terms. The redemption
price was 1,000. No Series A preferred stock remains outstanding. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
the Company issued 1,437,500 May 2023 Notes, with a maturity date of May 16, 2024, for cash proceeds of 1,250,000. The May 2023 Notes
contained an original issue discount of 15.0 and accrued interest at an annual rate of 8.0 .

of the May 2023 Notes, the Company exercised their right to an additional financing, issuing 862,500 September 2023 Notes that mature
on September 1, 2024, for cash proceeds of 750,000. The September 2023 Notes contained an original issue discount of 15.0 and accrued
interest at an annual rate of 8.0 . 

Funding requirements 

Developing medical technology products is a time-consuming,
expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and the Company may never generate meaningful revenues. Accordingly, we
may need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives. 

Adequate additional funds may not be available to
us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that the Company raises additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the
ownership interest of existing stockholders may be diluted. Any debt or preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements
that include restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital
expenditures or declaring dividends, which could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business, and may require the issuance of
warrants, which could potentially dilute existing stockholders ownership interests. 

If we raise additional funds through licensing agreements
and strategic collaborations with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technology, future revenue streams,
research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional
funds, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce and/or terminate development of our product candidates or any future commercialization
efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 

31 

Contractual obligations and commitments 

The Company does not have any contractual obligations
not otherwise on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

The Company did not have, during the periods presented,
and we do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

The Company reviewed all recently issued standards
and has determined that, as disclosed in Note 4 to our condensed financial statements appearing in this quarterly report, there have been
no recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

Emerging growth company and smaller reporting company
status 

The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company such
as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies
until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to opt out of this extended transition
period and, as a result, we will not adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards
is required for public entities. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to other public companies that do not elect
the extended transition period. 

We are also a smaller reporting company 
meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100
million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value
of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently
completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting
company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements
that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two
most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies,
smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods required under the SEC s rules and forms and that the information is gathered and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), to allow
for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

32 

As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that due to our limited resources our disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective in providing material information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings on a timely basis
and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure about our internal
control over financial reporting discussed below. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company worked with an outside firm to establish best practices to improve our required disclosure about our internal control over
financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023, due to material weaknesses related
to (1) a limited segregation of duties due to our lack of formal control documentation, limited resources, and the small number of employees,
and (2) a lack of adequate accounting resources to properly account for complex accounting transactions. Management determined that these
control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses, which could result in material misstatements of significant accounts and disclosures
that could result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. In
addition, due to limited staffing, we are not always able to detect minor errors or omissions in reporting. 

The Company did engage an outside firm in the
third quarter of 2023 to provide accounting support and increased segregation of duties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company continued to work with the outside firm to establish best practices over time that enhance internal control over financial
reporting. 

Other than the applicable remediation efforts
described above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

33 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time, the Company may be involved in
litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not currently a party to any material
legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in our management s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material
adverse effect on the results of our operations or financial position. There are no material proceedings in which any of our directors,
officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial stockholder of more than 5 of our common stock is an adverse party or has a material
interest adverse to our interest. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

In addition to the information set forth in this Form
10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. There have been no material changes to our risk factors from
those included in such Annual Report except as noted below. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem
immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors
from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds. 

Not applicable. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 

Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director
or officer of the Company or or otherwise had in effect a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule
10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
