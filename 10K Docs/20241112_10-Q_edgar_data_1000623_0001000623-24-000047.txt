The maximum funding commitment of the Receivables Sales Agreement is million. The agreement has an initial term of and can be renewed. 
 
 In connection with the Receivables Sales Agreement, the Company formed a separate bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity ("SPE"), which is a wholly owned and controlled subsidiary.

 The Company has continuing involvement with the receivables transferred by the SPE to the third-party financial institution by providing collection services. 
 
 The Company also participates in uncommitted trade accounts receivable sales programs ("Reverse Receivables Programs") under which certain trade receivables are sold, without recourse, to a third-party financial institution in exchange for cash. The Company does not retain any interest in or continuing involvement with the invoices after they are sold. The invoices are sold at face value, less a transaction fee. 
 
 The Company accounts for transactions under the Receivables Sales Agreement and Reverse Receivables Programs as sales of financial assets, with the associated receivables derecognized from the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total fees related to the Receivables Sales Agreement and Reverse Receivables Programs are considered to be a loss on the sale of financial assets. Continuous cash activity related to the Receivables Sales Agreement and Reverse Receivables Programs is reflected in cash from operating activities in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 Environmental Matters 
 
 The Company's operations are subject to various nations' federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to environmental matters. The nature of the Company's operations exposes it to the risk of claims with respect to various environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. While the Company has incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, it believes that its future cost of compliance with environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, and its exposure to liability for environmental claims and its obligation to participate in the remediation and monitoring of certain hazardous waste disposal sites, will not have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or unknown contamination or costs of remediation of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by the Company (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs which could have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Employees and Labor Relations 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately of the Company's U.S. workforce and of its Non-U.S. workforce are under collective bargaining agreements. Approximately of all U.S. employees and of Non-U.S. employees are under collective bargaining agreements that will expire in the next 12 months. 
 
 For the Non-U.S. workforce, union membership is voluntary and does not need to be disclosed to the Company under local laws. As a result, the number of employees covered by the collective bargaining agreements in some countries cannot be determined. 
 
 General Matters 
 
 In the ordinary course of conducting business activities, the Company and its subsidiaries become involved in certain other judicial, administrative and regulatory proceedings involving both private parties and governmental authorities. These proceedings include insured and uninsured regulatory, employment, intellectual property, general and commercial liability, environmental and other matters. At this time, the Company does not expect any of these proceedings to have a material effect on its reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the Company can give no assurance that the results of any such proceedings will not materially affect its reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 FAM segment net sales of 189.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 6.2 million, or 3.2 , compared to the prior-year quarter. The FAM net sales decline reflected lower volumes in advanced films along with lower selling prices, partially offset by higher volumes in filtration netting. 
 
 SAS segment net sales of 308.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.5 million, or 2.1 , compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting higher volumes across all end-markets and higher selling prices, partially offset by sales associated with closed and divested facilities. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 The following table presents gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended Percent Change Percent of Net Sales September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change 2024 2023 Net sales 498.5 498.2 0.3 0.1 100.0 100.0 Cost of products sold 404.9 411.5 (6.6) (1.6) 81.2 82.6 Gross profit

Nonmanufacturing Expenses 
 
 The following table presents nonmanufacturing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions): 
 Three Months Ended Percent Change Percent of Net Sales September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change 2024 2023 Selling expense 18.1 20.5 (2.4) (11.7) 3.6 4.1 Research expense 5.7 5.4 0.3 5.6 1.1 1.1 General expense 51.6 63.4 (11.8) (18.6) 10.4 12.7 Nonmanufacturing expenses 
 75.4 89.3 (13.9) (15.6) 15.1 17.9 
 
 Nonmanufacturing expenses of 75.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 13.9 million, or 15.6 , compared to the prior-year quarter. The decrease is primarily due to 2023 expenses related to the EP Divestiture and integration.

 The Company incurred total restructuring and other impairment expense of 11.2 million and 16.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Restructuring and other impairment expenses related to the organizational realignment plan (the "Plan") were comprised primarily of severance charges. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, these charges were 0.7 million, of which 0.2 million, 0.5 million and none incurred within FAM, SAS and Unallocated, respectively. For additional information on the Plan, refer to Note 8. Restructuring and Other Impairment Activities of the Notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Restructuring and other impairment expenses in the FAM segment, excluding costs associated with the Plan, were primarily due to facility closures announced in prior years. 
 
 Restructuring and other impairment expenses in the SAS segment, excluding costs associated with the Plan, included impairment charges of 8.9 million to fully impair the net assets at our Eerbeek, Netherlands facility. The impairment assessment was performed after revising our long-term view on cash flows associated with the facility.

 Operating profit of 7.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 426.9 million, compared to the prior year period. 
 
 In the FAM segment, operating income was 19.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting an unfavorable 2.7 million, or 11.9 , change, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to lower volumes in advanced films, and lower selling prices, partially offset by higher volumes in filtration netting, lower selling and general expenses, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
 
 In the SAS segment, operating income of 10.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 416.1 million, compared to the prior year period, driven by the 2023 401.0 million goodwill impairment, decrease in other impairment expense, favorable manufacturing and distribution costs, favorable relative net selling price versus input cost performance, higher volumes, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher selling and general expenses. 
 
 Unallocated expenses of 23.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 13.5 million, or 36.8 , compared to the prior year period primarily due to the EP Divestiture and integration costs incurred in the prior year period. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense of 18.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.5 million, or 8.9 , compared to the prior year period. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher average balances and higher average interest rates on the floating portion of our outstanding debt in 2024. 
 
 Other Expense, Net 
 
 Other expense, net was 12.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period expense of 0.3 million, primarily driven by other asset related charges and foreign currency losses. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 A 3.2 million income tax benefit in the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in an effective tax rate of 13.3 compared with (6.2) in the prior year period. The net change was primarily due to mix of earnings in the current period, impact from valuation allowance changes in the current and prior periods, and goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes in the prior period. 
 
 Net Loss and Net Loss per Share 
 
 Net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.8 million, or 0.38 per diluted share, compared with net loss of 464.3 million, or 8.50 per diluted share, during the prior-year quarter.

 In the FAM segment, operating income of 59.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 18.6 million, or 23.8 , compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower volumes in advanced films and higher manufacturing costs. 
 
 In the SAS segment, operating income was 30.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting a 415.5 million increase, compared to the prior year period, driven by the 401.0 million goodwill impairment in 2023, favorable relative net selling price versus input cost performance, and favorable distribution and manufacturing expenses, partially offset by lower volume/mix and higher selling and general expenses. 
 
 Unallocated expenses of 86.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 18.5 million, or 17.7 compared to the prior year period primarily due to integration related costs incurred in the prior year period. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense of 55.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.2 million, or 12.7 , compared to the prior year period. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average balances on the floating portion of our outstanding debt in 2024. 
 
 Other Expense, Net 
 
 Other expense, net of 12.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 8.5 million, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by other asset related charges and foreign currency losses. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 A 13.2 million income tax benefit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.8 compared with (6.5) in the prior year period. The net change was primarily due to mix of earnings in the current period, impact from valuation allowance changes in the current and prior periods, and goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes in the prior period. 
 
 Net Loss and Net Loss per Share 
 
 Net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 50.2 million, or 0.93 per diluted share, compared to net loss of 494.1 million, or 9.06 per diluted share, during the prior year period. 
 
 36 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 A major factor in our liquidity and capital resource planning is our generation of cash flow from operations, which is sensitive to changes in the mix of products sold, volume and pricing of our products, as well as changes in our production volumes, costs and working capital. Our liquidity is supplemented by funds available under our Revolving Facility with a syndicate of banks that is used as either operating conditions or strategic opportunities warrant. Market conditions permitting, we may also seek to access the capital markets as we deem appropriate. 
 
 Cash Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 134.5 million of the Company's 162.2 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. We believe our sources of liquidity and capital, including cash on-hand, cash generated from operations, our Revolving Facility, and our Receivables Sales Agreement (an off-balance sheet arrangement as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K), will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, our current and long-term growth plan, and dividend payments. 
 
 Working Capital 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had net operating working capital of 452.1 million, including cash and cash equivalents of 162.2 million, compared to net operating working capital of 433.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of 120.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was attributable primarily to an increase in accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other current liabilities. 
 
 Cash Provided By Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 70.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided of 37.8 million during the prior year period. The increase was attributable to lower net loss adjusted for non-cash items and favorable year-over-year movements in working capital related cash flows. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net changes in operating working capital resulted in cash inflows of 0.8 million, an increase from 13.4 million of outflows during the prior year period. The 14.2 million increase was due to an increase in net changes of accounts payable and other current liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in net changes of inventories and accounts receivable. 
 
 Cash Used In Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 29.4 million, compared to cash outflows of 49.4 million during the prior year period, primarily attributable to changes in capital spending and proceeds from sale of assets. Within investing cash flows, capital spending was 32.9 million compared to 49.4 million in the prior year period. 
 
 Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.2 million, compared to cash used of 13.2 million during the prior year period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities primarily consisted of 127.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Facility, 16.2 million of dividends paid to the Company's stockholders, and payments on our long-term debt of 97.0 million. 
 
 During the prior year period, financing activities primarily consisted of 180.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under the Revolving Facility, 134.2 million of payments on our long-term debt, and 49.8 million of dividends paid to the Company's stockholders. 
 
 The Company presently believes the sources of liquidity discussed above are sufficient to meet our anticipated funding needs for the foreseeable future. 
 37 

Dividends and Share Repurchases 
 
 On November 6, 2024, we announced a cash dividend of 0.10 per share payable on December 20, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024. The covenants contained in the Indenture governing the Notes and Amended Credit Agreement require that we maintain certain financial ratios as disclosed in Note 9. Debt of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, none of which under normal business conditions materially limit our ability to pay such dividends. We will continue to assess our dividend policy in light of our overall strategy, cash generation, debt levels and ongoing requirements for cash to fund operations and to pursue possible strategic opportunities. 
 
 Debt Instruments and Related Covenants 
 
 The following table presents activity related to our debt instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Proceeds from long-term debt 127.0 180.0 Payments on long-term debt (97.0) (134.2) Net proceeds from borrowings 
 30.0 45.8 
 
 Net proceeds from borrowings were 30.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net proceeds from borrowings of 45.8 million during the prior year period. 
 
 Unused borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Agreement was 300.6 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Indenture and Amended Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024. With the current level of borrowing and forecasted results, we expect to remain in compliance with financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 
 Our total debt to capital ratios, as calculated under the Amended Credit Agreement, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 56.4 and 53.8 , respectively. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Form 10-K for the 2023 fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 For further information about our critical accounting policies, please see the discussion of critical accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the section captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates."
