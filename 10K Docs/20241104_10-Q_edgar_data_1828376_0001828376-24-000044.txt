 million of accrued interest receivable as of September 30, 2024 from the measurement of its ACL. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any outstanding accrued interest is reversed against interest income. Accrued interest on loans is reported in the accrued interest receivable and other assets line on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ACL for individual loans begins with the use of normal credit review procedures to identify whether a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other pooled loans and, therefore, should be individually assessed. We evaluate all commercial loans that meet the following criteria: (1) when it is determined that foreclosure is probable, (2) substandard, doubtful and nonperforming loans when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, (3) when it is determined by management that a loan does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans. Credit loss estimates are calculated based on the following three acceptable methods for measuring the ACL: 1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate; 2) the loan s observable market price; or 3) the fair value of the collateral when the loan is collateral dependent. Our individual loan evaluations consist primarily of the fair value of collateral method because most of our loans are collateral dependent. Collateral values are discounted to consider disposition costs when appropriate. A charge-off is recorded if the fair value of the loan is less than the loan balance.

Equity Securities The Company had equity security with a fair value of million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded thousand and thousand of unrealized gains, respectively, which were recorded in Unrealized gain on equity securities in the Consolidated Statements of Income. thousand and thousand at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, are summarized as follows: Home equity and HELOCs Construction -residential Commercial real estate: 1 - 4 family investor Multi-family (five or more) Commercial non-residential Construction and land Commercial Consumer loans Total Loans Allowance for credit losses ) ) Net Loans Mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The total amount of loans serviced for the benefit of others was approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Bank retained the related servicing rights for the loans that were sold and receives a basis point servicing fee from the purchasers of the loans. Custodial escrow balances maintained in connection with the foregoing loan servicing are included in advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance. Allowance for Credit Losses. The following tables set forth the allocation of the Bank s allowance for credit losses by loan category at the dates indicated. The portion of the credit loss allowance allocated to each loan category does not represent the total available for future losses which may occur within the loan category since the total credit loss allowance is a valuation allocation applicable to the entire loan portfolio. The Company generally charges-off the collateral or discounted cash flow deficiency on all loans at 90 days past due and all loans rated substandard or worse that are 90 days past due.

The overall decrease in the allowance during the three months ended September 30, 2024 can be primarily attributed to a decrease in delinquent 1-4 family investor loans and commercial non-residential loans, as well as consistently low levels of net charge-offs, strong asset quality metrics and continued conservative lending practices. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, and exclusive of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the changes in the provision for credit losses for each portfolio of loans were primarily due to fluctuations in the outstanding balance of each portfolio of loans collectively evaluated for impairment. Specifically, we experienced significant growth in our commercial construction and land portfolio during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a corresponding increase in the provision for credit losses for this portfolio. The overall increase in the allowance during the three months ended September 30, 2023 can be primarily attributed to the previously mentioned growth in our commercial construction and land portfolio, partially offset by improved asset quality metrics with continued low levels of net charge-offs and a decrease in non-performing assets. Under the provisions of ASU 326, loans evaluated individually for impairment consist of non-accrual loans. The following table presents the allowance for credit losses and recorded investment by loan portfolio classification at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024: Total allowance Loans receivable ending balance: Individually evaluated for impairment Collectively evaluated for impairment Total portfolio

 Total allowance Loans receivable ending balance: Individually evaluated for impairment Collectively evaluated for impairment Total portfolio Credit Quality Information The following tables represent credit exposures by internally assigned grades as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 that management uses to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The grading analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled or at all. All loans greater than 90 days past due are considered Substandard. The Company s internal credit risk grading system is based on experiences with similarly graded loans. The Company s internally assigned grades are as follows: Pass loans which are protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the underlying collateral. Special Mention loans where a potential weakness or risk exists, which could cause a more serious problem if not corrected. Substandard loans that have a well-defined weakness based on objective evidence and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard asset. In addition, these weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, based on existing circumstances. Loss loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible, or of such value that continuance as an asset is not warranted. The Bank has a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight to help ensure that risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the Pass category unless a specific action, such as nonperformance, repossession, or death occurs to raise awareness of a possible credit event. The Company s Credit Department is responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating of the loans on an ongoing basis. Every credit which must be approved by Loan Committee or the Board of Directors is assigned a risk rating at time of consideration. The Credit Department also annually reviews commercial relationships of 500,000 or greater to assign or re-affirm risk ratings.

Concentration of Credit Risk The Company s primary business activity as of September 30, 2024 was with customers throughout the Delaware Valley through full-service branch offices located in Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania, as well as Burlington, Camden, and Mercer Counties in New Jersey. Accordingly, the Company has extended credit primarily to residential borrowers and commercial entities in this area whose ability to repay their loans is influenced by the region s economy.

 Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis Certain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition. Generally, nonrecurring valuation is the result of the application of other accounting pronouncements which require assets and liabilities to be assessed for impairment or recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans individually evaluated for impairment are generally measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral supporting the loan. Evaluating the collateral for these loans is based on Level 3 inputs utilizing outside appraisals adjusted by management for sales costs and other assumptions regarding market conditions to arrive at fair value. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Company charged-off the collateral deficiency on loans evaluated individually for impairment. As a result, there were specific reserves on loans evaluated individually for impairment as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Other real estate owned (OREO) is measured at fair value, based on appraisals less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure. Valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Income and expenses from operations and changes in valuation allowance are included in the net expenses from OREO. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, there were assets required to be measured and reported at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company's financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in sales transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end. The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company s financial instruments. Cash and Due from Banks and Interest-Bearing Time Deposits The carrying amounts of cash and amounts due from banks and interest-bearing time deposits approximate their fair value due to the relatively short time between origination of the instrument and its expected realization. Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity The fair value of investment and mortgage-backed securities is equal to the available quoted market price. If no quoted market price is available, fair value is estimated using the quoted market price for similar securities. Equity Securities The fair value of equity securities is equal to the available quoted market price. Loans Receivable The fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market inputs at which loans with similar terms are adjusted for liquidity and credit risk. Regulatory Stock The carrying amount of Federal Home Loan Bank stock approximates fair value because Federal Home Loan Bank stock can only be redeemed or sold at par value and only to the respective issuing government supported institution or to another member institution.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements Statements contained in this report that are not historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), which involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is including this statement for purposes of invoking these safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies and expectations of the Company, are generally identifiable by the use of the words believe, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, project, plan, or similar expressions. The Company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain and actual results may differ from those predicted. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in the future. The Company cautions readers of this report that a number of important factors could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those predicted and could affect the future prospects of the Company include, but are not limited to: (i) general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market area, that are worse than expected; (ii) changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our interest margins, reduce the fair value of financial instruments or reduce the demand for our loan products; (iii) increased competitive pressures among financial services companies; (iv) changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; (v) changes in the quality and composition of our loan or investment portfolios; (vi) changes in future allowance for credit losses, including changes required under relevant accounting and regulatory requirements; (vii) the ability to pay future dividends; (viii) changes in real estate market values in our market area; (ix) decreased demand for loan products, deposit flows, competition, or decreased demand for financial services in our market area; (x) major catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods or other natural or human disasters and infectious disease outbreaks, the related disruption of any of these events to local, regional and global economic activity and financial markets, and the impact that any of the foregoing may have on us and our customers and other constituencies; (xi) legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business or changes in the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board; (xii) technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; (xiii) success or consummation of new business initiatives may be more difficult or expensive than expected; (xiv) our ability to successfully execute our business plan and strategies and integrate the business operations of acquired businesses into our business operations (xv) our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk in the current economic environment; (xvi) adverse changes in the securities markets; (xvii) the inability of third party service providers to perform; (xviii) changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by bank regulatory agencies or the Financial Accounting Standards Board; and (xix) the impact of failures or disruptions in or breaches of the Company s operational or security systems, data or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyberattacks or campaigns. The following factors relating to the Merger and the Merger Agreement, among others, could also cause our financial performance to differ materially from that expressed in forward-looking statements: (i) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the Merger Agreement; (ii) the ability to obtain regulatory approvals and satisfy other closing conditions to the Merger, including approval by shareholders of Mid Penn and the Company; (iii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Mid Penn or the Company in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iv) the possibility that the Merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated; (v) diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; and (vi) potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger. Recent Developments On October 31, 2024, the Company and Mid Penn entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Mid Penn with Mid Penn as the surviving corporation. Immediately after the Merger, the Bank will merge with and into Mid Penn Bank, with Mid Penn Bank as the surviving bank.

 Critical Accounting Policies We consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. We consider these accounting policies to be our critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates under different conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. Allowance for Credit Losses We consider the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting policy. Note 2 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended September 30, 2024 discusses significant accounting policies, including the allowance for credit losses. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses. Our financial results are affected by the changes in and the level of the allowance for credit losses. This process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables, and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate allowance for credit losses. As a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity, we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved, should we experience sizeable loan losses in any particular period. For example, changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, economic conditions, or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the allowance for credit losses. Such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for credit losses. We also have approximately 3.1 million as of September 30, 2024 in non-performing assets consisting of non-performing loans. Most of these assets are collateral dependent loans where we have incurred credit losses to write the assets down to their current appraised value less selling costs. We continue to assess the collectability of these loans and update our appraisals on these loans each year. To the extent the property values continue to decline, there could be additional losses incurred on these non-performing loans which may be material. In recent periods, we experienced strong asset quality metrics including low levels of delinquencies, net charge-offs and non-performing assets. Management considered market conditions in deriving the estimated allowance for credit losses; however, given the continued economic difficulties, the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to record assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration paid at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of consideration paid (or the fair value of the equity of the acquiree) over the fair value of net assets acquired represents goodwill. Goodwill totaled 4.9 million at September 30, 2024. Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on a recurring basis, but rather are subject to periodic impairment testing. The provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 350 allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, management considered the then current economic environment in its evaluation, and determined, based on the totality of its qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. No goodwill impairment existed during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense (benefit) is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The evaluation pertaining to the tax expense and related tax asset and liability balances involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity around the ultimate measurement and resolution of these matters. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other assets on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. We assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals

 consistent with our evaluation. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by the authorities and newly issued or enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our operating results. We regularly evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of reserves related to each of these positions. As of September 30, 2024, we had net deferred tax assets totaling 8.1 million. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If currently available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. Management believes, based upon current facts, that it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the deferred tax assets. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets are inherently subjective and are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance that results in additional income tax expense in the period in which it is recognized would negatively affect earnings. Our net deferred tax assets were determined based on the current enacted federal tax rate of 21 . Any possible future reduction in federal tax rates, would reduce the value of our net deferred tax assets and result in immediate write-down of the net deferred tax assets though our statement of operations, the effect of which would be material. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 Summary. Total assets decreased 6.5 million, or 0.8 , to 812.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 818.7 million at June 30, 2024, primarily due to an 8.4 million decrease in net loans and a 2.9 million decrease in investments, partially offset by a 6.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased 6.3 million, or 31.3 , to 26.5 million at September 30, 2024, from 20.2 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to 9.2 million of investment paydowns and an 8.4 million decrease in net loans, partially offset by a 9.0 million decrease in advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh and the repurchase of 1.5 million of shares of stock under previously announced repurchase programs. Investments . Total investments decreased 2.9 million, or 1.2 , to 243.0 million at September 30, 2024, from 245.9 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in investments was primarily due to the maturity and principal paydowns of securities included in the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios, partially offset by a 6.3 million decrease in the gross unrealized loss on available for sale securities. The Company remains focused on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio that provides a steady stream of cash flows both in the current and in rising interest rate environments. Loans. Net loans decreased 8.4 million, or 1.8 , to 462.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 470.6 million at June 30, 2024. The Company maintains conservative lending practices and credit pricing discipline, and is focused on lending to borrowers with high credit quality within its market footprint. Deposits. Deposits remained relatively consistent at 629.8 million at both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a 6.0 million decrease in interest bearing checking accounts, a 3.3 million decrease in savings accounts and a 2.5 million decrease in money market accounts, partially offset by a 10.2 million increase in time deposit accounts. Borrowings. Borrowings decreased 9.0 million, or 18.8 , to 39.0 million at September 30, 2024, from 48.0 million at June 30, 2024. Stockholders Equity . Stockholders equity increased 3.7 million, or 2.9 , to 128.3 million at September 30, 2024, from 124.6 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to a 4.8 million decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of equity related to the unrealized loss on available for sale securities. This increase to stockholders equity was partially offset by the repurchase of 125,441 shares at a total cost of 1.5 million, or 11.83 per share, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 under the Company s previously announced stock repurchase programs, the payment of a 0.03 per share quarterly cash dividend in August 2024 totaling 256 thousand and a 21 thousand net loss recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 Book value per share measured 13.91 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 13.33 as of June 30, 2024, and tangible book value per share measured 13.35 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 12.78 as of June 30, 2024. Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes goodwill and other intangible assets. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Information section below for a reconciliation of tangible book value per share to book value per share. As previously announced, the Company s Board of Directors had authorized seven stock repurchase programs to acquire up to 6,433,769 shares of the Company s outstanding shares. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased a total of 6,423,527 shares under these repurchase programs at a total cost of 75.2 million, or 11.70 per share. Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Summary The following table sets forth the income summary for the periods indicated:

 General The Company recorded a 21 thousand net loss, or (0.00) per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 179 thousand, or 0.02 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded a core net loss of 82 thousand, or (0.01) per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to core net income of 123 thousand, or 0.01 per basic share and 0.03 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Core net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain pre-tax adjustments and the tax impact of such adjustments, and income tax benefit adjustments. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Information section below for a reconciliation of core net income to net income. Net Interest Income For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was 4.1 million, a decrease of 603 thousand, or 12.7 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits, partially offset by an increase in interest income on loans. The net interest margin measured 2.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.52 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in interest rates during the period that caused an increase in the cost of deposits and borrowings that exceeded the increase in interest income on loans. Provision for Credit Losses During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 395 thousand recovery for credit losses primarily due to a decrease in delinquent loans, as well as consistently low levels of net charge-offs, strong asset quality metrics and continued conservative lending

 practices. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 5 thousand provision for credit losses primarily due to an increase in our commercial construction and land loans. Our allowance for credit losses totaled 2.5 million, or 0.54 of total loans, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.0 million, or 0.63 of total loans, as of June 30, 2024. Our total credit losses coverage ratio, including 2.1 million of fair value marks on acquired loans and the 2.5 million allowance for credit losses, was 0.99 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.08 as of June 30, 2024, including 2.2 million of fair value marks on acquired loans and the 3.0 million allowance for credit losses. Based on a review of the loans that were in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, management believes that the allowance is maintained at a level that represents its best estimate of lifetime credit losses. Total credit losses coverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes the fair value mark on acquired loans. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Information section below for a reconciliation of total credit losses coverage ratio to allowance for credit losses coverage ratio. Management uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. Future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors. As a result, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, various bank regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses. Non-Interest Income The following table sets forth a summary of non-interest income for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Service fees 211 215 Earnings on bank-owned life insurance 329 294 Unrealized gain on equity securities 79 73 Other 31 68 Total 650 650 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, non-interest income totaled 650 thousand, respectively. Earnings on bank-owned life insurance increased 35 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase to non-interest income was offset by a decrease in other non-interest income.

Three Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Salaries and employee benefits 2,959 2,935 Occupancy and equipment 706 760 Data processing 506 494 Professional fees 328 210 Amortization of intangible assets 33 41 Other 791 785 Total 5,323 5,225 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense totaled 5.3 million, an increase of 98 thousand, or 1.9 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to a 118 thousand increase in professional fees primarily due to an increase in legal fees. Income Taxes For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a 116 thousand income tax benefit, reflecting an effective tax rate of (84.7) , compared to an income tax benefit of 15 thousand, reflecting an effective tax rate of (9.1) , for the same period in 2023. The income tax benefit recorded during these periods was primarily due to the 329 thousand and 294 thousand of federal tax-exempt income recorded on bank-owned life insurance recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Asset Quality Asset quality metrics remain strong with non-performing assets to total assets decreasing to 0.38 as of September 30, 2024 from 0.40 as of June 30, 2024. Total nonperforming loans consisted of 28 loans to 25 unrelated borrowers at September 30, 2024, as compared to 30 loans to 27 unrelated borrowers at June 30, 2024. Interest income related to non-performing loans would have been approximately 53 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 if these loans had performed in accordance with their terms during the period rather than having been on non-accrual. There are circumstances when foreclosure and liquidations are the remedy pursued. However, from time to time, as part of our loss mitigation strategy, we may renegotiate the loan terms (i.e., interest rate, structure, repayment term, etc.) based on the economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties. We had no loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Average Balances and Yields The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Loan fees, including prepayment fees, are included in interest income on loans and are not material. Non-accrual loans are included in the average balances only. Any adjustments necessary to present yields on a tax-equivalent basis are insignificant.

 Rate/Volume Analysis The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by current rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and volume.

Management believes excluding these items facilitates greater visibility into our core businesses and underlying trends that may, to some extent, be obscured by inclusion of such items. Tangible Book Value per Share. Tangible book value per share represents our total equity less goodwill and other intangible assets divided by total common shares outstanding. Management believes tangible book value per share helps management and investors better understand and assess changes from period to period in stockholders equity exclusive of changes in intangible assets. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (GAAP), and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. The following table provides a reconciliation of tangible book value per share of common stock to book value per share of common stock, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the periods presented.

 Total Credit Losses Coverage Ratio. Total Credit Losses Coverage Ratio represents the total of our allowance for credit losses and the fair value mark on acquired loans divided by total loans excluding the fair value mark on acquired loans. Management believes the total credit losses coverage ratio helps management and investors better understand the total coverage for credit losses on loans. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (GAAP), and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.

The Bank s liquidity ratio was 39.5 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 38.5 as of June 30, 2024. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives. Our liquidity ratio is calculated as the sum of total cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered investments securities divided by the sum of total deposits and total borrowings. The Bank maintains a liquidity ratio policy that requires this metric to be above 10.0 to provide for the effective management of extension risk and other interest rate risks. Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities, other short-term investments, earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the FHLB of Pittsburgh to provide advances and with the Federal Reserve Bank to provide an overnight line of credit. We also have available credit from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank to purchase federal funds. As a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. We had an available borrowing limit of 283.6 million with the FHLB of Pittsburgh at September 30, 2024. There were 39.0 million of FHLB of Pittsburgh advances outstanding at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of 35.9 million, unfunded commitments under lines of credit of 61.6 million and 118 thousand of standby letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled 166.1 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us, we will have to utilize other funding sources, such as FHLB of Pittsburgh advances, in order to maintain our level of assets. Alternatively, we could reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher at the time of renewal. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest rate risk is defined as the exposure to current and future earnings and capital that arises from adverse movements in interest rates. Depending on a bank s asset/liability structure, adverse movements in interest rates could be either rising or falling interest rates. For example, a bank with predominantly long-term fixed-rate assets and short-term liabilities could have an adverse earnings exposure to a rising rate environment. Conversely, a short-term or variable-rate asset base funded by longer term liabilities could be negatively affected by falling rates. This is referred to as re-pricing or maturity mismatch risk. Interest rate risk also arises from changes in the slope of the yield curve (yield curve risk), from imperfect correlations in the adjustment of rates earned and paid on different instruments with otherwise similar re-pricing characteristics (basis risk), and from interest rate related options embedded in our assets and liabilities (option risk). Our objective is to manage our interest rate risk by determining whether a given movement in interest rates affects our net interest income and the market value of our portfolio equity in a positive or negative way and to execute strategies to maintain interest rate risk within established limits. The analysis at September 30, 2024 indicates a level of risk within the parameters of our model. Our management believes that the September 30, 2024 analysis indicates a profile that reflects interest rate risk exposures in both rising and declining rate environments for both net interest income and economic value. Model Simulation Analysis. We view interest rate risk from two different perspectives. The traditional accounting perspective, which defines and measures interest rate risk as the change in net interest income and earnings caused by a change in interest rates, provides the best view of short-term interest rate risk exposure. We also view interest rate risk from an economic perspective, which defines and measures interest rate risk as the change in the market value of portfolio equity caused by changes in the values of assets and liabilities, which fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. The market value of portfolio equity, also referred to as the economic value of equity, is defined as the present value of future cash flows from existing assets, minus the present value of future cash flows from existing liabilities. These two perspectives give rise to income simulation and economic value simulation, each of which presents a unique picture of our risk of any movement in interest rates. Income simulation identifies the timing and magnitude of changes in income resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates over a short-term time horizon (usually one or two years). Economic value simulation reflects the 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities in a more comprehensive fashion, reflecting all future time periods. It can identify the quantity of interest rate risk as a function of the changes in the economic values of assets and liabilities, and the corresponding change in the economic value of equity of the Bank. Both types of simulation assist in identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling interest rate risk and are employed by management to ensure that variations in interest rate risk exposure will be maintained within policy guidelines. We produce these simulation reports and discuss them with our management Asset and Liability Committee and Board Risk Committee on at least a quarterly basis. The simulation reports compare baseline (no interest rate change) to the results of an interest rate shock, to illustrate the specific impact of the interest rate scenario tested on income and equity. The model, which incorporates all asset and liability rate information, simulates the effect of various interest rate movements on income and equity value. The reports identify and measure our interest rate risk exposure present in our current asset/liability structure. Management considers a static (current position) analysis as well as non-parallel and gradual changes in interest rates and the yield curve in assessing interest rate exposures. If the results produce quantifiable interest rate risk exposure beyond our limits, then the testing will have served as a monitoring mechanism to allow us to initiate asset/liability strategies designed to reduce and therefore mitigate interest rate risk. The table below sets forth an approximation of our interest rate risk exposure. The simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024. The income simulation analysis presented represents a one-year impact of the interest scenario assuming a static balance sheet. Various assumptions are made regarding the prepayment speed and optionality of loans, investment securities and deposits, which are based on analysis and market information. The assumptions regarding optionality, such as prepayments of loans and the effective lives and repricing of non-maturity deposit products, are documented periodically through evaluation of current market conditions and historical correlations to our specific asset and liability products under varying interest rate scenarios. Because the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions, these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. While we believe such assumptions to be reasonable, assumed prepayment rates may not approximate actual future prepayment activity on mortgage-backed securities or agency issued collateralized obligations (secured by one- to four-family loans and multi-family loans). Further, the computation does not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates and assumes a constant asset base. Management periodically reviews the rate assumptions based on existing and projected economic conditions and consults with industry experts to validate our model and simulation results. The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the Bank s net portfolio value, the estimated changes in our net portfolio value and net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel changes in market interest rates. 

Twelve Month Net Portfolio Net Interest Income Value Percent Estimated Percent Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) of Change NPV of Change +200 (14.33) 140,414 (2.37) +100 (7.09) 142,245 (1.10) 0 143,825 -100 4.21 144,125 0.21 -200 8.53 144,025 0.14 As of September 30, 2024, based on the scenarios above, net interest income would decrease by approximately 7.09 to 14.33 , over a one-year time horizon in a rising interest rate environment. One-year net interest income would increase by approximately 4.21 to 8.53 in a declining interest rate environment. Economic value at risk would be negatively impacted by a rise in interest rates and would be positively impacted by a decline in interest rates. We have established an interest rate floor of zero percent for measuring interest rate risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure (1) that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and (2) that they are alerted in a timely manner about material information relating to the Company required to be filed in its periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, these legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS For information regarding the Company s risk factors, refer to the Risk Factors in Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 5, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). Except as set forth below, as of September 30, 2024, the risk factors of the Company have not changed materially from those disclosed in the Form 10-K. Failure to complete the Merger could negatively affect our market price, future business and financial results. Although we anticipate closing the Merger in the second quarter of 2025, we cannot guarantee when, or whether, the Merger will be completed. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, we will be subject to a number of material risks, including the following: (i) costs related to the Merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and, in specific circumstances, additional reimbursement and termination fees, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed; (ii) declines in our market price to the extent that the current market price of our common stock already reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed; (iii) the diversion of management s attention from the day-to-day business operations and the potential disruption to each company s employees and business relationships during the period before the completion of the Merger may make it difficult to regain financial and market positions if the Merger does not occur; and (iv) becoming subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger. Regulatory waivers and approvals may not be received or may be received and subsequently expire, be revoked or be amended to impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met. Before the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, may be completed, various waivers, approvals or consents must be obtained from various bank regulatory and other authorities, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. In determining whether to grant these approvals, regulatory authorities consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. These approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to any or all of the following: an adverse development in any party s regulatory standing or any other factors considered by regulators in granting such approvals; governmental, political, or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political or regulatory environment generally, including as a result of changes of the U.S. executive administration, or Congressional leadership and regulatory agency leadership. Even if the approvals are granted, they may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations, or restrictions or that such conditions, limitations, obligations, or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the Merger were completed successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, limitations, obligations, or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Merger. The completion of the Merger is conditioned on the receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals without the imposition of any materially burdensome regulatory condition and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods. Additionally, the completion of the Merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions, or decrees issued by any court or any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that would prevent, prohibit, or make illegal the completion of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Despite the parties expected commitment to use their reasonable best efforts to respond to any request for information and resolve any objection that may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the Merger Agreement, neither party is required under the terms of the Merger Agreement to take any action, commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction in connection with 

 43

 obtaining these approvals, that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the proposed Merger. Further, such approvals are subject to expiration if the transaction is not consummated within the time period provided in the approval. Combining Mid Penn and William Penn may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and Mid Penn may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The success of the Merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of Mid Penn to integrate the Company into its business in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the anticipated benefits of the Merger. If Mid Penn is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost and savings and anticipated benefits of the Merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional unforeseen expenses. Litigation relating to the Merger could require us to incur significant costs and suffer management distraction, as well as delay and/or enjoin the Merger. Neither the Company nor Mid Penn is currently able to predict the outcome of any suit arising out of or relating to the Merger that may be filed in the future. If any letters or complaints are filed, absent allegations that are material, the Company and Mid Penn will not necessarily announce such filings. The Company and Mid Penn could be subject to demands or litigation related to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is consummated. Such actions may create additional uncertainty relating to the Merger, and responding to such demands and defending such actions may be costly and distracting to management. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcomes of any demand or any subsequent litigation, we do not believe that the resolution of such demands or any subsequent litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. The Company and Mid Penn will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that could adversely affect their financial results or the anticipated benefits of the Merger. Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on counterparties to contracts, employees and other parties may have an adverse effect on us or the anticipated benefits of the Merger. These uncertainties could cause contract counterparties and others who deal with us or Mid Penn to seek to change existing business relationships with us or Mid Penn, and may impair our or Mid Penn s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the Merger, as our employees and prospective employees, and the employees and prospective employees of Mid Penn, may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined organization following the Merger. The pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration of the two companies may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our financial results prior to the completion of the Merger and could limit us from pursuing attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. The Merger may be completed on different terms from those contained in the Merger Agreement. Prior to the completion of the Merger, we and Mid Penn may, by mutual agreement, amend or alter the terms of the Merger Agreement, including with respect to, among other things, the Merger consideration or any covenants or agreements with respect to the parties respective operations during the pendency of the Merger Agreement. Any such amendments or alterations may have negative consequences to us. The Merger will not be completed unless important conditions are satisfied or waived, including approval of the Merger Agreement by our shareholders and Mid Penn s shareholders. Specified conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement must be satisfied or waived to complete the Merger. If the conditions are not satisfied or, subject to applicable law, waived, the Merger will not occur or will be delayed and each of Mid Penn and us may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the Merger.
