Nerdy LLC is a holding company that is the sole owner of multiple operating companies, including Varsity Tutors LLC Varsity Tutors and Varsity Tutors for Schools LLC Varsity Tutors for Schools ). As a result of the business combination and related transactions, Nerdy LLC merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nerdy Inc., with Nerdy LLC surviving such merger. Nerdy Inc. is a holding company that has no material assets other than its ownership interests in Nerdy LLC and its indirect interests in the subsidiaries of Nerdy LLC, and has no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. 
 Nerdy Inc. has the following classes of securities issued and outstanding: (i) Class A common stock, par value per share (the Class A Common Stock and (ii) Class B common stock, par value per share (the Class B Common Stock ). The shares of Class B Common Stock are owned by the Legacy Nerdy Holders (as defined below), have voting rights only, and have no dividend or economic rights. The Company does not intend to list its Class B Common Stock on any stock exchange. Nerdy LLC has units issued and outstanding (the OpCo Units to its members, the legacy holders of Nerdy LLC (the Legacy Nerdy Holder(s) and Nerdy Inc. Nerdy Inc. and Nerdy LLC will at all times maintain a -to-one ratio between the number of shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock issued by Nerdy Inc. and the number of OpCo Units issued by Nerdy LLC. 
 The Public and FPA Warrant Exchange, the Private Warrant Transaction, and the Earnout Transaction 
 Prior to the Public and FPA Warrant Exchange and the Private Warrant Transaction (both terms defined below), Nerdy Inc. had warrants that consisted of TPG Pace s previously outstanding private placement warrants and public warrants to purchase Class A ordinary shares that were converted into corresponding private placement warrants to purchase Class A Common Stock (the Private Placement Warrant(s) and public warrants to purchase Class A Common Stock (the Public Warrant(s) ). Each Private Placement Warrant and Public Warrant allowed for the purchase of share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of per share. Additionally, Nerdy Inc. also issued warrants to purchase Class A Common Stock in connection with a forward purchase agreement (the FPA Warrant(s) ). Each FPA Warrant allowed for the purchase of share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of per share. Nerdy LLC had previously outstanding warrants to purchase OpCo Units at an exercise price of (the exercise of which would also result in the issuance of one corresponding share of Class B Common Stock) (the OpCo Warrant(s) ). The Private Placement Warrants, the Public Warrants, the FPA Warrants, and the OpCo Warrants are collectively referred to herein as the Warrant(s). 
 Prior to the Earnout Transaction (as defined below), of the total shares and units issued and outstanding, there were shares or units of (i) Class A Common Stock or (ii) OpCo Units (and a corresponding number of Class B Common Stock), as

 of the reverse recapitalization (assuming there was no change in control event) (the Earnout(s) ). 
 Public and FPA Warrant Exchange 
 On September 25, 2023, the Company concluded an offer to holders of its then outstanding Public Warrants and FPA Warrants, which provided such holders the opportunity to receive shares of Nerdy Inc. s Class A Common Stock (the Public Offer exchange rate in exchange for each Public Warrant and FPA Warrant tendered by such holders (the Offer ). This Offer included a solicitation of consents from holders of the Public Warrants and FPA Warrants to amend the warrant agreement with respect to certain terms of the Public Warrants and the FPA Warrants (the Public and FPA Warrant Amendment , together with the Offer, the Public and FPA Warrant Exchange ). At the closing of the Offer, all remaining outstanding Public and FPA warrants that were not exchanged at the election of the holder were converted into shares of Class A Common Stock, pursuant to the Public and FPA Warrant Amendment. As a result of the Public and FPA Warrant Exchange, Public Warrants and FPA Warrants were exchanged for shares of Nerdy Inc. s Class A Common Stock, with a nominal cash settlement in lieu of fractional shares. No Public Warrants and FPA Warrants remained outstanding after the Public and FPA Warrant Exchange. 
 Private Warrant Transaction 
 Concurrently with the Offer, holders of the then outstanding Private Placement Warrants and the OpCo Warrants agreed to amend the warrant agreement with respect to certain terms of the Private Placement Warrants and OpCo Warrants (the Private Placement Warrant Amendment , together with the Public and FPA Warrant Amendment, the Warrant Amendment ). The Warrant Amendment, among other provisions, required that upon the closing of the Offer that (a) each Private Placement Warrant be automatically exchanged or exercised on a cashless basis into shares of Class A Common Stock and (b) each OpCo Warrant that was outstanding be automatically exercised on a cashless basis into OpCo Units with an equivalent number of shares of Class B Common Stock being issued, in each case, at the same ratio as the Public Offer exchange rate (the Private Warrant Transaction , together with the Public and FPA Warrant Exchange, the Warrant Transactions ). As a result of the Private Warrant Transaction, Private Placement Warrants were exchanged or exercised on a cashless basis for shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock, with a nominal cash settlement in lieu of fractional shares and OpCo Warrants were exchanged or exercised on a cashless basis for OpCo Units (with an equivalent number of shares of Class B Common Stock), with a nominal cash settlement in lieu of fractional shares. No Private Placement Warrants and OpCo Warrants remained outstanding after the Private Warrant Transaction. 
 Earnout Transaction 
 Concurrently with the Offer, holders of the then outstanding Earnouts agreed to forfeit (and thus surrender for cancellation) of the Earnouts they held and agreed that the remaining of the Earnouts would no longer be subject to potential forfeiture and would be either regular shares of Class A Common Stock or regular OpCo Units (with an equivalent number of regular shares of Class B Common Stock) (the Earnout Transaction ). As a result of the Earnout Transaction, shares of Class A Common Stock and OpCo Units (with an equivalent number of shares of Class B Common Stock) were cancelled and shares of Class A Common Stock and OpCo Units (with an equivalent number of shares of Class B Common Stock) remained outstanding after the Earnout Transaction and were no longer subject to forfeiture.

 Revenue 
 Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 declined when compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower average revenue per member per month ARPM in our Consumer business. Revenue growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year period was driven by the continued scaling of our Institutional business, partially offset by lower ARPM in our Consumer business. ARPM was lower in both current year periods due to a higher mix of lower frequency Learning Memberships when compared to the prior year periods. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included legacy Package revenue of 15,850 thousand that did not recur in the current year period due to the completion of the transition to Learning Memberships in our Consumer business. 
 The following table presents our revenue by business category for the periods presented.

 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
 The following table sets forth our cost of revenue and gross profit for the periods presented. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change dollars in thousands 
 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue 37,530 40,296 (2,766) (7) 142,241 138,315 3,926 3 Cost of revenue 11,077 11,108 31 45,786 41,138 (4,648) (11) Gross Profit 26,453 29,188 (2,735) (9) 96,455 97,177 (722) (1) Margin 70 72 68 70 
 Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was flat year over year. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to higher Expert costs of 4,095 thousand, primarily related to higher utilization of tutoring sessions across Learning Memberships in our Consumer business and the continued scaling of our Institutional business. 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 26,453 thousand decreased by 2,735 thousand, or 9 , compared to the same period in 2023. Gross margin was 70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gross margin of 72 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 96,455 thousand decreased by 722 thousand, or 1 , compared to the same period in 2023. Gross margin was 68 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gross margin of 70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower ARPM coupled with higher utilization of tutoring sessions across Learning Memberships in our Consumer business, partially offset by lower seasonal utilization of our access-based products in our Institutional business. The decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower ARPM coupled with higher utilization of tutoring sessions across Learning Memberships in our Consumer business and higher substitution costs in our Institutional business. Recently introduced improvements to our marketplace infrastructure systems, including session scheduling enhancements, invoice automation improvements, and changes to the tutor substitution program logic, collectively are expected to drive gross margin improvement on a go-forward basis, while simultaneously improving the customer experience due to the higher reliability level of our marketplace infrastructure systems. 
 Operating Expenses 
 The following table sets forth our operating expenses for the periods presented. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change dollars in thousands 
 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sales and marketing expenses 20,315 19,233 1,082 6 53,244 49,652 3,592 7 General and administrative expenses 31,862 35,508 (3,646) (10) 97,017 94,921 2,096 2 Total operating expenses 52,177 54,741 (2,564) (5) 150,261 144,573 5,688 4 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included stock-based compensation of 556 thousand and 695 thousand, respectively. Excluding these impacts in both periods, sales and marketing expenses increased 1,221 thousand, or 7 . Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included stock-based compensation of 1,729 thousand and 2,224 thousand, respectively. Excluding these impacts in both periods, sales and marketing expenses increased 4,087 thousand, or 9 . 
 Sales and marketing increases were driven by investments in our Institutional sales organization which were made to drive customer acquisition, brand awareness, and reach, including through signing up school districts with free access to the Varsity Tutors platform, which is a strategy to introduce school districts to the platform and ultimately convert them to our fee-based offerings. These investments were partially offset by Consumer marketing efficiency gains.

 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses include compensation for certain employees, support services, product and development expenses intended to support continued innovation, and other operating expenses. Product and development costs were 11,273 thousand and 10,085 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 1,188 thousand. Product and development costs were 33,505 thousand and 26,907 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 6,598 thousand. Product and development costs include compensation for employees on our product and engineering teams who are responsible for developing new and improving existing offerings, maintaining our website, improving efficiencies across our organization, and third-party expenses. 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included non-cash stock based compensation of 9,256 thousand. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included non-cash stock based compensation, costs related to the warrant and earnout transactions, restructuring costs, and a provision for legal settlement of 10,927 thousand, 1,940 thousand , 841 thousand , and 1,250 thousand, respectively. Excluding these impacts in both periods, general and administrative expenses increased 2,056 thousand, or 10 . 
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included non-cash stock based compensation of 30,509 thousand. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included non-cash stock based compensation, costs related to the warrant and earnout transactions, restructuring costs, and a provision for legal settlement of 30,578 thousand, 1,940 thousand , 841 thousand , and 1,250 thousand, respectively. Excluding these impacts in both periods, general and administrative expenses increased 6,196 thousand, or 10 . 
 We believe our investments in product development and our platform-oriented approach to growth have allowed us to launch and continuously improve our suite of always on subscription products, including Learning Memberships for Consumers, and our District, Teacher, and Parent Assigned offerings for Institutional customers. We believe these subscription and access-based offerings simplify our operating model needed to support the organization, which allows us to maximize our investment in our unified platform. 
 Unrealized (Gain) Loss on Derivatives, Net 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a (gain) loss of (4,099) thousand and 13,385 thousand, respectively, related to non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on our warrants and earnouts prior to the warrant and earnout transactions. Of the net gain recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2023, 5,010 thousand and (9,109) thousand related to warrants and earnouts, respectively. Of the loss recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 11,091 thousand and 2,294 thousand related to warrants and earnouts, respectively. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 768 thousand, a decrease from 844 thousand in the same period in 2023, driven by lower interest income on our cash balances during the current year period. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,533 thousand, an increase from 2,460 thousand in the same period in 2023, driven by higher interest income on our cash balances during the current year period. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 65,002 thousand and 74,824 thousand, respectively. We have incurred cumulative losses from our operations, and we may incur additional losses in the future. Our operations have historically been financed primarily through cash on hand and capital contributions. To the extent we generate negative operating cash flows, it is possible that we may have to finance future operations primarily or in part from cash on hand. 
 Cash Requirements 
 Our cash requirements within the next twelve months include working capital requirements, sales and marketing activities, and capital expenditures. We believe our cash on hand will be sufficient to satisfy these future requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no debt obligations. Our cash requirements under our contractual obligations and commitments consist primarily of lease arrangements. For information on our lease obligations and the amount and timing of future payments, see Note 17 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to our leasing arrangements previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report.

 (10,006) (7,000) 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1,773 thousand when compared to the same period in 2023 as investments in our Institutional sales organization and product development to drive innovation and support our continued growth were partially offset by favorable changes in working capital primarily related to fluctuations in the timing of sales and collections of receivables and the payments of other current liabilities. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 5,700 thousand and 3,923 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash used in investing activities for both periods related to capital expenditures primarily for the development of internal use software and IT equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 567 thousand, which related to transaction costs paid in connection with the warrant and earnout transactions. We did not have any financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 CAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements in this report may constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the federal securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions, or strategies regarding the future, including our expectations with respect to: enhancing the Learning Membership experience; continued improvements in sales and marketing leverage; the growth of our Institutional business; changes to our marketplace infrastructure systems; simplifying our operations model while growing our business; and the sufficiency of our cash to fund future operations. Any statements that refer to projections, forecasts, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipates, approximately, believes, contemplates, continues, could, estimates, expects, intends, may, might, outlook, plans, possible, potential, predicts, projects, should, seeks, will, would, and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including: 
 our limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict our future financial and operating results; 
 our history of net losses; 
 risks associated with our ability to acquire and retain customers, operate, and scale up our Consumer and Institutional businesses; 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 risks associated with our intellectual property, including claims that we infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights; 
 risks associated with our classification of some individuals and entities we contract with as independent contractors; 
 risks associated with the liquidity and trading of our securities; 
 risks associated with payments that we may be required to make under the tax receivable agreement; 
 litigation, regulatory, and reputational risks arising from the fact that many of our Learners are minors; 
 changes in applicable laws or regulations; 
 the possibility of cyber-related incidents and their related impacts on our business and results of operations; 
 risks associated with the development and use of artificial intelligence and related regulatory uncertainty; 
 the possibility that we may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; 
 risks associated with managing our rapid growth; and 
 other risks and uncertainties included under Risk Factors within Part II, Item 1A of this report and in our 2023 Annual Report filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors elsewhere in this report. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC that disclose risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We cannot assure you that the results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY STATUS 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We expect to remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of TPG Pace Tech Opportunities initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1,235,000 thousand, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds 700,000 thousand as of the prior June 30 or (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1,000,000 thousand in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.

Table of Contents 

 SMALLER REPORTING COMPANY STATUS 
 As of December 31, 2023, we were no longer a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. An entity is a smaller reporting company based upon the following criteria: (i) the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250,000 thousand as of the prior June 30, or (ii) our annual revenues are less than 100,000 thousand during the prior fiscal year and the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700,000 thousand as of the prior June 30. 
 According to 5120.1b of the SEC Financial Reporting Manual, once we fail to qualify for smaller reporting company status, we will remain unqualified until making a subsequent determination either: (i) our public float falls below 200,000 thousand as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (ii) our public float and annual revenues meet certain other requirements for subsequent qualification as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. Based upon the facts and circumstances that existed as of June 30, 2024, we have re-entered smaller reporting company status and will use scaled disclosures in future reports, as applicable, permitted for a smaller reporting company. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 Our exposure to market risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates are immaterial. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO of the Company, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no significant changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION. 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 For information regarding our legal proceedings, refer to Note 14 within Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item 1 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 For disclosure of environmental proceedings with a governmental entity as a party pursuant to Item 103(c)(3)(iii) of Regulation S-K, we have elected to disclose matters where we reasonably believe such proceeding would result in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of 1,000 thousand or more. Applying this threshold, there are no such environmental proceedings to disclose as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 In addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report ), you should carefully consider the risk factors we previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ), filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. As of the date of the Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. However, these risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
