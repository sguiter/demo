CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current expectations and views of future events. The forward-looking statements are
contained principally in the sections entitled Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. Readers are cautioned that known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including
those over which we may have no control and others listed in the Risk Factors section of this Report, may cause our actual
results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
statements by the words may, might, will, could, would, should, 
 expect, intend, plan, objective, anticipate, believe, 
 estimate, predict, project, potential, continue and ongoing, 
or the negative of these terms, or other comparable terminology intended to identify statements about the future, although not all forward-looking
statements contain these words. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance or condition and involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievement
to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but
are not limited to, statements about: 

our
financial position and estimated cash burn rate; 

our
estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, and capital requirements; 

our
ability to continue as a going concern; 

our
need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and repay indebtedness; 

our
ability to commercialize or monetize Proclarix and integrate the assets and commercial operations acquired in the share exchange with
Proteomedix AG Proteomedix 

our reliance on third parties, including Laboratory Corporation of
America LabCorp ), to develop, market, distribute and sell our products; 

the
successful development of our commercialization capabilities, including sales and marketing capabilities; 

our ability to maintain the necessary regulatory approvals to market and commercialize our products; 

the results of market research conducted by us or others; 

our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our current products; 

our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the potential for us to incur substantial costs from lawsuits to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights; 

ii 

the possibility that a third party may claim we or our third-party licensors have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights and that we may incur substantial costs and be required to devote substantial time defending against claims against us; 

our reliance on third parties, including manufacturers and logistics
 companies; 

the success of competing therapies or diagnostics and products that are or become available; 

our ability to successfully compete against current and future competitors; 

our ability to expand our organization to accommodate potential growth and our ability to motivate, retain, and attract key personnel; 

the potential for us to incur substantial costs resulting from product liability lawsuits against us and the potential for these product liability lawsuits to cause us to limit our commercialization of our products; 

market acceptance of our products, the size and growth of the potential markets for our current products, and our ability to serve those markets; and 

disruptions in the business of Onconetix or Proteomedix, which could have an adverse effect on their respective businesses and financial results. 

These forward-looking statements involve numerous
risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that our expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations
may later be found to be incorrect. Our actual results of operations or the results of other matters that we anticipate herein could be
materially different from our expectations. Important risks and factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different
from our expectations are generally set forth in Risk Factors, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, and other sections in this Report. You should thoroughly read this Report and the documents
that we refer to with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from and worse than what we expect.
We qualify all our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 

The forward-looking statements made in this Report
relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this Report. Except as required by law, we undertake
no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise,
after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this Report and
the documents that we refer to in this Report and have filed as exhibits to this Report, completely and with the understanding that our
actual future results may be materially different from what we expect.

of the issued and outstanding voting equity interests in Proteomedix AG, a Swiss company Proteomedix or PMX ),
and its related diagnostic product Proclarix. As a result of this transaction, Proteomedix became a wholly owned subsidiary of Onconetix
(see Note 5). Proteomedix is a healthcare company whose mission is to transform prostate cancer diagnosis. Proteomedix has identified
novel biomarker signatures with utility in prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy management. 

In April 2023, the Company acquired ENTADFI, a
Food and Drug Administration FDA )-approved, once daily pill that combines finasteride and tadalafil for the treatment of
benign prostatic hyperplasia. 

Historically, the Company s focus was on
the research and development of transformational vaccines to prevent infectious diseases worldwide, until the third quarter of 2023, at
which time the Company halted its efforts on vaccine development activities to focus on commercialization activities for ENTADFI and pursue
other potential acquisitions. However, in light of (i) the time and resources needed to continue pursuing commercialization of ENTADFI,
and (ii) the Company s cash runway and indebtedness, the Company determined to pause its commercialization of ENTADFI during the
first quarter of 2024, as it explores strategic alternatives to monetize ENTADFI, such as a potential sale of the ENTADFI assets. To that
end, the Company is working with an investment advisor to assist with the potential sale or other transaction of the ENTADFI assets. There
is currently no plan to resume commercialization of ENTADFI, and as such, if the Company is not able to consummate a sale or other transaction
of the ENTADFI assets, it may abandon the assets and destroy its inventory of the product. Based on the circumstances surrounding ENTADFI,
the ENTADFI assets were fully impaired at June 30, 2024 (see Notes 4 and 5). 

Reverse Stock Split 

On September 24, 2024, The Company accounted
for the reverse stock split on a retrospective basis pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ASC 260, Earnings Per Share . All issued and outstanding common stock, common stock warrants, and share-based
awards exercise prices and per share data have been adjusted in these condensed consolidated financial statements, on a retrospective basis,
to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. The number of authorized shares and par value of the
preferred stock and common stock were not adjusted because of the reverse stock split. 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

The Company s condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP and include the accounts of Onconetix and its wholly owned subsidiary, Proteomedix, since the acquisition date of December
15, 2023. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The non-controlling interest recorded
in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 relates to currently outstanding stock-based awards
issued by Proteomedix, which were assumed by Onconetix in connection with the acquisition of Proteomedix (see Note 5). 

Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements 

The accompanying condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of September 30, 2024, and the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and the condensed consolidated
statements of convertible redeemable preferred stock and stockholders equity (deficit) for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited.
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements,
and in management s opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement
of the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2024 and its results of operations and comprehensive loss for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The financial
data and the other financial information disclosed in the notes to these condensed consolidated financial statements related to the three
and nine-month periods are also unaudited. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, any other interim periods, or any future year
or period. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, which includes a broader discussion of the Company s business and the risks inherent therein.

million, a working capital deficit of approximately million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 
million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used approximately million in cash for operating activities.
In addition, as of December 5, 2024, the Company s cash balance was approximately million, all of which is currently
held by the Company s foreign subsidiary. The Company s current cash balance is not sufficient to fund its operations through
the end of December 2024 until it can utilize the Equity Financing Line of Credit ELOC ), which it entered into on
October 2, 2024, referred herein as the ELOC Purchase Agreement, and this raises substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.
The Company s projections are also indicative that it will be unable to meet its contractual commitments and obligations as they
come due in the ordinary course of business. The Company will require significant additional capital in the short-term to fund its continuing
operations, satisfy existing and future obligations and liabilities, including the remaining payments due for the acquisition of the ENTADFI
assets, and funds needed to support the Company s working capital needs and business activities. These business activities include
the commercialization of Proclarix, and the development and commercialization of the Company s future product candidates. 

Management s
plans for funding the Company s operations include generating product revenue from sales of Proclarix, which is still subject to
further successful development and commercialization activities within certain jurisdictions. Management also intends to secure additional
required funding through equity or debt financings if available, and to utilize the ELOC entered into in October 2024 (see Note 15) on
an as-needed basis to assist with the paydown of notes issued to Veru and to fund current operating needs, subject to certain restrictions
and beneficial ownership constraints. However, based on the terms of the ELOC and the current maximum availability, Management determined
that the funds readily available under the ELOC will not be sufficient to sustain operations. In addition, there are currently no other
commitments in place for further financing nor is there any assurance that such financing will be available to the Company on favorable
terms, if at all. This creates significant uncertainty whether the Company will have the funds available to be able to sustain its operations
and expand commercialization of Proclarix. If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, it may be required to curtail any future
clinical trials, development and/or commercialization of future product candidates, and it may take additional measures to reduce expenses
in order to conserve its cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet its obligations. 

Because of historical and expected operating losses
and net operating cash flow deficits, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for
one year from the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements, which is not alleviated by management s plans. The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. These condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Intangible assets, net 

The finite lived intangible assets held by the
Company, which includes customer relationships and product rights for developed technology, are being amortized over their estimated useful
lives of years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was approximately and for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Of the total amortization expense, approximately and was recorded as selling,
general, and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and approximately 
and was recorded as cost of revenue, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, in the accompanying
condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2024,
the Company became aware of a new competitor that received approval by the FDA for a combined finasteride-tadalafil capsule, which is
a direct competitor product to ENTADFI. This was determined to be a triggering event that could result in a decrease in future expected
cash flows, and thus indicated the carrying amount of the ENTADFI asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company performed an undiscounted
cash flow analysis over the ENTADFI asset group and determined that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable. The Company
then estimated the fair value of the asset group to measure the impairment loss for the period. Significant assumptions used to determine
this non-recurring fair value measurement included projected sales driven by market share and product sales price estimates, associated
expenses, growth rates, the discount rate used to measure the fair value of the net cash flows associated with this asset group, as well
as Management s estimates of an expected sales price for the asset group, and the probability of each potential strategic alternative
taking place. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the
Company reevaluated the probability of each potential strategic alternative occurring and determined that the change in probabilities
is a triggering event that could result in a decrease in future expected cash flows, and thus indicated the carrying amount of the ENTADFI
asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company further determined that the asset group was fully impaired at June 30, 2024, and
recorded a corresponding impairment charge during the three months ended June 30, 2024, thus resulting in no remaining carrying value
for the assets in the ENTADFI asset group. 

The Company recorded no impairment charges on
its intangible assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 
million and approximately million were allocated to the product rights intangible asset and prepaids and other assets, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average
remaining amortization period for intangible assets was approximately years. 

Trade names, which do not have legal, regulatory,
contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors that limit the useful lives are considered indefinite lived assets and are not amortized
but are tested for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these
assets may not be recoverable. The Company tested its trade name for impairment during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a
result of certain triggering events discussed below. The Company determined that there was no impairment of its trade name as of September
30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million of intangible assets relate to a trade name that has been identified
as having an indefinite life. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill was recorded during the year ended December

million. 

Historically, the Company was organized in two reporting units,
Proteomedix and ENTADFI. The goodwill arising from the Proteomedix acquisition was assigned solely to the Proteomedix reporting unit.
The Company reevaluated its reporting units during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and determined that as of April 30, 2024, ENTADFI
no longer qualified as a separate reporting unit. As a result, since that date, the Company s goodwill is assigned to a single reporting
unit. Accordingly, the Company performed a quantitative analysis immediately prior to the change in reporting units, and immediately after
the change in reporting units, to identify and measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized, if any. To perform its quantitative
tests, the Company compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and determined that the fair value of the reporting
unit was less than its carrying value. The Company determined the amount of impairment charges to its goodwill for the three months ended
June 30, 2024 to be approximately million. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company s re-evaluation of market conditions and anticipated timing of projected sales prompted the Company to determine that
there was an indicator of a potential impairment of its related intangible assets and goodwill, and accordingly, as of September 30, 2024,
the Company performed a quantitative analysis to identify and measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized, if any. It was determined
no further impairment on goodwill was required for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company has recorded a cumulative million
in impairment charges related to its goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The fair value estimate of the reporting units for the quarter ended
March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was derived from a combination of an income approach and a market approach, and a reconciliation to the
Company s market capitalization. The fair value estimate of the reporting units for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was derived
solely from the income approach. The method was changed for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to reflect the disparity between the
Company and the guideline transactions that were previously selected in prior quarters. Under the income approach, the Company estimated
the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, which the Company considers to be a Level
3 unobservable input in the fair value hierarchy. The Company prepared cash flow projections based on management s estimates of
future revenue and operating costs, taking into consideration the historical performance and the current macroeconomic, industry, and
market conditions. The Company based the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital considering Company-specific characteristics
and changes in the reporting unit s projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimated the fair value of the
reporting unit based on revenue market multiples derived from comparable companies with similar characteristics as the reporting unit,
as well as an estimated control premium.

In accordance with the Veru APA, the Company agreed
to provide Veru with initial consideration totaling million, consisting of 

Additionally, the terms of the Veru APA require
the Company to pay Veru up to an additional million based on the Company s net sales of ENTADFI after closing (the Milestone
Payments ). The Milestone Payments are payable as follows: 

In connection with the Transaction, the Company
also assumed royalty and milestone obligations under an asset purchase agreement for tadalafil-finasteride combination entered into
by Veru and Camargo Pharmaceutical Services, LLC on December 11, 2017 (the Camargo Obligations ). The Camargo Obligations
assumed by the Company include a royalty on all sales of tadalafil-finasteride and sales milestone payments of up to million,
payable to Camargo as follows: 

On September 29, 2023, the Company entered into
an amendment to the Veru APA (the Veru APA Amendment ), which provides that the million note payable originally due
on was deemed paid and fully satisfied upon 

On April 24, 2024, the Company entered into a
Forbearance Agreement with Veru in connection with the Company s default on the million non-interest-bearing note payable that
was due on April 19, 2024 (see Note 7). 

On September 19, 2024, the Company entered into
an Amended and Restated Forbearance Agreement with Veru, which further modified the terms of both the April and September Veru notes outstanding
(see Note 7). 

Also, in connection with, and at the time of the
Transaction, and pursuant to the Veru APA, the Company entered into non-competition and non-solicitation agreements (the Non-Competition
Agreements with two of Veru s key stockholders and employees (the Restricted Parties ). The Non-Competition
Agreements generally prohibit the Restricted Parties from either directly or indirectly engaging in the Restricted Business (as such term
is defined in the Veru APA) for a period of five years from the closing of the Transaction. 

The acquisition of ENTADFI was accounted
for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50 because substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated
in a single asset, the ENTADFI product rights. The ENTADFI products rights consist of trademarks, regulatory approvals, and other records,
and are considered a single asset as they are inextricably linked.

to the face value of the notes, through the respective maturity dates. Management evaluated the Milestone Payments and determined that
at the close of the Transaction, they are not considered probable, and as such, the Company did not recognize any amount related to the

Total fair value of identifiable assets acquired 

In accordance with ASC 805-50, the acquired inventory
was recorded at fair value. The remaining consideration transferred was allocated to the ENTADFI intangible asset, which was to be amortized
over its estimated useful life, which was expected to begin upon launch of ENTADFI. Acquired inventory is comprised of work-in-process
and raw materials. The fair value of work-in-process inventory was determined based on an estimated sales price of the finished goods,
adjusted for costs to complete the manufacturing process, costs of the selling effort, a reasonable profit allowance for the
remaining manufacturing and selling effort, and an estimate of holding costs, and resulted in a fair value adjustment of approximately
 million. The fair value of raw materials was determined to approximate replacement cost. 

The Company recorded an impairment charge on the
ENTADFI asset group of approximately million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (see Note 4), and an impairment charge
on the ENTADFI inventory of approximately million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, during the fourth
quarter of 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million on the ENTADFI asset group, as well as an impairment
charge on the ENTADFI acquired inventory of approximately million, which included impairment of of the acquired work-in-process
inventory.

Note 5 Acquisitions (cont.) 

In conjunction with the WraSer APA, the Company
and the WraSer Seller entered into a Management Services Agreement (the MSA on the Execution Date. Pursuant to the terms
of the MSA, the Company would act as the manager of the WraSer Seller s business during the period between the Execution Date and
the WraSer Closing Date. During this period, the Company would make advances to WraSer, if needed. If, on the WraSer Closing Date, the
WraSer Seller s cash balance is in excess of the target amount Cash Target specified in the MSA, the Company would
apply that excess to the million cash payment due upon closing. Conversely, if there is a shortfall, the Company would be required
to remit the difference to the WraSer Seller over time. 

The WraSer APA could be terminated prior to the
closing upon agreement with all parties or upon breach of contract of either party, uncured within 20 days of notice. If the WraSer APA
was terminated upon agreement with all parties or upon uncured breach of contract by the Company, the initial million payment would
be retained by the WraSer Seller. If it were determined that there is an uncured breach of contract by the WraSer Seller, and the WraSer
APA was terminated, the Company would have an unsecured claim against WraSer for the million payment made by the Company upon execution
of the WraSer APA. The closing of the transaction was subject to certain customary closing conditions, including submission of the FDA
transfer documentation to transfer ownership of the acquired product regulatory approvals to the Company. 

Management evaluated the terms of the WraSer APA
and the WraSer MSA, and determined that, at the Execution Date, control under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations ASC
805 ), did not transfer to the Company; if the transaction closes, control will transfer then, and the acquisition date will be
the closing date. Management further evaluated the requirements pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidations , and determined based on the
terms of the MSA, and the Company s involvement in the WraSer Seller s business, that the WraSer Seller is a variable interest
entity VIE to the Company. Management determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE as the WraSer
APA and MSA do not provide the Company with the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s
economic performance. While the Company was involved in the day-to-day business activities of the VIE until WraSer filed for relief under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court (see below), the WraSer Seller had to approve substantially all business activities and transactions
that significantly impact the economic performance of WraSer during the term of the MSA. Additionally, the Company is not required to
absorb the losses of WraSer if the WraSer APA does not close. As such, the Company was not required to consolidate WraSer in the Company s
financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The Company recorded the initial million
payment as a deposit. The Company does not have any liabilities recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 associated with
its variable interest in the WraSer Seller, and its exposure to the WraSer Seller s losses is limited to no more than the shortfall,
if any, of the Cash Target amount of approximately million compared to the WraSer Seller s cash balance on the WraSer Closing
Date.

In October 2023, WraSer alerted the Company
that its sole manufacturer for the active pharmaceutical ingredient API for Zontivity, the key driver for the WraSer acquisition,
would no longer manufacture the API for Zontivity. The Company believes that this development constituted a Material Adverse Effect under
the WraSer APA and the WraSer MSA, enabling the Company to terminate the WraSer APA and the WraSer MSA. On October 20, 2023, the Company
filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay in the Bankruptcy Court so that the Company can exercise the termination rights under
the WraSer APA, as amended. On December 18, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered into an Agreed Order lifting the automatic stay to
enable the Company to exercise its rights to terminate the WraSer APA and the WraSer MSA. On December 21, 2023, the Company
filed a Notice with the Bankruptcy Court terminating the WraSer APA and the WraSer MSA. WraSer has advised the Company that it does not
believe that a Material Adverse Effect occurred. In addition, WraSer recently filed a plan of reorganization that indicates it may seek
damages from the Company due to the termination of the APA and MSA. Due to the WraSer bankruptcy filing and the Company s status
as an unsecured creditor of WraSer, it is unlikely that the Company will recover the million initial payment made, or any costs and
resources in connection with services provided by the Company under the WraSer MSA, and therefore the Company recorded a loss on impairment
for the million deposit during the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Proteomedix 

On December 15, 2023 (the Acquisition Date ),
Onconetix entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement with Proteomedix and each of the holders

pursuant to which the Company acquired of the outstanding common shares and voting interest of Proteomedix, through the issuance

of Onconetix at the Special Meeting of the Stockholders Stockholder Approval ), each share of Series B Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock Series B Preferred Stock was automatically convertible into shares of common stock in accordance with
the terms of the Series B Certificate of Designation (the Conversion ). If Stockholder Approval was not obtained by January
1, 2025, Onconetix was, at the option of the holders, obligated to cash settle the Series B Preferred Stock at the option of the holders.
The Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as a result of the PMX Transaction was convertible into shares of common stock. Stockholder
Approval was obtained on September 5, 2024 and the Conversion occurred subsequently on September 24, 2024 (see Note 9).

was utilized in determining the fair value of this intangible asset. The fair value of this asset was determined based on a cash flow
model using forecasted revenues and expenses specifically tied to Proclarix . Those cash flows were then discounted at determined
by the use of a weighted average return on assets analysis. The life of this intangible asset was determined to be indefinite as the branded
name will persist beyond the life of the product rights and customer relationships. 

The customer relationship intangible assets represent
the value of the existing customer contract with LabCorp (see Note 6) and was valued using the lost profits method under the income approach.
The fair value of this asset was determined based on a cash flow model using forecasted revenues specifically tied to Proteomedix s
LabCorp contract. Those cash flows were then discounted at determined by the use of a weighted average return on assets analysis.
The estimated useful life of this asset was determined by reference to the estimated life of the product rights associated with the LabCorp
contract. 

The product rights for developed technology acquired
in the PMX Transaction represents know-how and patented intellectual property held by PMX pertaining to its commercial-ready prostate
cancer diagnostic system, Proclarix . The fair value of this asset was determined based on a cash flow model based on forecasted
revenues and expenses specifically tied to Proclarix . Those cash flows were then discounted at for the period prior to patent
expiration and for the period thereafter. The discount rates were determined by the use of a weighted average return on assets analysis.
The estimated useful life of the product rights was determined based on the underlying patent s remaining life. 

The fair value of the non-controlling interest
in Proteomedix is estimated to be million and represents the fair value of the vested Proteomedix stock options outstanding as of
the Acquisition Date. The fair value of the non-controlling interest was valued using the methodology applicable to the Proteomedix stock
options disclosed above. As Proteomedix was a private company as of the Acquisition Date, the fair value measurement is based on significant
inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement .

Laboratory Corporation of America 

On March 23, 2023, Proteomedix entered into a license agreement with
LabCorp, pursuant to which LabCorp has the exclusive right to develop and commercialize Proclarix, and other products developed by LabCorp
using Proteomedix s intellectual property covered by the license, in the United States Licensed Products ). In consideration
for granting LabCorp an exclusive license, Proteomedix received an initial license fee in the mid-six figures upon signing of the contract.
Additionally, Proteomedix is entitled to royalty payments of between and on the net sales recognized by LabCorp of any Licensed
Products plus milestone payments as follows: 

After
the first sale of Proclarix as a laboratory developed test, LabCorp will pay an amount in the mid-six figures, 

after
LabCorp achieves a certain amount in the low seven figures in net sales of Licensed Products, LabCorp will pay Proteomedix an amount
in the low seven figures, 

after
a certain amount in the mid-seven figures in net sales of Licensed Products, LabCorp will pay Proteomedix an amount in the low seven
figures. 

The total available milestone payments available
under the terms of this contract is million. An additional million was paid to Proteomedix as an initial license fee in 2023. 

LabCorp is wholly responsible for the cost, if
any, of research, development and commercialization of Licensed Products in the United States but has the right to offset a portion of
those costs against future royalty and milestone payments. Additionally, LabCorp may deduct royalties or other payments made to third
parties related to the manufacture or sale of Licensed Products up to a maximum amount of any royalty payments due to Proteomedix. 

The license agreement and related royalty payment
provisions expire during 2038, which approximates the expiration of the last patent covered by the license agreement. LabCorp has the
right to terminate the license agreement for any reason by providing 90 days written notice to Proteomedix. Either party may terminate
the license agreement due to a material breach of the terms of the license agreement with 30 days notice, provided such breach
is not cured within the foregoing 30-day period. Finally, Proteomedix may terminate the license agreement with 60 days notice in
the event LabCorp fails to make any undisputed payment due, provided that LabCorp does not remit the payment within the foregoing 60-day
period. 

As of September 30, 2024, the sale of Licensed
Products by LabCorp under the license agreement has not commenced. The Company has sold product to LabCorp for their use in internal trials
of the test.

accordance with the Notes, no principal payments are due until maturity; however, the Company may voluntarily prepay the Notes with no
penalty. Additionally, in an Event of Default, as defined in the Notes, the unpaid principal amount of the Notes will accrue interest
at a rate of per annum. 

The Company imputed interest on the Notes using
an average discount rate of and recorded a debt discount of approximately million at the issuance date. The debt discount is
reflected as a reduction in the carrying amount of the Notes and amortized to interest expense through the respective maturity dates,
using the effective interest method. 

On September 29, 2023, the Company and the note
holder entered into an amendment to the Veru APA, which provided that the million note payable originally due on 
was deemed paid and fully satisfied upon (1) the payment to the Seller of million in cash on September 29, 2023, and (2) the issuance
to the Seller by October 3, 2023 of shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company. In connection with the Veru APA Amendment,
the Company recorded an extinguishment loss on the note payable of approximately during the year ended December 31, 2023, which
represented the difference between the fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock that was issued to settle the debt and the carrying
value of the note payable as of September 29, 2023. Pursuant to the Veru APA Amendment, the Series A Preferred Stock would convert to
common stock of the Company from the date of issuance if the required stockholder approval was obtained. The Series A Preferred
Stock, which was issued to the Seller on October 3, 2023 was initially convertible, in the aggregate, into shares of the Company s
common stock, subject to adjustment and certain stockholder approval limitations specified in the Certificate of Designations. Stockholder
approval was obtained during September 2024 and therefore subsequent conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock to common stock was consummated
by the Company during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (see Note 9). The Company also agreed to include the shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock in the next resale registration statement filed with the SEC. To that end, the
Company registered shares of common stock, out of the shares issued to Veru, in a registration statement filed with the
SEC on November 1, 2024. 

On April 24, 2024, the Company entered into
a forbearance agreement with Veru (the Original Forbearance Agreement due to the Company s failure to repay the principal
balance on the million note payable that had a maturity date of (the April Veru Note ). Pursuant to the
Original Forbearance Agreement, Veru will forbear from exercising its rights and remedies under the April Veru Note as a result of this

Interest will accrue on any unpaid principal balance
of the April Veru Note at a rate of per annum, commencing on April 20, 2024 through the date that the outstanding principal balance

events of default under the April Veru Note or the million note payable that matures on (the September
Veru Note ), (ii) a payment default under the September Veru Note and (iii) the final payment of any principal amount payable under
the September Veru Note. No interest was to accrue under the September Veru Note during the April 2024 Forbearance Period unless an Event
of Default (as defined in the Original Forbearance Agreement) occurs, in which case interest will accrue from and after the date on which
such default occurs. 

In consideration for Veru s entrance into
the Original Forbearance Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Veru: 

of the principal due under the April Veru Note, which was paid on April 25, 2024, and up to of out-of-pocket expenses incurred

or any of its subsidiaries for milestone payments or royalties from LabCorp; and

2025. 

The Company also agreed to a general release of
claims against Veru and its representatives arising out of or relating to any act or omission thereof prior to April 24, 2024. 

The Company determined that the Original Forbearance
Agreement should be accounted for as a modification of the April Veru Note and the September Veru Note in accordance with ASC
470-50, Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments ASC 470 ), as the change in cash flows expected under the April
Veru Note and the September Veru Note was not substantial. A new effective interest rate was established based on the carrying value of
the original Notes and the revised cash flows and no gain or loss was recorded.

Future minimum principal payments on the Notes

Related Party Debenture 

On January 23, 2024, the Company issued a non-convertible
debenture (the Debenture to the PMX Investor, a related party, in the principal sum of million, in connection with
the Subscription Agreement discussed in Note 8. The Debenture has an interest rate of per annum, and the principal and accrued interest
was originally payable in full upon the earlier of (i) the closing under the Subscription Agreement and (ii) June 30, 2024. Additionally,
the million subscription amount under the Subscription Agreement shall be increased by the amount of interest payable under the Debenture. 

On April 24, 2024, the maturity date of the related
party debenture was extended to October 31, 2024, through the execution of an extension agreement (the Extension Agreement between the Company and the PMX investor. No other terms of the Debenture were modified in connection with the Extension Agreement. 

The Company considered the guidance of ASC 470-60,
 Troubled Debt Restructuring by Debtors , and concluded that the Extension Agreement should be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring
as the Company is experiencing financial difficulty and since the effective borrowing rate under the Extension Agreement is less than
the effective borrowing rate under the original agreement, which indicates that a concession is deemed to have been granted. This did
not result in a gain on restructuring as the future undiscounted cash outflows required under the Extension Agreement exceed the carrying
value of the Debenture immediately prior to the extension. A new effective rate was established based on the carrying value of the original
Debenture and the revised cash flows. 

In connection with the issuance of the Debenture,
the Company incurred approximately million in financing fees, which was recorded as a debt discount, and reflected as a reduction
in the carrying amount of the Debenture. The debt discount is being amortized to interest expense through the maturity date. The Company
did not incur any financing fees in connection with the Extension Agreement. 

On September 24, 2024, the Company converted all
unpaid principal and accrued interest due under the Debenture into units, attributable to principal, and units, attributable
to accrued interest, upon the closing of the Subscription Agreement. Each unit consisted of 1 share of common stock and pre-funded
warrants at an exercise price of per share. As a result of the transaction, shares of common stock were issued, and 
pre-funded warrants were issued. As of September 30, 2024, there is no outstanding balance or accrued interest remaining on the Debenture.
The remaining unamortized debt discount was immediately expensed upon settlement. 

The Company recorded approximately million
and million of interest expense on the Debenture during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which includes
accrued interest and amortization of the debt discount.

270 days after such closing. The Subscription Agreement would only close upon obtaining Stockholder Approval for certain transactions
involving the Company s Series B Preferred Stock, as further described in Note 5. The Subscription Agreement was amended on January
23, 2024 to include a provision for interest on the million debenture, accruing at a rate of , to be included in the calculation

The Subscription Agreement is accounted for as

upon Stockholder Approval as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designation. 

The Company evaluated the terms of the Series
B Preferred Stock, and in accordance with the guidance of ASC 480, the Series B Preferred Stock was classified as temporary equity in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as the shares may be redeemable by the holders for cash, upon certain conditions that are
not within the control of the Company. Additionally, the Company does not control the actions or events necessary to deliver the number
of required shares upon exercise by the holders of the conversion feature. The Series B Preferred Stock was recorded at its fair value
as of the issuance date (see Note 5). The Series B Preferred Stock was not previously redeemable or probable of becoming redeemable because
it was subject to, among other things, Stockholder Approval as described above, and therefore the carrying amount was not accreted to
its redemption value in prior periods. 

On September 5, 2024, Stockholder Approval was
obtained, and on September 24, 2024, the Company effected the conversion of all shares of Series B Preferred Stock into

Warrant Inducements: 

July 2024 Inducement 

On July 11, 2024, the Company entered into common
stock preferred investment options exercise inducement offer letters (the Inducement Letters with certain holders of existing
preferred investment options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at the original exercise prices of and 
per share, issued on August 11, 2022 and August 2, 2023, respectively (collectively, the Existing PIOs ), pursuant to which
the holders agreed to exercise for cash their Existing PIOs to purchase an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock,
at a reduced exercise price of per share, in consideration for the Company s agreement to issue new preferred investment options
(the Inducement PIOs to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock. Of the 
PIOs issued, have a contractual term of years, while the remaining have a contractual term of years. Aside from the
contractual terms, the Inducement PIOs have substantially the same terms as the Existing PIOs. 

On July 11, 2024, the Company consummated the
transaction contemplated by the Inducement Letters upon unanimous written consent of the Board of Directors (the Warrant Inducement ).
The Company received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million from the Warrant Inducement, after deducting placement agent
fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. 

The Company agreed to file a registration statement
covering the resale of the Inducement PIO Shares issued or issuable upon the exercise of the Inducement PIOs (the Resale Registration
Statement within days after the date of the Inducement Letter and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Resale
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC within days following the date of the Inducement Letter (or within days
following the date of the Inducement Letter in the case of full review of the Resale Registration Statement by the SEC). 

The Company engaged H.C. Wainwright Co.,
LLC Wainwright to act as its exclusive placement agent in connection with the transactions summarized herein and paid
Wainwright a cash fee equal to of the gross proceeds received form the exercise of the Existing PIOs as well as a management fee
equal to of the gross proceeds from the exercise of the Existing PIOs. The Company also agreed to reimburse Wainwright for its expenses
in connection with the exercise of the Existing PIOs and the issuance of the Inducement PIOS, up to for fees and expenses of legal
counsel and other out-of-pocket expenses and paid Wainwright for non-accountable expenses in the amount of . The Company also issued
to Wainwright or its designees warrants (the Placement Agent Warrants ), and as such shares of common stock issuable thereunder,
(the Placement Agent Warrant Shares to purchase (i) shares of common stock which have the same terms as the Inducement
PIOs except for an exercise price equal to per share and a term of (5) following the date of stockholder approval and
(ii) upon any exercise for cash of the Inducement PIOs, of the aggregate exercise price and that number of shares of common stock
equal to of the aggregate number of such shares of common stock underlying the Inducement PIOs that have not been exercised, which
will have substantially the same terms as the Placement Agent Warrants. 

The Company evaluated the terms of the Inducement PIOs and the Wainwright
Inducement Warrants (collectively, the August 2023 Inducement Warrants ), and determined that they should be classified as
equity instruments based upon accounting guidance provided in ASC 480 and ASC 815-40. 

The Warrant Inducement, which resulted in the lowering of the exercise
price of the Existing PIOs and the issuance of the Inducement PIOs, is considered a modification of the Existing PIOs under the guidance
of Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2021-04, Issuer s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of
Equity Classified Written Call Options . The modification is consistent with the Equity Issuance classification under
that guidance as the reason for the modification was to induce the holders of the Existing PIOs to cash exercise their warrants, resulting
in the imminent exercise of the Existing PIOs, which raised equity capital and generated net proceeds for the Company of approximately
 million. As the Existing PIOs and the Inducement PIOs were classified as equity instruments before and after the exchange, and as
the exchange is directly attributable to an equity offering, the Company recognized the effect of the modification of approximately 
million as an equity issuance cost.

The fair value of the contingent warrant liability of approximately was derecognized as of the settlement date, with the corresponding
amount, representing the fair value of the Wainwright Inducement Warrants, was recognized as additional paid-in capital. 

The Company evaluated the terms of the Inducement Contingent
Warrants (equivalent to of the aggregate number of such shares of common stock underlying the Inducement PIOs that have not been
exercised), which are issuable upon a future inducement, and determined that they should be classified as a liability based upon accounting
guidance provided in ASC 815-40. Since the Inducement Contingent Warrants are a form of compensation to Wainwright, the Company recorded
the value of the liability of approximately as a reduction of additional paid in capital, with subsequent changes in the value
of the liability recorded in other income (expense) in the accompanying condensed statements of operations.

2022 (the Existing PIOs ). Pursuant to the Inducement Letter, the Holder agreed to exercise for cash its Existing PIOs to
purchase an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock (the Inducement PIO Shares ), at a reduced exercise
price of per share, in exchange for the Company s agreement to issue new PIOs (the Inducement PIOs to purchase

by the Inducement Letter (the Warrant Inducement ). The Company received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million
from the Warrant Inducement, after deducing placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. 

Upon close of the transaction, the Company issued the Holder 
of the shares of common stock that were issuable upon exercise of the Existing PIOs. Due to the beneficial ownership limitation
provisions in the Inducement Letter, the remaining shares were initially unissued, and held in abeyance for the benefit of the
Holder until notice from the Holder that the shares may be issued in compliance with such limitation is received. These shares were issued
to the Holder in October 2023. 

The Company agreed to file a registration statement covering the resale
of the Inducement PIO Shares issued or issuable upon the exercise of the Inducement PIOs, as soon as practicable, and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to have such Resale Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC within 90 days following the date of the Inducement
Letter, and to keep the Resale Registration Statement effective at all times until there are no Inducement PIO Shares. The provision to
register the underlying shares in the Warrant Inducement does not require payment related to the registration rights provided. As such,
while the shares were not registered within 90 days of the date of the Inducement Letter, there is no accounting impact for this provision. 

The Company engaged Wainwright to act as its placement agent in connection
with the Warrant Inducement and paid Wainwright a cash fee equal to of the gross proceeds received from the exercise of the Existing
PIOs as well as a management fee equal to of the gross proceeds from the exercise of the Existing PIOs. The Company also agreed to

Warrants issuable under this provision is . 

The Company evaluated the terms of the Inducement PIOs and the Wainwright
Inducement Warrants (collectively, the August 2023 Inducement Warrants ), and determined that they should be classified as
equity instruments based upon accounting guidance provided in ASC 480 and ASC 815-40. The Company also evaluated the unissued shares held
in abeyance, which represent a prepaid forward contract, and determined that it is an equity instrument based on the guidance provided
in ASC 480 and ASC 815-40.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to those
statements included elsewhere in this Report and with the audited financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC, on April 11, 2024. In addition to historical financial
information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.
Some of the numbers included herein have been rounded for the convenience of presentation. Our actual results may differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements. 

Overview 

We are a commercial stage biotechnology company
focused on the research, development, and commercialization of innovative solutions for men s health and oncology. Through our recent
acquisition of Proteomedix, which closed on December 15, 2023, we own Proclarix, an in vitro diagnostic test for prostate cancer originally
developed by Proteomedix and approved for sale in the European Union under the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation IVDR ), which
we anticipate will be marketed in the U.S. as a lab developed test through our license agreement with LabCorp. 

We also own ENTADFI, an FDA-approved, once daily
pill that combines finasteride and tadalafil for the treatment of BPH, a disorder of the prostate. However, in light of (i) the time and
resources needed to continue pursuing commercialization of ENTADFI, and (ii) the Company s cash runway and indebtedness, the Company
determined to pause its commercialization of ENTADFI during the first quarter of 2024, as it explores strategic alternatives to monetize
ENTADFI, such as a potential sale of the ENTADFI assets. To that end, the Company has been working with an investment advisor to assist
with a potential sale or other transaction of the ENTADFI assets during the second and third quarters of 2024. There is currently no plan
to resume commercialization of ENTADFI, and as such, if we are not able to consummate a sale or other transaction of the ENTADFI assets,
we may abandon the assets and destroy our inventory of the product. In addition, as part of cost reduction efforts and in connection with
our initial pause in commercializing ENTADFI, we terminated three employees involved with the ENTADFI program, effective April 30,
2024, with such individuals to continue assisting the Company on an as-needed, consulting basis. Based on the current circumstances surrounding
ENTADFI, at June 30, 2024, the ENTADFI assets were fully impaired. Refer to Notes 4 and 5 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Report for further discussion. The Company continues to search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer. 

We are currently focusing our efforts on commercializing
Proclarix. 

Proclarix is an easy-to-use next generation protein-based
blood test that can be done with the same sample as a patient s regular Prostate-Specific Antigen PSA test. The
PSA test is a well-established prostate specific marker that measures the concentration of PSA molecules in a blood sample. A high level
of PSA can be a sign of prostate cancer. However, PSA levels can also be elevated for many other reasons including infections, prostate
stimulation, vigorous exercise, or even certain medications. PSA results can be confusing for many patients and even physicians. It is
estimated over 50 of biopsies with elevated PSA are negative or clinically insignificant resulting in an overdiagnosis and overtreatment
that impacts the physician s routine, our healthcare system, and the quality of patients lives. Approximately 10 of all
men have elevated PSA levels, commonly referred to as the diagnostic grey zone , of which only 20 40 present clinically
with cancer. Proclarix is intended for use in diagnosing these patients where it is difficult to decide if a biopsy is necessary to verify
a potential clinically significant cancer diagnosis. Proclarix helps doctors and patients with unclear PSA test results through the use
of our proprietary Proclarix Risk Score which delivers clear and immediate diagnostic support for further treatment decisions. No additional
intervention is required, and results are available quickly. Local diagnostic laboratories can integrate this multiparametric test into
their current workflow because Proclarix assays use the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) standard, which most diagnostic laboratories
are already equipped to process. 

Since our inception in October 2018 until April
2023, when we acquired ENTADFI, we devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development, undertaking preclinical
studies and enabling manufacturing activities in support of our product development efforts, hiring personnel, acquiring and developing
our technology and now halted vaccine candidates, organizing and staffing our company, performing business planning, establishing our
intellectual property portfolio and raising capital to support and expand such activities. 

During the third quarter of 2023, we halted our vaccine discovery and
development programs, and accordingly, we now operate in one segment: commercial. The commercial segment was new in the second quarter
of 2023 and is currently dedicated to the development and commercialization of Proclarix. 

40 

Given Proclarix is CE-marked for sale in the European
Union, we expect to generate revenue from sales of Proclarix by 2026. Although we anticipate these sales to offset some expenses relating
to commercial scale up and development, we expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities,
as we: 

commercialize
Proclarix; 

hire
additional personnel; 

operate
as a public company; and 

obtain,
maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio. 

We rely and will continue to rely on third parties
for the manufacturing of Proclarix. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities, and we will continue to rely on third parties, of
which the main suppliers are single-source suppliers, for commercial products. 

We do not have any products approved for sale,
aside from Proclarix in the European Union, and ENTADFI, from which we have not generated any revenue from product sales, and for which
we have now abandoned commercialization activities for. We are exploring strategic alternatives to monetize ENTADFI, such as a potential
sale of the ENTADFI assets. However, if we are not able to consummate a sale or other transaction of the ENTADFI assets, we may abandon
the assets and destroy our inventory of the product. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from our sale of
preferred securities to seed investors, the initial public offering, the private placements completed during 2022, the proceeds received
from a warrant exercise in August 2023, the proceeds received from the issuance of debt in January 2024, the proceeds received from a
warrant exercise in July 2024, and proceeds received from the private placement in October 2024 . We will continue to require significant
additional capital to commercialize Proclarix, and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, until such time as we can
generate significant revenue, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party
funding and to rely on third-party resources for marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances
and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches, to support our operations. 

Since June 30, 2024, some key developments affecting our business include
the following: 

Altos Units 

On January 23, 2024, the Company issued a
non-convertible debenture (the Altos Debenture in the principal sum of 5.0 million, in connection with a Subscription
Agreement, to Altos Ventures, a stockholder of the Company and related party Altos ). The Altos Debenture was originally
payable in full upon the earlier of (i) the closing under the Subscription Agreement and (ii) June 30, 2024. On April 24,
2024, the Altos Debenture was amended to extend the maturity date to the earlier of (i) the closing under the Subscription Agreement
and (ii) October 31, 2024 (the Altos Amendment ). On September 24, 2024, upon obtaining stockholder approval and pursuant
to the Subscription Agreement, dated December 28, 2023, the Company issued an aggregate of 513,424 units (the Units to
Altos, each Unit comprised of (i) one share of Common Stock and (ii) one pre-funded warrant (collectively, the Altos Warrants to purchase 0.3 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 0.04 per share. The Altos Warrants were immediately exercisable at any
time on or after the date of issuance and had a term of exercise of five (5) years from the date of issuance. The outstanding debt, as
per the Altos Debenture agreement, is considered settled through the unit issuance. 

Additional shares are issuable to Altos to the
extent Altos continues to hold Common Stock included in the Units and if the VWAP during the 270 days following closing is less than 10.00,
as set forth in the Subscription Agreement. 

On September 24, 2024, Altos exercised all the
Altos Warrants, and the Company issued to Altos an additional 154,027 shares of Common Stock upon such exercise.

Amended Forbearance Agreement 

On September 19, 2024, the Company entered into
an Amended and Restated Forbearance Agreement with Veru (the Amended and Restated Forbearance Agreement or A R

Agreement, Veru will forbear from exercising its rights under both April Veru Note and the September Veru note, subject to the terms and

Agreement also effected certain modifications to the payment terms in the Original Forbearance Agreement and amended certain terms of
the September Veru Note as summarized below. 

Pursuant to the A R Forbearance Agreement,
the Company agreed to make the following required payments (the Required Payments during the April 2024 Forbearance Period

of legal counsel and other out-of-pocket expenses and agreed to pay Wainwright for non-accountable expenses in the amount of 35,000.
The Company also agreed to issue to Wainwright or its designees warrants (the Placement Agent Warrants ), and as such shares
of common stock issuable thereunder, (the Placement Agent Warrant Shares to purchase (i) 13,054 shares of common stock
which will have the same terms as the Inducement PIOs except for an exercise price equal to 7.50 per share and a term of five (5) years
following the date of stockholder approval and (ii) upon any exercise for cash of the Inducement PIOs, 7.5 of the aggregate exercise
price and that number of shares of common stock equal to 7.0 of the aggregate number of such shares of common stock underlying the Inducement
PIOs that have not been exercised, which will have substantially the same terms as the Placement Agent Warrants. 

The Company evaluated the terms of the Inducement PIOs and the Wainwright
Inducement Warrants (collectively, the August 2023 Inducement Warrants ), and determined that they should be classified as
equity instruments based upon accounting guidance provided in ASC 480 and ASC 815-40. The Company also evaluated the unissued shares held
in abeyance, which represent a prepaid forward contract, and determined that it is an equity instrument based on the guidance provided
in ASC 480 and ASC 815-40. 

43 

The Warrant Inducement, which resulted in the lowering of the exercise
price of the Existing PIOs and the issuance of the Inducement PIOs, is considered a modification of the Existing PIOs under the guidance
of Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2021-04, Issuer s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of
Equity Classified Written Call Options . The modification is consistent with the Equity Issuance classification under
that guidance as the reason for the modification was to induce the holders of the Existing PIOs to cash exercise their warrants, resulting
in the imminent exercise of the Existing PIOs, which raised equity capital and generated net proceeds for the Company of approximately
 0.9 million. As the Existing PIOs and the Inducement PIOs were classified as equity instruments before and after the exchange, and as
the exchange is directly attributable to an equity offering, the Company recognized the effect of the modification of approximately 1.9
million as an equity issuance cost. 

In addition, the change in fair value of the contingent warrant liability
associated with 3,729 of the August 2022 Contingent Warrants and 7,459 of the August 2023 Contingent Warrants was decreased to 0 upon
the agreement with Wainwright that all prior contingent warrants were no longer issuable or due upon the Warrant Inducement Transaction.
The fair value of the contingent warrant liability of approximately 2,700 was derecognized as of the settlement date, with the corresponding
amount, representing the fair value of the Wainwright Inducement Warrants, was recognized as additional paid-in capital. 

The Company evaluated the terms of the 39,158 Inducement Contingent
Warrants (equivalent to 7.0 of the aggregate number of such shares of common stock underlying the Inducement PIOs that have not been
exercised), which are issuable upon a future inducement, and determined that they should be classified as a liability based upon accounting
guidance provided in ASC 815-40. Since the Inducement Contingent Warrants are a form of compensation to Wainwright, the Company recorded
the value of the liability of approximately 158,000 as a reduction of additional paid in capital, with subsequent changes in the value
of the liability recorded in other income (expense) in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. 

Reverse Stock Split 

On September 24, 2024, the Company effected a
Reverse Stock Split of all shares of its issued and outstanding Common Stock at a ratio of one-for-forty (1:40). The Company accounted
for the reverse stock split on a retrospective basis pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ASC 260, Earnings Per Share . All issued and outstanding common stock, common stock warrants, and share-based
awards exercise prices and per share data have been adjusted in these condensed consolidated financial statements, on a retrospective basis,
to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. The number of authorized shares and par value of the
preferred stock and common stock were not adjusted because of the reverse stock split. 

Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock 

On September 24, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate
of 142,749 shares of Common Stock to Veru Inc., following Veru s election to convert all the 3,000 shares of Series A preferred
stock Series A Preferred Stock of the Company issued to it on September 29, 2023. The Series A Preferred Stock was originally
issued to Veru pursuant to an Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated September 29, 2023, between the Company and Veru.

Stock was originally issued to the Sellers on December 15, 2023. The Series B Preferred Stock was originally issued to the Sellers pursuant
to a Share Exchange Agreement, dated December 15, 2023, between the Company, PMX, and the Sellers (the Share Exchange Agreement ),
and was subject to the automatic conversion following (i) the Company s receipt of stockholder approval for the issuance of the
PMX Converted Shares and ii) the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, which provided for a sufficient number of authorized shares
to issue the PMX Converted Shares, as contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement. 

Series C Preferred Stock 

On October 1, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized
the Company to create a series of 10,000 shares of preferred stock designated as Series C convertible Preferred Stock , with
a par value of 0.00001, pursuant to the certificate of designations. At any time after the initial issuance date of Series C convertible
Preferred Stock, each Preferred Share shall be convertible into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock.
The holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends, on an as-if converted basis, equal to and in the same form as dividends
actually paid on shares of Common Stock, when and if actually paid. Each holder is entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding
Preferred Shares held by such holder into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Conversion shares at the Conversion Rate, which
can be determined by dividing (x) the Conversion Amount of such Preferred Share by (y) the Conversion Price, 4.5056, subject to adjustment
as provided in the Certificate of Designations. 

44 

PIPE Financing and ELOC 

On October 1, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized
the Company to create a series of 10,000 shares of preferred stock designated as Series C convertible Preferred Stock , with
a par value of 0.00001, pursuant to the certificate of designations. At any time after the initial issuance date of Series C convertible
Preferred Stock, each Preferred Share shall be convertible into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock.
The holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends, on an as-if converted basis, equal to and in the same form as dividends
actually paid on shares of Common Stock, when and if actually paid. In addition, from and after the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Triggering Event, dividends Default Dividends will accrue on the Stated Value of each Preferred Share at a rate
of fifteen percent (15.0 (the Default Rate per annum. Each holder is entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding
Preferred Shares held by such holder into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Conversion shares at the Conversion Rate, which
can be determined by dividing (x) the Conversion Amount of such Preferred Share by (y) the Conversion Price, 4.5056, subject to adjustment
as provided in the Certificate of Designations. 

After the Stockholder Approval Date, if a Triggering
Event occurs and is continuing at any time after the earlier of the holders receipt of a Triggering Event Notice and such holder
becoming aware of such Triggering Event (such earlier date, the Alternate Conversion Right Commencement Date and ending
on the twentieth (20 th Trading Day after the later of (x) the date of such Triggering Event is cured and (y) such holder s
receipt of a Triggering Event Notice (such ending date, the Alternate Conversion Right Expiration Date ), and each such period,
an Alternate Conversion Right Period ), such holder may, at such holder s option, by delivery of a Conversion Notice
to the Company (the date of any such Conversion Notice, each an Alternate Conversion Date ), convert all, or any number of
Preferred Shares held by such holder into shares of Common Stock at the Alternate Conversion Price (each, an Alternate Conversion ).
Alternate Conversion Price means, with respect to any Alternate Conversion that price will be the lowest of (i) the applicable Conversion
Price as in effect on the applicable Conversion Date of the applicable Alternate Conversion, and (ii) the greater of (x) the Floor Price
and (y) 80 of the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock during the five (5) consecutive Trading Day period ending and including the Trading
Day immediately preceding the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable Conversion Notice (such period, the Alternate Conversion
Measuring Period ). 

At any time, the Company has the right to redeem
in cash all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Shares then outstanding at a price (the Company Optional Redemption Price equal to 125 of the greater of (i) the Conversion Amount being redeemed and (ii) the product of (1) the Conversion Rate with respect
to the Conversion Amount being redeemed multiplied by (2) the greatest closing sale price of the Company s Common Stock on any Trading
Day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding the date the Company notifies the holders of its elections to redeem
and the date the Company makes the entire payment required. Upon the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Triggering Event, the Company will immediately
redeem, in cash, each of the Preferred Shares then outstanding at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (A) the
Conversion Amount to be redeemed multiplied by (B) 125 and (ii) the product of (X) the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion
Amount in effect immediately following the date of initial public announcement of such Bankruptcy Triggering Event multiplied by (y) the
product of (1) 125 multiplied by (2) the greatest closing sale price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing
on the date immediately preceding such Bankruptcy Triggering Event and ending on the date the Company pays the entire payment required. 

In no event may any Preferred Shares be converted
(or Warrants be exercised) and shares of Common Stock be issued to any holder if after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common
Stock upon such conversion of the Preferred Shares (or exercise of the Warrants), the holder (together with its affiliates, if any) would
beneficially own more than 4.99 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, which we refer to herein as the PIPE Blocker .
The PIPE Blocker may be raised or lowered to any percentage not in excess of 9.99 at the option of the applicable holder of the Preferred
Shares (or Warrants), except that any raise will only be effective upon 61-days prior notice to the Company. 

On October 2, 2024, the Company entered into,
and sold, to six institutional investors (collectively, the PIPE Investors ), pursuant to the securities purchase agreement
an aggregate of 3,499 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock, par value 0.00001 per share, which includes an issuance of 840
shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the lead investor in consideration for the PIPE Investors irrevocable commitment to purchase
shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, and warrants to purchase 591,856 shares of Common Stock, (together, the PIPE Securities for aggregate net cash proceeds to the Company of 1.9 million. The exercise price of the warrants is 4.38, and the warrants are exercisable
six months after the issuance date and expire on the third anniversary of the initial exercisability date. 

45 

On October 2, 2024, the Company entered into a
Common Stock ELOC Purchase Agreement relating to a Committed Equity Facility with an institutional investor (the ELOC Purchaser ),
whereby the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, and whereby the ELOC Purchaser has committed to purchase,
up to 25.0 million of the Company s newly issued Common Stock, subject to certain limitations. Concurrently with entering into
the ELOC Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with the ELOC Purchaser, pursuant to which
it agreed to provide the ELOC Purchaser with certain registration rights related to the shares issued under the ELOC Purchase Agreement
(the ELOC Registration Rights Agreement ). In no event will the Company issue to the Purchaser under the ELOC Purchase Agreement
more than 1,658,525 shares of Common Stock, representing 19.99 of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the execution of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Exchange Cap ), unless (i) the Company obtains the approval
of the issuance of such shares by its stockholders in accordance with the applicable stock exchange rules or (ii) sales of Common Stock
are made at a price equal to or in excess of the lower of (A) the closing price immediately preceding the delivery of the applicable notice
to the Purchaser and (B) the average of the closing prices of the Common Stock for the five business days immediately preceding the delivery
of such notice, such that the sales of such Common Stock to the Purchaser would not count toward the Exchange Cap because they are at
market under applicable stock exchange rules. 

The Company may not issue or sell any shares of
Common Stock to the ELOC Purchaser under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, if it would result in the ELOC Purchaser beneficially owning
more than 4.99 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the ELOC Blocker ). The ELOC Blocker may be raised or lowered
to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99 at the option of the ELOC Purchaser, except that any raise will only be effective upon
61 days prior notice to the Company. 

Liquidity Outlook 

We have incurred net losses since inception and expect to continue
to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending
in large part on the timing of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing activities, our expenditures on other research
and development activities and commercialization activities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately
 16.3 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 86.0 million. In addition, as of December 5, 2024, the Company s cash
balance was approximately 0.4 million, all of which is currently held by the Company s foreign subsidiary. The Company believes
that its current cash balance is only sufficient to fund its operations through the end of December 2024, until it can utilize the Equity
Financing Line of Credit, which it entered into in on October 2, 2024, and as such, we will need to raise additional capital prior to
this to sustain operations. 

Until we generate revenue sufficient to support
self-sustaining cash flows, if ever, we will need to raise additional capital to fund our continued operations, including our product
development and commercialization activities related to our current and future products. There can be no assurance that additional capital
will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, or that we will ever generate revenue sufficient to provide self-sustaining cash
flows. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Report do not include any adjustment
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties
associated with our business, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve
or maintain profitability. Additionally, even if we are able to generate revenue from Proclarix or our other assets, we may not become
profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue
our operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce our operations. 

Certain Significant Relationships 

We have entered into license and other arrangements
with various third parties as summarized below. For further details regarding these and other agreements, see Notes 6 and 9 to each
of our audited financial statements included in the Form 10-K and unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

46 

Laboratory Corporation of America 

On March 23, 2023, Proteomedix entered into a license agreement with
LabCorp pursuant to which LabCorp has the exclusive right to develop and commercialize Proclarix, and other products developed by LabCorp
using Proteomedix s intellectual property covered by the license, in the United States Licensed Products ). In consideration
for granting LabCorp an exclusive license, Proteomedix received an initial license fee in the mid-six figures upon signing of the contract.
Additionally, Proteomedix is entitled to royalty payments between 5 and 10 on the net sales recognized by LabCorp of any Licensed Products
plus milestone payments as follows: 

after
the first sale of Proclarix as a laboratory developed test, LabCorp will pay an amount in the mid-six figures; 

after
LabCorp achieves a certain amount in the low seven figures in net sales of Licensed Products, LabCorp will pay Proteomedix an amount
in the low seven figures; and 

after
a certain amount in the mid-seven figures in net sales of Licensed Products, LabCorp will pay Proteomedix an amount in the low seven
figures. 

The total available milestone payments available
under the terms of this contract is 2.5 million. An additional 0.5 million was paid to Proteomedix as an initial license fee in 2023. 

LabCorp is wholly responsible for the cost, if
any, of research, development and commercialization of Licensed Products in the United States but has the right to offset a portion of
those costs against future royalty and milestone payments. Additionally, LabCorp may deduct royalties or other payments made to third
parties related to the manufacture or sale of Licensed Products up to a maximum amount of any royalty payments due to Proteomedix. 

The license agreement and related royalty payment
provisions expire during 2038, which approximates the expiration of the last patent covered by the license agreement. LabCorp has the
right to terminate the license agreement for any reason by providing 90 days written notice to Proteomedix. Either party may terminate
the license agreement due to a material breach of the terms of the license agreement with 30 days notice, provided such breach
is not cured within the foregoing 30-day period. Finally, Proteomedix may terminate the license agreement with 60 days notice in
the event LabCorp fails to make any undisputed payment due, provided that LabCorp does not remit the payment within the foregoing 60-day
period. 

Services Agreement 

On July 21, 2023, the Company, entered into a
Licensing and Services Master Agreement Master Services Agreement and a related statement of work with IQVIA, pursuant
to which IQVIA was to provide to the Company commercialization services for the Company s products, including recruiting, managing,
supervising and evaluating sales personnel and providing sales-related services for such products, for fees totaling up to 29.1 million
over the term of the statement of work. The statement of work had a term through September 6, 2026, unless earlier terminated in accordance
with the Master Services Agreement and the statement of work. On July 29, 2023, a second statement of work was entered into with the IQVIA
for certain subscription services providing prescription market data access to the Company. The fees under the second statement of work
totaled approximately 800,000, and the term was through July 14, 2025. On October 12, 2023, the Company terminated the Master Services
Agreement and the statements of work. The Company recorded net credits of approximately 0.4 million related to this contract during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company had approximately 1.1 million and 1.8 million recorded in
related accounts payable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which includes amounts due for early termination
of the contract. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

47 

Components of Results of Operations 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist
principally of commercialization activities, payroll, and personnel expenses, including salaries and bonuses, benefits and stock-based
compensation expenses, professional fees for legal, consulting, accounting and tax services, information technology costs, costs incurred
with respect to acquisitions and potential acquisitions, and other general operating expenses. 

We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative
expenses related to Proteomedix will increase when compared to historical levels as a result of efforts to commercialize Proclarix, and
costs associated with integration of Proteomedix s operations. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Historically, substantially all of our research
and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates. These expenses historically
have included fees paid to third parties to conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf, consulting costs, costs
for laboratory supplies, product acquisition and license costs, certain payroll, and personnel-related expenses, including salaries and
bonuses, employee benefit costs and stock-based compensation expenses for our research and product development employees. We expense both
internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. 

We do not allocate our costs by product candidate,
as a significant amount of research and development expenses include internal costs, such as payroll and other personnel expenses, laboratory
supplies, and external costs, such as fees paid to third parties to conduct research and development activities on our behalf, that are
not tracked by product candidate. 

As discussed above, we have terminated the vaccine
programs that substantially all of our research and development historically related to. We do not anticipate incurring significant research
and development expenses in the near future, unless we are able to resume such activities. Predicting the timing or cost to complete our
clinical programs for future product candidates, or validation of our commercial manufacturing and supply processes is difficult and delays
may occur because of many factors, including factors outside of our control, such as regulatory approvals. Furthermore, we are unable
to predict when or if our future product candidates will receive regulatory approval with any certainty. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other income (expense) is comprised of interest
expense on notes payable, the change in fair value of financial instruments that are recorded as liabilities, which includes the related
party subscription agreement liability and the contingent warrant liability, and other financing-related costs.

Revenue, Cost of Revenue, and Gross Margin 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company had approximately 0.4 million of revenue, which was attributable to development services generated by Proteomedix. Cost of
revenue of approximately 0.3 million was mostly attributable to costs incurred on Proteomedix revenue including amortization of the product
rights intangible asset of approximately 0.2 million. The Company did not have any revenue during the three months ended September 30,
2023. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

For the three months ended September 30,
2024, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.6 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was
due to the halt in commercialization of activities beginning in late 2023, specifically in sales and marketing efforts and business consulting,
which contributed 1.5 million towards the decrease and payroll expenses, which contributed an additional 0.5 million towards the decrease.
Furthermore, the impairment of intangible assets recorded in the prior year of approximately 0.3 million contributed to the decrease
as well. The decrease was offset by Proteomedix s selling, general and administrative expense increase of 0.7 million fully related
to the acquisition of the subsidiary in the last quarter of 2023. 

49 

Research and Development Expenses 

For the three months ended September 30,
2024, research and development expenses decreased by approximately 0.1 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease
was primarily attributable to the Company s decision to halt its vaccine programs and focus on commercialization activities, which
occurred during the third quarter of 2023. This change in business strategy led to a halt in the Company s clinical and other research
activities. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other expenses incurred during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, increased by approximately 0.4 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due
to approximately 0.2 million of increased related party interest expense, primarily related to the Altos Debenture issued in January
2024, and an increase of 0.9 million in the change in fair value of the subscription liability. These items were offset by the loss on
extinguishment of note payable recognized in the prior year of approximately 0.5 million, an approximate 0.1 million decrease in change
in fair value of contingent warrant liability as a result of the issuance of new contingent warrants upon the PIO inducement transaction,
and a decrease of approximately 0.1 million of interest expense due to the one of the ENTADFI notes outstanding in the third quarter
of 2023 being fully paid off prior to the current quarter. 

Income Tax Benefit 

The Company recorded an income tax benefit of
approximately 56,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, related to foreign deferred income taxes recorded in connection
with Proteomedix. There was no income tax benefit or expense recorded during the same period in 2023.

Revenue, Cost of Revenue, and Gross Margin 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company had approximately 1.8 million of revenue, which was attributable to product sales of approximately 0.1 million and development
services of approximately 1.7 million generated by Proteomedix. Cost of revenue of approximately 1.4 million was attributable to 0.5
million of costs incurred on the generation of Proteomedix revenue, as well as amortization of the product rights intangible asset of
approximately 0.5 million, and approximately 0.4 million related to the full impairment of ENTADFI inventory. The Company did not have
any revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 0.3 million compared to the same period in 2023. Proteomedix s
selling, general, and administrative expenses totaled approximately 2.2 million, of which approximately 1.6 million was related to audit
and legal fees, and salaries and benefits. Onconetix expenses offset this increase by 1.9 million, which was due to a reduction in commercialization
activities of approximately 0.7 million, including a reduction in fees due to IQVIA of approximately 0.5 million, decrease in stock-based
compensation expense of approximately 0.3 million, a decrease in impairment of long-lived assets of approximately 0.3 million, and a
 0.2 million decrease in the loss on related party receivable. 

Research and Development Expenses 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
research and development expenses decreased by approximately 2.0 million compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily
attributable to the Company s decision to halt its vaccine programs and focus on commercialization activities, which occurred during
the third quarter of 2023. This change in business strategy led to a halt in the Company s clinical and other research activities.
The decrease was only slightly offset by minimal research and development activities still ongoing at Proteomedix. 

Impairments 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company recorded impairment losses of approximately 15.5 million related to goodwill recorded in connection with the PMX acquisition,
and an impairment loss of approximately 3.5 million on the assets acquired as part of the ENTADFI asset acquisition. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
a 3.5 million impairment loss was recorded on the deposit for the WraSer APA. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other expenses incurred during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, increased by approximately 1.0 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due
to (i) approximately 0.5 million of interest expense related to the Altos Debenture issued in January 2024, (ii) an increase of 0.1
million of interest related to the April Veru Note, which was amended in April 2024, and (iii) a 1.0 million increase in the fair value
of the subscription liability. These increases were offset by a decrease in the fair value of the contingent warrant liability expense
of approximately 0.1 million and the extinguishment of the note payable in the previous period of approximately 0.5 million. 

Income Tax Benefit 

The Company recorded an income tax benefit of
approximately 127,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to foreign deferred income taxes recorded in connection
with Proteomedix. There was no income tax benefit or expense recorded during the same period in 2023. 

51 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company s operating activities to date
have been devoted to seeking licenses, engaging in research and development activities, potential asset and business acquisitions, and
expenditures associated with the previously planned commercial launch of ENTADFI and the commercialization of Proclarix. 

The Company has incurred substantial operating losses since inception
and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash
of approximately 0.3 million, a working capital deficit of approximately 16.3 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 86.0
million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used approximately 9.6 million in cash for operating activities.
In addition, as of December 5, 2024, the Company s cash balance was approximately 0.4 million, all of which is currently held
by the Company s foreign subsidiary. The Company s current cash balance is not sufficient to fund its operations through the
end of December 2024 until it can utilize the Equity Financing Line of Credit ELOC ), which it entered into on October
2, 2024, referred herein as the ELOC Purchase Agreement, and this raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The
Company s projections are also indicative that it is currently unable to meet its contractual commitments and obligations as they
come due in the ordinary course of business. The Company will require significant additional capital in the short-term to fund its continuing
operations, satisfy existing and future obligations and liabilities, including the remaining payments due for the acquisition of the ENTADFI
assets, and funds needed to support the Company s working capital needs and business activities. These business activities include
the development and commercialization of Proclarix, and the development and commercialization of the Company s future product candidates. 

Management s plans for funding the Company s
operations include generating product revenue from sales of Proclarix, which is still subject to further successful commercialization
activities within certain jurisdictions. Management also intends to secure additional required funding through equity or debt financings
if available, and to utilize the ELOC entered into in October 2024 (see Note 15) on an as-needed basis to assist with the paydown of the
debentures and to fund current operating needs, subject to certain restrictions and beneficial ownership constraints. However, based on
the terms of the ELOC and the current maximum availability, Management determined that the funds readily available under the ELOC will
not be sufficient to sustain operations. In addition, there are currently no other commitments in place for further financing nor is there
any assurance that such financing will be available to the Company on favorable terms, if at all. This creates significant uncertainty
whether the Company will have the funds available to be able to sustain its operations and expand commercialization of Proclarix. If the
Company is unable to secure additional capital, it may be required to curtail any future clinical trials, development and/or commercialization
of future product candidates, and it may take additional measures to reduce expenses in order to conserve its cash in amounts sufficient
to sustain operations and meet its obligations, or, if it is required to, file for bankruptcy. 

Because of historical and expected operating losses,
net operating cash flow deficits, and debts due within one year, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements, which is not alleviated by management s
plans. The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. These
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

52 

Future Funding Requirements 

We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant
expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to commercialize Proclarix and expand our corporate infrastructure. 

We will require significant amounts of additional
capital in the short-term, to continue to fund our continuing operations, satisfy existing and future obligations and liabilities, including
the remaining payments due under the Veru APA and other contracts entered into in support of the Company s commercialization plans,
in addition to funds needed to support our working capital needs and business activities, including the development and commercialization
of Proclarix, and the development and commercialization of our future product candidates. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of
revenue from sales of Proclarix, if at all, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings,
third-party funding and marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements,
or any combination of these approaches. The future sale of equity or convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders,
and, in the case of preferred equity securities or convertible debt, those securities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges
senior to those of our common stock. Debt financing may subject us to covenant limitations or restrictions on our ability to take specific
actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. There can be no assurance that we will
be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable or acceptable to us. If
we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed or on terms favorable or acceptable to us, we may be forced to delay, reduce the
scope of our business activities. 

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

the costs of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales, royalties, and distribution, for Proclarix, and other products for which we may receive marketing approval; 

the timing, scope, progress, results and costs of research and development, testing, screening, manufacturing, preclinical, non-clinical studies, and clinical trials; 

the outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform field efficacy studies, require more studies than those that we currently expect or change their requirements regarding the data required to support a marketing application; 

our ability to maintain existing, and establish new, strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of any such agreements, including the timing and amount of any future milestone, royalty, or other payments due under any such agreement; 

any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products; 

the expenses needed to attract, hire, and retain skilled personnel; 

the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of Proclarix, or other products for which we may have received or will receive marketing approval; 

the costs to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patents or other intellectual property rights; and 

the costs of operating as a public company. 

A change in the outcome of any of these or other
variables could significantly change the costs and timing associated with our business activities. Furthermore, our operating plans may
change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such change.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 9.6 million, which primarily resulted from a net loss of approximately
 29.3 million, net change in our operating assets and liabilities of approximately 2.3 million and net change of deferred tax benefit
by approximately 0.1 million. These items were offset by several non-cash items, which include: impairments of goodwill and ENTADFI of
approximately 15.5 million and 3.5 million, respectively, depreciation and amortization expense of approximately 0.6 million, loss
on impairment of ENTADFI inventory of approximately 0.4 million, noncash interest expense and amortization of debt discounts of approximately
 1.1 million, and increase in the fair value of subscription liability of 1.0 million. 

Net cash used in operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 9.3 million, which primarily resulted from a net loss of 15.1 million. This was
offset by a change in our operating assets and liabilities of 0.1 million, an impairment loss of 3.5 million related to the deposit
of the WraSer APA, an approximate 0.5 million loss on the extinguishment of a note payable, noncash stock-based compensation of approximately
 0.6 million, noncash interest expense of approximately 0.5 million, a 0.3 million loss on impairment of long-lived assets, and the
loss on related party receivable of approximately 0.3 million. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 25,000 resulted from purchases of property and equipment. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 9.9 million, of which approximately 6.1 million was used for the acquisition
of ENTADFI, 3.5 million was used for the deposit in connection with the WraSer APA, and approximately 0.3 million is the net change
in the receivable from related parties. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 5.4 million, and resulted primarily from the issuance of an aggregate of approximately
 5.9 million in notes payable, consisting of a 5.0 million debenture and approximately 0.9 million for the financing of director and
officer liability insurance policy premiums and the proceeds received from the exercise of preferred investment options in connection
with the warrant inducement transaction of approximately 0.9 million. These proceeds were offset by approximately 0.9 million in payments
on the notes payable and 0.4 million in the payment of financing costs. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 1.0 million, and resulted from net proceeds from the exercise of preferred
investment options in connection with the warrant inducement transaction of 2.3 million, offset by 1.0 million in principal payments
on a note payable, approximately 0.1 million in purchases of treasury shares and approximately 0.2 million of payment in deferred offering
costs. 

Legal Contingencies 

From time to time, we may become involved in legal
proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business. We record a liability for such matters when it is probable that future losses
will be incurred and that such losses can be reasonably estimated. 

54 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

During the periods presented we did not have,
nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these
condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing
basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. 

As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material
changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 11, 2024. 

As of the close of the NASDAQ stock market on December 5, 2024, our
stock price was 0.63 per share. This is a significant decline from September 30, 2024 where our closing price was 5.20 per share. If
the stock remains at this level by the close of business on December 31, 2024, we believe this is an indicator for impairment which would
require us to perform an impairment test since the fair value of our one reporting unit would be substantially less than its carrying
value. Any impairment charge could result in a substantial non-cash expense, affecting our financial performance. 

JOBS Act 

Section 107 of the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until those standards would
otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period. 

For as long as we remain an emerging growth company under
the JOBS Act, we will, among other things: 

be
exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires that our independent registered public
accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; 

be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and 

be
exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or
a supplement to the auditor s report on the financial statements. 

We currently intend to take advantage of some
or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us so long as we qualify as an emerging growth
company, including the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of
the JOBS Act. Among other things, this means that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an
attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company,
which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise,
so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial
information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide
in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. As a
result, investor confidence in our company and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the
information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things,
that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the appropriate time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, as a result of the material weaknesses described below. 

Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

During 2023, after a review completed by the Audit
Committee, it was determined that our former CEO and an accounting employee charged certain personal expenses on their corporate credit
cards that were not recorded as related party receivables. These unauthorized charges, in addition to personal charges that were identified
as such in previous reporting periods, may have constituted personal loans that are not permissible under Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. We determined that this credit card misuse arose from the following control deficiencies, which we have determined to be
material weaknesses as of September 30, 2024: 

We
did not maintain an effective control environment as there was an inadequate segregation of duties with respect to certain cash disbursements.
The processing and the approval for payment of credit card transactions and certain bank wires were being handled by the CEO and an accounting
employee, and the accounting employee was responsible for the reconciliation of credit card statements and bank statements. This allowed
these individuals to submit unauthorized payments to unauthorized third parties. 

We
do not have an effective risk assessment process and effective monitoring of compliance with established accounting policies and procedures,
and do not demonstrate a sufficient level of precision in the application of our controls, including the maintenance of board committee
minutes and unanimous written consents. 

Our
controls over the approval and reporting of expenses paid with the Company s credit cards and certain bank wires were not designed
and maintained to achieve the Company s objectives. 

We
have insufficient accounting resources to maintain adequate segregation of duties, maintain adequate controls over the approval and posting
of journal entries, and to provide optimal levels of oversight in order to process financial information in a timely manner, analyze
and account for complex, non-routine transactions, and prepare financial statements. 

We
do not yet have adequate internal controls in place for the timely identification, approval or reporting of related party transactions. 

The
Company did not design, implement, and maintain effective controls to ensure information technology IT policies and procedures
set the tone at the top, to mitigate the risks to the achievement of IT objectives and ITGCs in the change management, logical security,
and computer operations domains. Specifically, the design and implementation of user authentication, user access privileges, data backup
and data recovery controls as well as the monitoring controls of excessive user access and elevated privileged access to financial applications
and data were not appropriately designed and maintained. In addition, these inadequate ITGC controls combined with the use of personal
devices to conduct business, can lead to an IT control environment vulnerable to breaches and social engineering persuasion. 

The above material weaknesses did not result in
a material misstatement of our previously issued financial statements but could have resulted in material misstatements of our account
balances or disclosures of our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. We have developed a remediation
plan for these material weaknesses which is described below in Remediation of Material Weaknesses . 

56 

Remediation of Material Weaknesses 

We are committed to maintaining a strong internal
control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that the material weaknesses are remediated as soon as possible.
We believe we have made progress towards remediation. Management has designed and begun to implement the following remediation plan: 

Terminated
the accounting employee involved in the misuse and reassigned such employee s roles and responsibilities regarding impacted control
activities. 

Implemented
a travel, entertainment, and gift policy, which our Board approved on August 31, 2023. 

Implement
a formal information security policy. 

Review
and update, as necessary, the design and operation of our process level and transaction level controls for cash disbursements, credit
card transactions, and journal entries. Implement enhanced approval policies. 

We will consider the material weaknesses remediated
after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls
are operating effectively. 

The process of designing and implementing an effective
accounting and financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and
the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain an accounting and financial reporting system
that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations. As we continue to evaluate and take actions to improve our internal control over
financial reporting, we may determine to take additional actions to address control deficiencies or determine to modify certain of the
remediation measures described above. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the
future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness we have identified or avoid potential future material weaknesses. 

Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of
Internal Control Processes 

Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will
prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by
management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures
may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur
and not be detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During the fiscal quarter ended September 30,
2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 

57 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We are not currently subject to any material legal
proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us or any of our officers or directors in their
corporate capacity. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

In addition to the following risk factors, you
should carefully consider the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 11, 2024, as supplemented
and updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K that we have filed or will file with the SEC.
Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional
risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. 

Risks Related to our Financial Position and
Need for Capital 

We have incurred significant net losses
since inception, have only generated minimal revenue, and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the foreseeable
future and may never achieve profitability. Our stock is a highly speculative investment. 

We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company
that was incorporated in October 2018. Our net loss was 3.8 million and 29.3 million for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 86.0 million. We also generated negative operating
cash flows of 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

We expect to continue to spend significant resources
to commercialize our product. We expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses over the next several years. As a result,
our accumulated deficit will also increase significantly. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our current products or those that
may be under development by us in the future will be commercially viable. If we are unable to achieve profitability or raise sufficient
working capital, we may be unable to continue our operations. 

There is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern, and we will require substantial additional funding to finance our long-term operations.
If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our products
and operations. 

The
Company has incurred substantial operating losses since inception and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the
foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of approximately 0.3 million, a working capital deficit of approximately
 16.3 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 86.0 million. In addition, as of December 5, 2024, the Company s
cash balance was approximately 0.4 million, and the Company has approximately 9.8 million of debt due within the next 12 months. 

We estimate, as of the date of this Report, that
our current cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations through the end of December until it can utilize the ELOC. We believe
that we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our continuing operations, satisfy existing and future obligations and
liabilities, and otherwise support the Company s working capital needs and business activities, including making the remaining payments
to Veru and the commercialization of Proclarix. Management s plans for funding the Company s operations include generating
product revenue from sales of Proclarix, which is still subject to further successful development and commercialization activities within
certain jurisdictions. Management also intends to secure additional required funding through equity or debt financings if available, and
to utilize the ELOC entered into in October 2024 (see Note 15) on an as-needed basis to assist with the paydown of the debentures and
to fund current operating needs, subject to certain restrictions and beneficial ownership constraints. However, based on the terms of
the ELOC and the current maximum availability, Management determined that the funds readily available under the ELOC will not be sufficient
to sustain operations. In addition, there are currently no other commitments in place for further financing nor is there any assurance
that such financing will be available to the Company on favorable terms, if at all. This creates significant uncertainty whether the Company
will have the funds available to be able to sustain its operations and expand commercialization of Proclarix. If the Company is unable
to secure additional capital, it may be required to curtail any future clinical trials, development and/or commercialization of future
product candidates, and it may take additional measures to reduce expenses in order to conserve its cash in amounts sufficient to sustain
operations and meet its obligations, or, if it is required to, file for bankruptcy. 

58 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year from the issuance of the condensed consolidated
financial statements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

the
costs of future development and commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales, royalties, and distribution,
for Proclarix and other products for which we have received or will receive marketing approval; 

our
ability to maintain existing, and establish new, strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of
any such agreements, including the timing and amount of any future milestone, royalty, or other payments due under any such agreement; 

any
product liability or other lawsuits related to our products; 

the
expenses needed to attract, hire, and retain skilled personnel; 

the
revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of Proclarix or other products for which we may receive marketing approval; 

the
costs to establish, maintain, expand, enforce, and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and
timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting,
defending, and enforcing our patents or other intellectual property rights; and 

the
costs of operating as a public company. 

Our ability to raise additional funds will depend
on financial, economic, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be
available on acceptable terms, or at all. We have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital
in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to delay, reduce, or terminate our business activities. 

We owe a significant amount of money to
Veru, which funds we do not have. Veru may take action against us to enforce its rights to payment in the future, which could have a material
adverse effect on us and our operations. 

Due to recent financial constraints, the Company
may be unable to timely pay amounts due to Veru, from whom we purchased ENTADFI in April 2023. We may not have sufficient funds to pay
amounts due to Veru in the near term, if at all, including but not limited to 10 million, 5 million of which was due on April 19, 2024
and is subject to certain forbearance terms, and 5 million of which was due on September 30, 2024 and is subject to certain forbearance
terms. On April 24, 2024, Veru agreed to forbear its rights and remedies until March 31, 2025 with respect to, among other things, our
inability to pay amounts due on April 19, 2024, and on September 19, 2024, Veru agreed to forbear its rights and remedies until June 30,
2025 with respect to, among other things, our inability to pay amounts due on September 30, 2024. However, Veru may take future action
against us, including filing legal proceedings against us seeking amounts due and interest accrued or attempting to terminate its relationship
with us. If Veru were to take legal action against us, we may be forced to scale back our business plan and/or seek bankruptcy protection.
We may be subject to litigation and damages for our failure to pay amounts due to Veru, and may be forced to pay interest and penalties,
which funds we do not currently have. We are currently considering strategic options for ENTADFI, including a potential sale or abandonment,
and plan to seek funding to support our operations, and to pay amounts due to Veru, through a combination of equity offerings, debt financing
or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses, sales, and other similar arrangements, which may not be available
on favorable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our stockholders.
Furthermore, any revenue or financing proceeds that we are required to pay to Veru will detract from our ability to use such funds to
support our operations. 

59 

Our current liabilities are significant,
and if those to whom we owe accounts payable, such as Veru, IQVIA or other creditors or vendors, were to demand payment, we would be unable
to pay. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had total current
liabilities of approximately 17.4 million, including accounts payable of approximately 4.1 million, accrued expenses of approximately
 1.3 million, the related party subscription liability of 1.8 million, and approximately 9.8 million (net of discounts) related to notes
payable, primarily due to Veru. As of the same date, we had cash of only 0.3 million. We are currently considering strategic options
for ENTADFI, including a potential sale or abandonment, and plan to seek funding to support our operations. However, the level of our
current liabilities may make it more difficult for us to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms, if at all. If those to whom these
payments are due were to demand immediate payment, as they are entitled to do, and we are not able to make the required payments, we would
be subject to liability if our creditors chose to enforce their rights, which could result in our bankruptcy and insolvency. Under such
a scenario, our assets would be distributed to our creditors, leaving nothing to be distributed to our stockholders. 

Risks Related to the Commercialization of our
Products 

Company shareholders may not realize a benefit
from the ENTADFI or Proteomedix acquisitions commensurate with the ownership dilution they have experienced in connection with the transactions. 

If the Company is unable to realize the full strategic
and financial benefits previously anticipated from the recent ENTADFI and Proteomedix acquisitions, our shareholders may experience a
dilution of their ownership interests in our Company without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate
benefit to the extent the Company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits previously anticipated from the
transactions. We are currently considering strategic options for ENTADFI, including a potential sale. There is currently no plan to commercialize
ENTADFI, and as such, if we are not able to consummate a sale or other transaction of the ENTADFI assets, we may abandon the assets and
destroy our inventory of the product. 

We may fail or elect not to commercialize
our products. 

We
may not successfully commercialize our products. We or our collaboration partners in any potential commercial marketing efforts of our
product may not be successful in achieving widespread patient or physician awareness or acceptance of this product. Also, we may be subject
to pricing pressures from competitive products or from governmental or commercial payors or regulatory bodies that could make it difficult
or impossible for us to commercialize our products. Any failure to commercialize our products c ould
have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and our business. 

We are currently considering strategic options
for ENTADFI, including a potential sale. There is currently no plan to commercialize ENTADFI, and as such, if we are not able to consummate
a sale or other transaction of the ENTADFI assets, we may abandon the assets and destroy our inventory of the product. The Company continues
to consider various measures, including strategic alternatives, to rationalize its operations and optimize its existing Proclarix diagnostic
program. 

If we fail to further commercialize Proclarix,
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected and our reputation in the
industry and in the investment community would likely be damaged. 

We are dependent on third parties, including
LabCorp, to develop, market, distribute and sell our products. 

Our ability to receive revenues is dependent upon
the sales and marketing efforts of co-marketing partners and third-party distributors. In particular, the development and commercialization
of Proclarix in the United States is being pursued by LabCorp, pursuant to an exclusive license agreement that grants LabCorp the exclusive
right to develop and commercialize Proclarix, and other products developed by LabCorp using Proteomedix s intellectual property
covered by the license, in the United States for identification, screening, staging, predisposition, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring,
prevention or treatment selection with respect to prostate cancer. However, we do not have control over LabCorp s development and
commercialization of Proclarix, and there can be no guarantee that LabCorp will continue to advance development and commercialization
efforts, or that LabCorp will successfully commercialize Proclarix in the United States. 

LabCorp may terminate or seek to renegotiate the
terms of this agreement, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. If LabCorp terminates the agreement
or demands terms that are less favorable to us, we may experience disruptions in our product development and commercialization efforts,
potentially leading to a loss of revenue and market share. 

Additionally, if LabCorp is unable to commercialize
Proclarix in the United States, and we fail to reach an agreement with any other commercialization partner, or upon reaching such an agreement
that partner fails to sell a large volume of our products, it may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.
