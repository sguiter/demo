 million (for the cash on hand of the disposed business, the assets and liabilities of the Disposal Group and inventory). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, regulatory approvals were received, and the Disposal Group met the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 360, " Property, Plant and Equipment " ("ASC 360"). In accordance with ASC 805, " Business Combinations, " the Disposal Group constituted a business, and therefore, the Company allocated million of goodwill from of its reporting units to assets held for sale based on a relative fair value basis. These reporting units were evaluated for impairment subsequent to the allocation of goodwill to the Disposal Group and it was determined that the fair value of all reporting units was in excess of their carrying amounts. Additionally, in accordance with ASC 360, the Disposal Group was measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. As the carrying value of the Disposal Group exceeded the fair value less costs to sell, a loss of million was recognized for the year ended March 30, 2024, which was recorded in "Other operating expense" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The divestiture of the Disposal Group did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations per ASC 205-20, " Presentation of Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations. "

While legal title to the inventory resides with Luxshare, in accordance with ASC 606 " Revenue from Contracts with Customers ," the Company will continue to recognize the inventory on its balance sheet and has recorded a financial liability (which is included in "Other current liabilities") equal to the cash received by the Company attributable to the inventory subject to repurchase. 
 
 The cash received from the sale of the assets and liabilities of the Disposal Group of million is included in cash flows from investing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended September 28, 2024, net of a million deposit received in fiscal 2024 upon execution of the Purchase Agreement (which was included in Other investing activities in the fiscal 2024 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows).

 Other income, net 
 During the three months ended September 28, 2024, we recorded interest income of 13.8 million and net gains of 1.7 million from our share of the profit or loss from our limited partnership investments and gains or losses from other investments. During the six months ended September 28, 2024, we recorded interest income of 26.2 million and net gains of 0.6 million from our share of the profit or loss from our limited partnership investments and gains or losses from other investments.

During the six months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded interest income of 15.9 million and net gains of 2.1 million from our share of the profit or loss from our limited partnership investments and gains or losses from other investments. 
 
 Income tax expense 
 During the three and six months ended September 28, 2024, we recorded income tax expense of 19.9 million and 18.8 million, respectively, comprised primarily of tax expense related to international operations generating pre-tax book income and the impact of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI"), partially offset by tax benefits related to domestic and international operations generating pre-tax book losses, domestic tax credits and discrete tax items. The discrete tax benefit for the three months ended September 28, 2024 primarily related to the impacts of restructuring activities initiated in fiscal 2025 (refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). For the six months ended September 28, 2024, this tax benefit was offset by the discrete tax effects of the sale of the Company's assembly and test operations in China (refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). 
 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 42.1 million and 34.0 million, respectively, comprised primarily of tax expense related to international operations generating pre-tax book income, the impact of GILTI and discrete tax items, partially offset by tax benefits related to domestic and international operations generating pre-tax book losses and domestic tax credits recorded during the period. The discrete tax expense for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from foreign currency gains recognized for tax purposes. 
 
 A valuation allowance remained against certain domestic and foreign net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. As of September 28, 2024, we had working capital of approximately 1,198.7 million, including 1,096.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to working capital of approximately 1,215.9 million, including 1,029.3 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 30, 2024. 
 
 Our 1,096.5 million of total cash and cash equivalents as of September 28, 2024, includes approximately 888.0 million held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which 691.1 million is held by Qorvo International Pte. Ltd. in Singapore. If the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed in the U.S., we may be required to pay state income and/or foreign local withholding taxes to repatriate these earnings. 
 
 We may from time to time seek to retire or make additional optional payments on our outstanding debt obligations through repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding notes, which may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. Such tenders, exchanges, purchases, or other transactions, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we repurchased 27.3 million of the principal amount of our 2024 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the open market. The remaining principal amount of the 2024 Notes of 412.5 million is included in "Current portion of long-term debt" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2024. 
 
 In August 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act (the "CHIPS Act") was signed into law. The CHIPS Act provides for a 25 refundable tax credit on certain investments in domestic semiconductor

 manufacturing. The tax credit is provided for qualifying property which is placed in service after December 31, 2022, and for which construction begins before January 1, 2027. We recognized an anticipated tax credit during the three months ended September 28, 2024 within other non-current assets and will receive the cash benefit in future periods when applied against our tax obligations. 
 
 Stock Repurchases 
 During the six months ended September 28, 2024, we repurchased approximately 2.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately 207.5 million (including transaction costs and excise tax) under our share repurchase program. As of September 28, 2024, approximately 1,098.7 million remains authorized for repurchases under the program. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 208.9 million and 137.9 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectiv ely. This increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by changes in working capital, partially offset by decreased profitability. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 52.0 million and 24.2 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the six months ended September 28, 2024, the Company purchased 30.0 million of short-term investments and received proceeds of 55.6 million from the divestiture of our assembly and test operations in China. During the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received proceeds of 47.3 million, primarily from the sale of our manufacturing facility in Farmers Branch, Texas. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 109.3 million and 214.3 million for the six months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the six months ended September 28, 2024, we received net proceeds of 142.8 million from Luxshare Precision Industry Co., Ltd. for inventory (subject to repurchase) in connection with our supply agreement (refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and we repurchased 27.3 million of the principal amount of our 2024 Notes for 26.7 million. 

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 
 Credit Agreement On April 23, 2024, we entered into a five-year unsecured senior credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer and a syndicate of lenders (the Credit Agreement ), which replaced our previous credit agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a 325.0 million senior revolving line of credit (the Revolving Facility ). We may request at any time that the Revolving Facility be increased by up to 325.0 million , subject to securing additional funding commitments from existing or new lenders. The Revolving Facility is available to finance working capital, capital expenditures and other lawful corporate purposes. 
 
 During the six months ended September 28, 2024, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Facility. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds and to avoid an event of default. As of September 28, 2024 , we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 
 2024 Notes On December 14, 2021, we issued 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year at a rate of 1.750 per annum. The remaining principal amount of the 2024 Notes of 412.5 million is included in "Current portion of long-term debt" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2024 and will mature on December 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms. The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). 
 
 2029 Notes On September 30, 2019, we issued 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Notes. On December 20, 2019, and June 11, 2020, we issued an additional 200.0 million and 300.0 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Notes. Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year at a rate of 4.375 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 per annum. The 2029 Notes will mature on October 15, 2029, unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors. 
 
 2031 Notes On September 29, 2020, we issued 700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2031 Notes. Interest on the 2031 Notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year at a rate of 3.375 per annum. The 2031 Notes will mature on April 1, 2031, unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms. The 2031 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Guarantors. 
 
 For additional information regarding our debt, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Capital Commitments As of September 28, 2024, we had capital commitments of approximately 116.3 million primarily for expanding capability to develop and support new products, equipment and facility upgrades and cost savings initiatives. 
 
 Future Sources of Funding Our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors, including market acceptance of and demand for our products, acquisition opportunities, technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers. Based on current and projected levels of cash flows from operations, coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and availability from the Revolving Facility, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our short-term and long-term cash requirements. However, if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products, or if investments in our business outpace revenue growth, operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs. If existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable, we may seek additional debt or equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing could be dilutive to holders of our common stock. Further, we cannot be sure that additional debt or equity financing, if required, will be available on favorable terms, if at all. 
 
 Legal We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business that have not been fully adjudicated. We accrue a liability for legal contingencies when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of the previously accrued liability and record adjustments as appropriate. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of the unresolved legal matters, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We believe the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal matters is not material. 
 
 Taxes We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject to audits by tax authorities. While we endeavor to comply with all applicable tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law than we do or that we will comply in all respects with applicable tax laws, which could result in additional taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from tax audits will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period during which the review is conducted. 

SUPPLEMENTAL PARENT AND GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 In accordance with the indentures governing the 2024 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes (together, the "Notes"), our obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several unsecured basis by the Guarantors, which are listed on Exhibit 22 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Each Guarantor is 100 owned, directly or indirectly, by Qorvo, Inc. ("Parent"). A Guarantor can be released in certain customary circumstances. Our other U.S. subsidiaries and our non-U.S. subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes (such subsidiaries are referred to as the "Non-Guarantors"). 
 
 The following presents summarized financial information for the Parent and the Guarantors on a combined basis as of and for the periods indicated, after eliminating (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Parent and the Guarantors, and (ii) equity earnings from, and investments in, any Non-Guarantor. The summarized financial information may not necessarily be indicative of the financial position and results of operations had the combined Parent and Guarantors operated independently from the Non-Guarantors.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," contained in Qorvo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of such date, to enable the Company to record, process, summarize and report in a timely manner the information that the Company is required to disclose in its Exchange Act reports, and to accumulate and communicate such information to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report and in our other reports and statements that we file with the SEC, careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A., "Risk Factors" in Qorvo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in Qorvo's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

 On November 2, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock, which included the remaining authorized dollar amount under a prior program terminated concurrent with the new authorization. Under this program, share repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The extent to which we repurchase our shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases depends on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations. The program does not require us to repurchase a minimum number of shares, does not have a fixed term, and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice. 
 
 As of January 1, 2023, our share repurchases in excess of issuances are subject to a 1 excise tax enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act. The excise tax is recognized as part of the cost basis of shares acquired in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and is excluded from amounts presented above.
