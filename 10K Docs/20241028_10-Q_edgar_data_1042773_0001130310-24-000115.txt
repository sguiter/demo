 registrants: CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC. Information contained herein relating to any individual registrant is filed by such registrant solely on its own behalf. Each registrant makes no representation as to information relating exclusively to the other Registrants or the subsidiaries of CenterPoint Energy other than itself or its subsidiaries. 
 
 Except as discussed in Note 11, no registrant has an obligation in respect of any other Registrant s debt securities, and holders of such debt securities should not consider the financial resources or results of operations of any Registrant other than the obligor in making a decision with respect to such securities. 

As of September 30, 2024, CenterPoint Energy s operating subsidiaries were as follows: 
 
 Houston Electric owns and operates electric transmission and distribution facilities in the Texas gulf coast area that includes the city of Houston; 
 
 CERC Corp. (i) directly owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas, (ii) indirectly, through Indiana Gas and CEOH, owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in Indiana and Ohio, respectively, and (iii) owns and operates permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through CEIP; and 
 
 SIGECO provides energy delivery services to electric and natural gas customers located in and near Evansville in southwestern Indiana and owns and operates electric generation assets to serve its electric customers and optimizes those assets in the wholesale power market. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, CenterPoint Energy s reportable segments were Electric, Natural Gas, and Corporate and Other. Houston Electric and CERC each consist of a single reportable segment. For a description of CenterPoint Energy s reportable segments, see Note 15.

 billion and subject to adjustment as set forth in the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on net working capital, regulatory assets and liabilities and capital expenditures at closing. The completion of the proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (ii) approval of the LPSC, (iii) approval of the MPSC, (iv) no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement) having occurred, and (v) customary closing conditions regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance by the parties with the respective obligations under the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement. The proposed transaction is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025, subject to satisfaction of the foregoing conditions. The businesses include approximately miles of main pipeline in Louisiana and Mississippi serving more than customers. The Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses are reflected in CenterPoint Energy s Natural Gas reportable segment and CERC s single reportable segment, as applicable. Filings were made on April 24, 2024 to the LPSC and on April 25, 2024 to the MPSC requesting approval of the transaction. 
 
 In February 2024, certain assets and liabilities representing the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses met the held for sale criteria. The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes, requiring net deferred tax liabilities to be excluded from held for sale balances. 
 
 The Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell. Neither CenterPoint Energy nor CERC recognized any gains or losses upon classification of held for sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 9 for further information about the allocation of goodwill to the businesses to be sold.

 Although the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses meet the held for sale criteria, their proposed disposals do not represent a strategic shift for CenterPoint Energy and CERC as both will retain significant operations in, and will continue to invest in, their natural gas businesses. Therefore, the assets and liabilities associated with these transactions are not reflected as discontinued operations on CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income, as applicable, and the December 31, 2023 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were not required to be recast for assets held for sale. Since the depreciation on the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses assets will continue to be reflected in revenues through customer rates until the expected closing of the transaction and will be reflected in the carryover basis of the rate-regulated assets once sold, CenterPoint Energy and CERC will continue to record depreciation on those assets through the expected closing of the transaction. 

Divestiture of Energy Systems Group. On May 21, 2023, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary Vectren Energy Services, entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement to sell all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Energy Systems Group to ESG Holdings Group, for a purchase price of million, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on Energy Systems Group s net working capital at closing, indebtedness, cash and cash equivalents and transaction expenses. The transaction closed on June 30, 2023, and CenterPoint Energy received million in cash. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, CenterPoint Energy had a payable of approximately million to ESG Holdings Group for working capital and other adjustments set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement, which had not yet been finalized. For a discussion of CenterPoint Energy s pre-disposition guarantees related to Energy Systems Group, see Note 13(b). 
 
 CenterPoint Energy recognized a loss on sale of approximately million, including million of transaction costs, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in connection with the closing of the sale of Energy Systems Group. Additionally, CenterPoint Energy recognized a current tax expense of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the cash taxes payable upon the closing of the sale.

On August 1, 2024, Houston Electric announced that it was withdrawing its base rate application with the PUCT in order to focus on addressing the impacts of Hurricane Beryl in its service territory and accelerating preparedness and resiliency efforts for the remaining storm season. Subsequently, intervenors filed a motion to challenge the withdrawal of the base rate proceeding. On August 16, 2024, the ALJ issued an order denying the requested withdrawal of the base rate proceeding, leaving the base rate proceeding abated. Houston Electric filed an appeal of the ALJ s order to the PUCT, and on October 24, 2024, the PUCT heard oral arguments on the appeal and indicated that they will decide the appeal on November 14, 2024.

 Texas Public Securitization 
 
 The Texas Natural Gas Securitization Finance Corporation issued customer rate relief bonds in March 2023, and on March 23, 2023, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, collectively, received approximately billion in cash proceeds from the issuance and sale of the state s customer rate relief bonds. The proceeds from the state s customer rate relief bonds included carrying costs incurred through August 2022. Incremental carrying costs incurred after August 2022 until the date the proceeds were received are recorded in a separate regulatory asset; the most recent CERC rate proceeding in Texas included a request for recovery of this regulatory asset and was included in the settlement agreement approved by the Railroad Commission in June 2024. As CenterPoint Energy and CERC have no future financial obligations for the repayment of the state s customer rate relief bonds, the customer rate relief bonds are not recorded on CenterPoint Energy s or CERC s balance sheets. The billion in cash proceeds from the state s customer rate relief bonds is considered to be a government grant. The state s customer rate relief bonds are backed in part by customer rate relief property, including customer rate relief charges, which are non-bypassable uniform monthly volumetric charges to be paid by all existing and future sales customers as a component of each regulated utility s gas cost, separate from their base rate. CERC only acts as a collection agent, whose duties include management, servicing and administration of a portion of the customer rate relief property which is associated with the customer rate relief charge imposed on customers of CERC under the guidance and direction from the Railroad Commission. The Texas Natural Gas Securitization Finance Corporation, and not CenterPoint Energy or CERC, is the owner of the customer rate relief property. The assets of the Texas Natural Gas Securitization Finance Corporation are not available to pay creditors of CenterPoint Energy, CERC, or their affiliates. While the customer rate relief charges will be included by CERC in their monthly billings, the billing amount is established by the Railroad Commission. CERC will remit all customer rate relief charges collected to the financing entity set up by the Railroad Commission. Therefore, the collection and servicing of customer rate relief charges have no impact on the respective Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income of CenterPoint Energy or CERC. 
 
 As U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have no specific accounting guidance for government grants or assistance, the cash proceeds from the state s customer rate relief bonds were accounted for as a government grant by analogy to the grant model under IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance. CenterPoint

 Indiana Electric Securitization of Generation Retirements (CenterPoint Energy) 
 
 On January 4, 2023, the IURC issued an order in accordance with Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 386 authorizing the issuance of up to million in securitization bonds to securitize qualified costs associated with the retirements of Indiana Electric s A.B. Brown coal-fired generation facilities. Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy determined that the retirement of property, plant and equipment became probable upon the issuance of the order. No loss on abandonment was recognized in connection with issuance of the order as there was no disallowance of all or part of the cost of the abandoned property, plant and equipment. In the first quarter of 2023, upon receipt of the order, CenterPoint Energy reclassified property, plant and equipment to be recovered through securitization to a regulatory asset and such amounts continued to earn a full return until recovered through securitization. 
 
 The SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary issued million aggregate principal amount of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds on June 29, 2023. The SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds to purchase the securitization property from SIGECO. No gain or loss was recognized. 
 
 The SIGECO Securitization Bonds are secured by the securitization property, which includes the right to recover, through non-bypassable securitization charges payable by SIGECO s retail electric customers, the qualified costs of SIGECO authorized by the IURC order. The SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary, and not SIGECO, is the owner of the securitization property, and the assets of the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary are not available to pay the creditors of SIGECO or its affiliates, other than the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary. SIGECO has no payment obligations with respect to the SIGECO Securitization Bonds except to remit collections of securitization charges as set forth in a servicing agreement between SIGECO and the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary. The non-bypassable securitization charges are subject to a true-up mechanism. 
 
 Houston Electric TEEEF 
 
 Pursuant to legislation passed in 2021, Houston Electric entered into leases for TEEEF (temporary generation) which are detailed in Note 19. Houston Electric initially sought recovery of the lease costs and the applicable return as of December 31, 2021 under these lease agreements of approximately million in its DCRF application filed with the PUCT on April 5, 2022, and subsequently amended on July 1, 2022, to show temporary generation in a separate Rider TEEEF. A final order was issued on April 5, 2023 approving a revenue requirement of million that results in full recovery of costs requested but lengthens the amortization period for the short-term lease to be collected over months. On May 25, 2023, the PUCT issued its order on rehearing which clarified some of the findings, but did not change the approval of TEEEF cost recovery. The PUCT s decision on the first TEEEF filing is final and non-appealable. 
 
 On April 5, 2023, Houston Electric made its second TEEEF filing requesting recovery of TEEEF related costs incurred through December 31, 2022. Houston Electric requested a new annual revenue requirement of approximately million u sing months to amortize the related deferred costs for proposed rates beginning September 2023, a net increase in TEEEF revenues of approximately million . On August 28, 2023, the State Office of Administrative Hearings issued an Order setting interim rates to collect an annual revenue requirement at the filed amount. Interim rates became effective on September 1, 2023, subject to surcharge or refund if they differ from the final rates approved by the PUCT. An agreement in principle was reached which reduced the annual revenue requirement by approximately million based on recovering the balance as of December 31, 2022 over a month amortization period (instead of the month period in the initial filing) and also allows for revised interim rates (to incorporate the agreement in principle and the initial interim rates that have been in place since September 1, 2023). The updated interim rates were implemented on December 15, 2023 and approved by the PUCT pursuant to its order issued on February 1, 2024 when the PUCT approved the agreement in principle. The PUCT s decision on the second TEEEF filing is final and non-appealable. 
 
 On September 11, 2024, the Texas Consumer Association TCA filed a complaint with the PUCT requesting that the PUCT modify its rulings with respect to its prior decisions related to the TEEEF filings made in 2022 and 2023. Specifically, TCA requested that the PUCT end cost recovery and return on investment on all the large MW and MW TEEEF units approved in docket 53442. On October 2, 2024, Houston Electric filed a response to the TCA complaint and requested that the complaint be dismissed due to the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel. On October 8, 2024, TCA supplemented its complaint and on October 9, 2024, PUCT staff filed a statement of position stating that Houston Electric s response provided a

 million in Property, plant and equipment and million in Regulatory assets, excluding carrying costs, for such restoration costs. Based on currently available information, as of September 30, 2024, Houston Electric estimates that total costs to restore the electric delivery facilities damaged as a result of the May 2024 Storm Events will be approximately million, excluding carrying costs. These preliminary estimates are subject to revision as certain restoration costs are expected to be incurred through the end of 2025. 
 
 As is common with electric utilities serving coastal regions, the poles, towers, wires, street lights and pole-mounted equipment that comprise Houston Electric s transmission and distribution system are not covered by property insurance. Houston Electric is deferring certain storm restoration costs as management believes it is probable that such costs will be recovered through the regulatory process. The ultimate recovery of the costs (or a portion thereof) is expected to be sought through the issuance and sale of non-recourse securitization bonds for distribution-related costs and the TCOS capital mechanism for transmission-related costs. However, neither the amount nor timing of the recovery is certain. 
 
 See Note 11 for further information regarding a term loan facility to fund certain costs related to the May 2024 Storm Events. 
 
 Hurricane Beryl 
 
 On July 8, 2024, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in Texas, bringing sustained winds, storm surges and torrential rain into Houston Electric s service territory. Hurricane Beryl caused significant damage to Houston Electric s electric delivery system. Based on currently available information, as of September 30, 2024, Houston Electric estimates that total costs to restore the electric delivery facilities damaged as a result of Hurricane Beryl will be approximately billion, excluding carrying costs. As of September 30, 2024, Houston Electric had recorded million in Property, plant and equipment and million in Regulatory assets, excluding carrying costs, for such restoration costs.

 Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 As a result of classifying the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses as held for sale, CenterPoint Energy and CERC used a market approach consisting of contractual sales price adjusted for estimated working capital and other contractual purchase price adjustments to determine the fair value of the businesses classified as held for sale, which are Level 2 inputs. Neither CenterPoint Energy nor CERC recognized any gains or losses upon classification as held for sale during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 3 for further information.

 (2) If a disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. As a result, goodwill attributable to the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses to be disposed of was classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. CenterPoint Energy did not recognize any goodwill impairments within the Natural Gas reportable segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For further information, see Note 3.

 (1) In connection with the classification of the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 described above, goodwill attributable to CERC to be disposed of as part of the transaction was classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. CERC did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For further information, see Note 3. 
 
 CenterPoint Energy and CERC perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually and evaluate goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative test, if required, is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is primarily determined based on an income approach or a weighted combination of income and market approaches. When the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the excess amount is recorded as an impairment charge, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. CenterPoint Energy and CERC performed their annual goodwill impairment tests in the third quarter of 2024 and determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required for any reporting unit as a result of those tests.

 During any optional deferral period, CenterPoint Energy (and its majority-owned subsidiaries, as applicable) will not (subject to certain exceptions as described in the Junior Subordinated Notes Indenture): (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on any of CenterPoint Energy s capital stock; (ii) redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any of CenterPoint Energy s capital stock; (iii) pay any principal, interest (to the extent such interest is deferrable) or premium on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any of CenterPoint Energy s indebtedness that ranks equally with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes in right of payment (including debt securities of other series, such as the other series of the Junior Subordinated Notes issued); or (iv) make any payments with respect to any guarantees by CenterPoint Energy of any indebtedness if such guarantees rank equally with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes in right of payment. 
 
 The Junior Subordinated Notes are CenterPoint Energy s unsecured obligations and rank junior and subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment in full of CenterPoint Energy s existing and future Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Junior Subordinated Notes Indenture). Total proceeds for the sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes, net of issuance costs and transaction expenses and fees, were approximately million, which were used for general corporate purposes, including the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of CenterPoint Energy s outstanding senior notes due 2024 as further described below and the repayment of a portion of outstanding commercial paper. 
 
 Convertible Senior Notes. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2024. The Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased by CenterPoint Energy in accordance with their terms. 
 
 Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 15, 2026, the Convertible Notes are convertible only under certain conditions. On or after May 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the Convertible Notes may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at any time at the conversion rate then in effect, irrespective of the conditions. CenterPoint Energy may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date and no sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes. 
 
 Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, CenterPoint Energy will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at CenterPoint Energy s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of CenterPoint Energy s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is initially shares of Common Stock per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of Common Stock). The initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes represents a premium of approximately over the last reported sale price of the Common Stock on the NYSE on August 1, 2023. Initially, a maximum of shares of Common Stock may be issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes based on the initial maximum conversion rate of shares of Common Stock per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events (as described in the Convertible Notes Indenture) but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. 
 
 In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, CenterPoint Energy will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder of Convertible Notes who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event. If CenterPoint Energy undergoes a fundamental change (as described in the Convertible Notes Indenture), holders of the Convertible Notes may require CenterPoint Energy to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
 
 The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of CenterPoint Energy and rank senior in right of payment to any of CenterPoint Energy s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to any of CenterPoint Energy s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of CenterPoint Energy s secured indebtedness it may incur in the future to the extent of the value of the assets securing such future secured indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade

The general mortgage bonds that are held in trust to secure pollution control bonds are not reflected in Houston Electric s consolidated financial statements because of the contingent nature of the obligations. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Houston Electric could issue approximately billion of additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds and of property additions as of September 30, 2024. No first mortgage bonds are outstanding under the M DOT, and Houston Electric is contractually obligated to not issue any additional first mortgage bonds under the M DOT and is undertaking actions to release the lien of the M DOT and terminate the M DOT. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, SIGECO had approximately million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding. Generally, all of SIGECO s real and tangible property is subject to the lien of SIGECO s mortgage indenture which was amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, SIGECO was permitted to issue additional bonds under its mortgage indenture up to of then currently unfunded property additions and approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued on this basis.

(1) CenterPoint Energy s higher effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in EDIT amortization and a decrease in qualifying costs eligible for research and development tax credits. CenterPoint Energy s lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the absence of impacts associated with the sale of Energy Systems Group recorded in 2023, a decrease in state income taxes, and the tax impacts of the state deferred remeasurement benefit of million related to the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses sale, which met the held for sale criteria in the first quarter of 2024 and is described further below, partially offset by the tax impacts of the valuation allowance of million established against Louisiana and Mississippi NOLs, since those NOLs will not be utilized due to the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses sale. See Note 3 for further details. 
 (2) Houston Electric s lower effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by a decrease in state income taxes and an increase in EDIT amortization.

 million associated with the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses sale meeting the held for sale criteria during 2024. For tax purposes, when the held for sale criteria is met, the CERC and unitary state apportionment rates must be updated to account for the sale and applied to the estimated post-sale net deferred tax liability. This impact was partially offset by the tax impacts of a valuation allowance of million against Louisiana and Mississippi NOLs, since those NOLs will not be utilized due to the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses sale. 
 
 CenterPoint Energy reported a net uncertain tax liability, inclusive of interest and penalties, of million as of September 30, 2024. The Registrants believe that it is reasonably possible that the Registrants will recognize a million tax benefit, including penalties and interest, in the next 12 months as a result of a lapse of statutes on the 2020 Indiana state return. 
 
 Tax Audits and Settlements . Tax years through 2022 have been audited and settled with the IRS for CenterPoint Energy. For tax years 2023 and 2024, the Registrants are participants in the IRS s Compliance Assurance Process. Vectren s pre-Merger 2014 through 2019 tax years have been audited and settled with the IRS.

 MW Posey Solar project for a fixed purchase price over the anticipated -year life. On February 7, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a CPCN with the IURC to approve the amended BTA. With the passage of the IRA, Indiana Electric can now pursue PTCs for solar projects. Indiana Electric filed the updated CPCN with a request that project costs, net of PTCs, be recovered in rate base, through base rates or the CECA mechanism, depending on which provides more timely recovery. On September 6, 2023, the IURC issued an order approving the CPCN. The Posey Solar project is expected to be placed in service in 2025. 
 
 On January 11, 2023, the IURC issued an order approving the settlement agreement granting Indiana Electric a CPCN to purchase and acquire the MW Pike County solar project through a BTA and approved the estimated cost. The IURC also designated the project as a clean energy project as well as approved the proposed levelized rate and associated ratemaking and accounting treatment. Due to inflationary pressures, the developer disclosed that costs exceeded the agreed upon levels in the BTA. After negotiations, Indiana Electric and the developer were not able to agree upon updated pricing. As a result, on February 27, 2024, Indiana Electric provided notice that it was exercising its right to terminate the BTA, which terminated all further obligations of Indiana Electric with respect to the project.

 Excluded from the table above are estimates for cash outlays from other PPAs through Indiana Electric that do not have minimum thresholds but do require payment when energy is generated by the provider. Costs arising from certain of these commitments are pass-through costs, generally collected dollar-for-dollar from retail customers through regulator-approved cost recovery mechanisms. 
 
 (b) Guarantees (CenterPoint Energy) 
 
 On May 21, 2023, CenterPoint Energy, through Vectren Energy Services, entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell Energy Systems Group. The sale closed on June 30, 2023. See Note 3 for further information. 
 
 In the normal course of business prior to the consummation of the transaction on June 30, 2023, CenterPoint Energy, primarily through Vectren, issued parent company level guarantees supporting Energy Systems Group s obligations. When Energy Systems Group was wholly-owned by CenterPoint Energy, these guarantees did not represent incremental consolidated obligations, but rather, these guarantees represented guarantees of Energy Systems Group s obligations to allow it to conduct business without posting other forms of assurance. For those obligations where potential exposure can be estimated, management estimated the maximum exposure under these guarantees to be approximately million as of September 30, 2024 and expects the exposure to decrease pro rata. This exposure primarily relates to energy savings guarantees on federal energy savings performance contracts. Other parent company level guarantees, certain of which do not contain a cap on potential liability, were issued prior to the sale of Energy Systems Group in support of federal operations and maintenance projects for which a maximum exposure cannot be estimated based on the nature of the projects. 
 
 Under the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, ESG Holdings Group must generally use reasonable best efforts to replace existing CenterPoint Energy guarantees with credit support provided by a party other than CenterPoint Energy as of and after the closing of the transaction. The Equity Purchase Agreement also requires certain protections to be provided for any damages incurred by CenterPoint Energy in relation to these guarantees not released by closing. additional guarantees were provided by CenterPoint Energy in favor of Energy Systems Group subsequent to the closing of the sale on June 30, 2023. 
 
 While there can be no assurance that performance under any of these parent company guarantees will not be required in the future, CenterPoint Energy considers the likelihood of a material amount being incurred as remote. CenterPoint Energy believes that, from Energy Systems Group s inception in 1994 to the closing of the sale of Energy Systems Group on June 30, 2023, Energy Systems Group had a history of generally meeting its performance obligations and energy savings guarantees and its installed products operated effectively. CenterPoint Energy recorded no amounts on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 related to its obligation under the outstanding guarantees.

 Litigation Related to Hurricane Beryl. Various federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities, such as the Texas Governor s office, the Texas Legislature and the PUCT, have called for or are conducting inquiries and investigations into Hurricane Beryl, the efforts made by Houston Electric to prepare for, and respond to, this event,

 putative class actions have been filed against CenterPoint Energy and/or Houston Electric in the District Courts of Harris County, Texas, on behalf of individuals or entities who claim losses due to power outages lasting at least 48 hours as a result of Hurricane Beryl, such actions consisting of the following proposed classes: (1) all restaurants in Harris County, Galveston County, and Montgomery County; (2) all residential customers; and (3) all health, wellness, medical and beauty facilities in Harris County. These putative classes assert claims and theories of negligence, gross negligence, nuisance, fraud, and/or violation of Houston Electric s tariff for retail delivery service, and each seeks damages in excess of million for, among other things, business interruption, property damage and loss, cost of repair, loss of use and market value, lost income, nuisance, extreme mental anguish and/or punitive damages. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, an individual action has been filed in Harris County District Court asserting claims of negligence, negligence per se and gross negligence against CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric. The plaintiff in this action alleges personal injury from a power line and seeks damages in excess of million. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric intend to vigorously defend themselves against the lawsuits. CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries have general and excess liability insurance policies that provide coverage for third party bodily injury and property damage claims. Given the nature of some allegations, it is possible that the insurers could dispute coverage for some types of claims or damages that may be alleged by plaintiffs, and one of CenterPoint Energy s insurers has denied indemnity coverage in the putative class actions based on the failure to supply exclusion and has also reserved its rights with respect to coverage in those actions. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric intend to continue to pursue all available insurance coverage for all of these matters. For more information regarding Hurricane Beryl, see Note 6. 
 
 Litigation Related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event. Various legal proceedings are still pending against numerous entities with respect to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, including against CenterPoint Energy, Utility Holding, Houston Electric, and CERC. Like other Texas energy companies and TDUs, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric have become involved in certain investigations, litigation and other regulatory and legal proceedings regarding their efforts to restore power during the storm and their compliance with NERC, ERCOT and PUCT rules and directives. Additionally, like other natural gas market participants, CERC has been named in litigation alleging gas market manipulation. 
 
 CenterPoint Energy, Utility Holding, and Houston Electric, along with hundreds of other defendants (including ERCOT, power generation companies, other TDUs, natural gas producers, REPs, and other entities) have received claims and lawsuits filed by plaintiffs alleging wrongful death, personal injury, property damage and other injuries and damages. As of September 30, 2024, there were approximately pending lawsuits that are consolidated in Texas state court in Harris County, Texas, as part of the MDL proceeding related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, and CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric, along with numerous other entities, have been named as defendants in approximately of those lawsuits. of the lawsuits in the MDL is a putative class action on behalf of everyone who received electric power via the ERCOT grid and sustained a power outage between February 10, 2021 and February 28, 2021. Additionally, Utility Holding is currently named as a defendant in lawsuit in which CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric are also named as defendants. 
 
 The judge overseeing the MDL issued an initial case management order and stayed all proceedings and discovery. Per the case management order, the judge entertained dispositive motions in representative or bellwether cases and, in late January 2023, issued rulings on them. The judge ruled that ERCOT has sovereign immunity as a governmental entity and dismissed the suits against it. In a subsequent opinion in an unrelated matter, the Texas Supreme Court held that ERCOT is entitled to sovereign immunity. This ruling will apply to claims against ERCOT in the MDL. The MDL judge also dismissed all claims against the natural gas defendants (which list of natural gas defendants incorrectly included Utility Holding) and the REP defendants and some causes of action against the other defendants. CenterPoint Energy expects that the claims against Utility Holding will ultimately be dismissed in light of the judge s initial rulings. As to the TDU and generator defendants, the judge dismissed some causes of action but denied the motions to dismiss claims for negligence, gross negligence, and nuisance, which denial the TDU defendants and generator defendants asked the courts of appeals to overturn. On April 2, 2024, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourteenth District of Texas issued an opinion in the TDU mandamus proceeding, granting in part and denying in part the TDUs mandamus request. In its opinion, the panel granted the TDUs mandamus request relating to the TDUs motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claims for negligence and negligent and strict liability nuisance and ordered those claims be dismissed. The panel denied the TDUs mandamus request relating to the TDUs motion to dismiss the plaintiffs gross negligence and intentional nuisance claims. On May 22, 2024, the TDUs filed a mandamus petition with the Supreme Court of Texas, seeking dismissal of the remaining claims. On June 28, 2024, the Supreme Court of Texas requested a

 lawsuits were filed in state district court in Harris County and Tom Green County, Texas, against dozens of gas market participants in Texas, including natural gas producers, processors, pipelines, marketers, sellers, traders, gas utilities, and financial institutions. Plaintiffs named CERC as a defendant, along with CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc., incorrectly identifying it as CERC s parent company (CenterPoint Energy previously divested CES). lawsuit filed in Harris County is a putative class action on behalf of classes of electric and natural gas customers (those who experienced a loss of electricity and/or natural gas, and those who were charged securitization-related surcharges on a utility bill or were otherwise charged higher rates for electricity and/or gas during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event), potentially including millions of class members. other lawsuits filed in Harris County and in Tom Green County) are brought by an entity that purports to be an assignee of claims by tens of thousands of persons and entities that have assigned claims to the plaintiff. These, and other similar lawsuits filed in Harris County, generally allege that the defendants engaged in gas market manipulation and price gouging, including by intentionally withholding, suppressing, or diverting supplies of natural gas in connection with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, Winter Storm Elliott, and other severe weather conditions, and through financial market manipulation. Plaintiffs allege that this manipulation impacted gas supply and prices as well as the market, supply, and price of electricity in Texas and caused blackouts and other damage. Plaintiffs assert claims for tortious interference with existing contract, private nuisance, and unjust enrichment, and allege a broad array of injuries and damages, including personal injury, property damage, and harm from certain costs being securitized and passed on to ratepayers. The lawsuits do not specify the amount of damages sought, but seek broad categories of actual, compensatory, statutory, consequential, economic, and punitive damages; restitution and disgorgement; pre- and post-judgment interest; costs and attorneys fees; and other relief. As of September 30, 2024, most of the lawsuits had not been served, but the cases in which defendants were served were tagged for transfer to the existing MDL proceeding referenced above. On February 2, 2024, CERC filed pleas to the jurisdiction in the cases in which it was served; CERC also partially joined the other defendants motions to dismiss and additional pleas to the jurisdiction. On April 2, 2024, plaintiffs in the served cases filed amended petitions rather than responding to pleas to the jurisdiction and motions to dismiss. Among other changes, plaintiffs in these cases dismissed CES, but maintained the same causes of action as to the remaining defendants. CERC has vigorously defended itself against the claims raised, including filing updated pleas to the jurisdiction on May 17, 2024 in response to plaintiffs amended petitions and will continue to do so. On August 12, 2024, plaintiffs in the putative class action filed a motion for leave to amend to add additional plaintiffs/class representatives. Defendants opposed this motion on September 20, 2024. On September 23, 2024, the MDL judge heard oral argument on CERC s plea to the jurisdiction and defendants motions to dismiss and other pleas to the jurisdiction. The MDL judge has not yet issued any rulings on these motions. The other similar lawsuits filed in Harris County have also been tagged for transfer to the MDL proceeding, but the defendants, including CERC, have not been served. These gas market cases are in addition to the cases noted above regarding electric market issues. 
 
 To date, there have not been demands, quantification, disclosure or discovery of damages by any party to any of the above legal matters that are sufficient to enable CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries to estimate exposure. Given that, as well as the preliminary nature of the proceedings, the numerosity of parties and complexity of issues involved, and the uncertainties of litigation, CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the outcome or consequences of any of the foregoing matters or to estimate a range of potential losses. CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries have general and excess liability insurance policies that provide coverage for third party bodily injury and property damage claims. As CenterPoint Energy previously noted, given the nature of certain of the plaintiffs allegations, insurance coverage may not be available other than for third party bodily injury and property damage claims caused by an accident, and of CenterPoint Energy s insurers has reserved its rights with respect to coverage for plaintiffs intentional nuisance claims as well as plaintiffs claims in the gas market cases. CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries intend to continue to pursue all available insurance coverage for all of these matters.

 suits under Louisiana s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA) against hundreds of oil and gas companies seeking compensatory damages for contamination and erosion of the Louisiana coastline allegedly caused by historical oil and gas operations. of the defendants in of the lawsuits (filed in 2013 only by the Parish of Jefferson) is Primary Fuels, Inc., a predecessor company of CenterPoint Energy, which operated in Louisiana from 1983-1989. All suits were removed to Louisiana federal courts twice and were stayed for several years pending the district courts consideration of various motions to remand and multiple appeals of remand orders. Recently, several cases involving other parishes that had been remanded to Louisiana state court have begun to resume proceedings in state court. However, as of September 30, 2024, the federal district court had not ruled on Jefferson Parish s motion to remand to state court the lawsuit which includes Primary Fuels, Inc. among the defendants. 
 
 Because of the procedurally preliminary nature of the proceedings, lack of information about both the scope of and damages for Jefferson Parish s claim against Primary Fuels, Inc., the numerosity of parties and complexity of issues involved, and the uncertainties of litigation, CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the outcome or consequences of this matter or to estimate a range of potential losses. CenterPoint Energy will continue to vigorously defend itself against the claims raised and pursue any and all available insurance coverage.

 MGP Sites. CenterPoint Energy, CERC and their predecessors, including predecessors of Vectren, operated MGPs in the past. The costs CenterPoint Energy or CERC, as applicable, expect to incur to fulfill their respective obligations are estimated by management using assumptions based on actual costs incurred, the timing of expected future payments and inflation factors, among others. While CenterPoint Energy and CERC have recorded obligations for all costs which are probable and estimable, including amounts they are presently obligated to incur in connection with activities at these sites, it is possible that future events may require remedial activities which are not presently foreseen, and those costs may not be subject to PRP or insurance recovery. 
 
 (i) Minnesota MGPs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC) . With respect to certain Minnesota MGP sites, CenterPoint Energy and CERC have completed state-ordered remediation and continue state-ordered monitoring and water treatment. CenterPoint Energy and CERC recorded a liability as reflected in the table below for continued monitoring and any future remediation required by regulators in Minnesota. 
 
 (ii) Indiana MGPs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC) . In the Indiana Gas service territory, the existence, location and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites have been identified for which CenterPoint Energy and CERC may have some remedial responsibility. A remedial investigation/feasibility study was completed at of the sites under an agreed upon order between Indiana Gas and the IDEM, and a Record of Decision was issued by the IDEM in January 2000. The remaining sites have been submitted to the IDEM s VRP. CenterPoint Energy has also identified its involvement in manufactured gas plant sites in SIGECO s service territory, all of which are currently enrolled in the IDEM s VRP. CenterPoint Energy is currently conducting some level of remedial activities, including groundwater monitoring at certain sites. 
 
 (iii) Other MGPs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC). In addition to the Minnesota and Indiana sites, the EPA and other regulators have investigated MGP sites that were owned or operated by CenterPoint Energy or CERC or may have been owned by of their former affiliates.

 ash ponds, at the F.B. Culley facility (Culley East and Culley West) and at the A.B. Brown facility. Under the CCR Rule, Indiana Electric is required to perform integrity assessments, including ground water monitoring, at its F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown generating stations. The ground water studies were necessary to determine the remaining service life of the ponds and whether a pond must be retrofitted with liners or closed in place. Groundwater monitoring indicates potential groundwater impacts very close to Indiana Electric s ash impoundments, and further analysis is ongoing. The CCR Rule required companies to complete location restriction determinations by October 18, 2018. Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that F.B. Culley pond (Culley East) and the A.B. Brown pond fail the aquifer placement location restriction. As a result of this failure, Indiana Electric was required to cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by April 11, 2021, unless approved for an extension. CenterPoint Energy filed timely extension requests available under the CCR Rule that would allow Indiana Electric to continue to use the ponds through October 15, 2023. On October 5, 2022, the EPA issued a proposed conditional approval of the Part A extension request for the A.B. Brown pond. Both the Culley East and A.B. Brown facilities have been taken out of service in a timely manner per the commitments made to the EPA in the extension requests filed for both ponds. On April 24, 2019, Indiana Electric received an order from the IURC approving recovery in rates of costs associated with the closure of the Culley West pond, which has already completed closure activities. On August 14, 2019, Indiana Electric filed its petition with the IURC for recovery of costs associated with the closure of the A.B. Brown ash pond, which would include costs associated with the excavation and recycling of ponded ash. This petition was subsequently approved by the IURC on May 13, 2020. On October 28, 2020, the IURC approved Indiana Electric s ECA proceeding, which included the initiation of recovery of the federally mandated project costs. 
 
 In July 2018, Indiana Electric filed a Complaint for Damages and Declaratory Relief against its insurers seeking reimbursement of defense, investigation and pond closure costs incurred to comply with the CCR Rule, and has since reached confidential settlement agreements with its insurers. The proceeds of these settlements will offset costs that have been and will be incurred to close the ponds. 
 
 On November 1, 2022, Indiana Electric filed for a CPCN to recover federally mandated costs associated with closure of the Culley East Pond, its third and final ash pond. Indiana Electric sought accounting and ratemaking relief for the project, and on June 8, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a revised CPCN for recovery of the federally mandated ash pond costs. On February 7, 2024 the IURC approved the federally mandated costs, both incurred and projected, of million in capital costs, plus an estimated thousand in annual operation and maintenance expenses, for recovery through the ECA. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, CenterPoint Energy recorded an approximate million ARO, which represents the discounted value of future cash flow estimates to close the ponds at A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley. This estimate is subject to change due to the contractual arrangements; continued assessments of the ash, closure methods, and the timing of closure; implications of Indiana Electric s generation transition plan; changing environmental regulations; and proceeds received from

 million and million to complete the A.B. Brown closure project. 
 
 On April 25, 2024, the EPA released its final Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System; Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities; Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments rule (CCR Legacy Rule), which was published in the federal register in May 2024. The CCR Legacy Rule requires companies to investigate previously closed impoundments that were used historically for ash disposal or locations which have had ash placed on them in amounts set forth in the CCR Legacy Rule. The Registrants have completed their preliminary review of potential sites that will require further investigation under the CCR Legacy Rule and identified certain sites in Indiana for further evaluation. In September 2024, Indiana Electric recorded an approximate million ARO with a corresponding increase of million to Property, plant and equipment for amounts recoverable for electric generation stations that are currently in service. These estimates reflect the discounted value of future estimated capping costs for an area of historic ash placement at F.B. Culley. Indiana Electric will continue to refine the assumptions, engineering analyses and resulting cost estimates associated with this ARO and such refinement could materially impact the amount of the estimated ARO. 
 
 Clean Water Act Permitting of Groundwater and Power Plant Discharges . In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion providing that indirect discharges via groundwater or other non-point sources are subject to permitting and liability under the Clean Water Act when they are the functional equivalent of a direct discharge. On November 27, 2023, the EPA published draft guidance regarding the application of the functional equivalent analysis as related to permitting of certain discharges through groundwater to surface waters. The Registrants do not currently anticipate impacts from this guidance, but groundwater monitoring continues under the CCR Rule. 
 
 In 2015, the EPA finalized revisions to the existing steam electric wastewater discharge standards which set more stringent wastewater discharge limits and effectively prohibited further wet disposal of coal ash in ash ponds. In February 2019, the IURC approved Indiana Electric s Effluent Limitation Guidelines Compliance Plan for its F.B. Culley Generating Station, which was completed in compliance with the requirements of the Effluent Limitation Guidelines. On April 25, 2024, the EPA released its final Supplemental Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Generating Point Source Category. The Registrants currently anticipate that they will be in compliance with the Supplemental ELG Guidelines at the Culley facility due to previous wastewater treatment upgrades. 
 
 Other Environmental. From time to time, the Registrants identify the presence of environmental contaminants during operations or on property where their predecessors have conducted operations. Other such sites involving contaminants may be identified in the future. The Registrants have and expect to continue to remediate any identified sites consistent with state and federal legal obligations. From time to time, the Registrants have received notices, and may receive notices in the future, from regulatory authorities or others regarding status as a PRP in connection with sites found to require remediation due to the presence of environmental contaminants. In addition, the Registrants have been, or may be, named from time to time as defendants in litigation related to such sites. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted at this time, the Registrants do not expect these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Other Proceedings 
 
 The Registrants are involved in other legal, environmental, tax and regulatory proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions and governmental agencies regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, the Registrants are also defendants in legal proceedings with respect to claims brought by various plaintiffs against broad groups of participants in the energy industry. Some of these proceedings involve substantial amounts. The Registrants regularly analyze current information and, as necessary, provide accruals for probable and reasonably estimable liabilities on the eventual disposition of these matters. The Registrants do not expect the disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the Registrants financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 The following combined discussion and analysis should be read in combination with the Interim Condensed Financial Statements contained in this combined Form 10-Q and the Registrants combined 2023 Form 10-K. When discussing CenterPoint Energy s consolidated financial information, it includes the results of Houston Electric and CERC, which, along with CenterPoint Energy, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Unless the context indicates otherwise, specific references to Houston Electric and CERC also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined Form 10-Q, the terms our, we and us are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Houston Electric and CERC, unless otherwise stated. No Registrant makes any representations as to the information related solely to CenterPoint Energy or the subsidiaries of CenterPoint Energy other than itself. 

RECENT EVENTS 
 
 May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl. Houston Electric s service territory experienced sudden and destructive severe weather events in May 2024 that included hurricane-like winds and tornadoes. Subsequently, on July 8, 2024, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in Texas, bringing sustained winds, storm surges and torrential rain into Houston Electric s service territory. The May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl caused significant damage to Houston Electric s electric delivery system and resulted in electric service interruptions peaking at an estimated 922,000 customers and more than 2.1 million customers, respectively. 
 
 Various federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities, such as the Texas Governor s office, the Texas Legislature and the PUCT, have called for or are conducting inquiries and investigations into Hurricane Beryl, the efforts made by Houston Electric to prepare for, and respond to, this event, including the electric service outage issues, and the procurement of temporary generation units. Moreover, additional governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities may conduct such inquiries and investigations, as well. Texas Lieutenant Governor Patrick has publicly urged the PUCT to hold Houston Electric, rather than ratepayers, responsible for paying 800 million, which was the amount the PUCT had previously approved Houston Electric to recover from ratepayers pursuant to Texas legislation passed after the 2021 Winter Storm Event relating to emergency responsiveness and the leasing of temporary generation units. On August 12, 2024, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton opened an investigation to evaluate CenterPoint Energy s conduct during Hurricane Beryl. There are significant uncertainties around these inquiries and investigations and potential results and consequences, including whether any financial penalties will be assessed or changes to Houston Electric s system, service territories, operations and/or regulatory treatment will result therefrom. 
 
 Houston Electric announced an initial hurricane preparedness and response action plan to the PUCT on July 25, 2024 to enhance the resiliency of the electric system through various investments. Following a meeting with Texas Governor Abbott on August 1, 2024, Houston Electric publicly committed to accelerating its previously announced initial hurricane preparedness and response action plan. Additionally, Houston Electric announced that it was withdrawing both its base rate application and its application for approval of its transmission and distribution system resiliency plan with the PUCT in order to focus on addressing the impacts of Hurricane Beryl in its service territory and accelerating preparedness and resiliency efforts for the remaining storm season. The withdrawal of the system resiliency plan was granted by the PUCT. Subsequently, intervenors filed a motion to challenge the withdrawal of the base rate proceeding. On August 16, 2024, the ALJ issued an order denying the requested withdrawal of the base rate proceeding, leaving the base rate proceeding abated. Houston Electric filed an appeal of the ALJ s order to the PUCT, and on October 15, 2024, PUCT commissioners voted to consider the merits of Houston Electric s appeal at the PUCT s open meeting scheduled for November 14, 2024. The PUCT s decision on the withdrawal of the base rate proceeding is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. CenterPoint Energy cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. 
 
 On August 5, 2024, Houston Electric announced the launch of its GHRI. Subsequently, Houston Electric announced the completion of core resiliency actions as part of the first phase of its GHRI, which included certain vegetation management and pole installation goals. In September 2024, Houston Electric announced the launch of the second phase of its GHRI, which included a series of resiliency plans to install new poles, manage higher-risk vegetation and install certain automated devices prior to the start of the 2025 hurricane season as part of its efforts to strengthen grid resiliency, improve public and customer communications and strengthen local, community and emergency partnerships. Houston Electric also announced a longer-term proposal for approximately 5 billion in resiliency investment from 2026 to 2028. Houston Electric intends to include this longer-term proposal in a new transmission and distribution system resiliency plan that is expected to be filed with the PUCT on or before January 31, 2025 following feedback from customers, external experts, elected officials, local agencies and other stakeholders. Additionally, Houston Electric announced its proposal to forego approximately 110 million of profit related to its storm hardening and TEEEF efforts, which would be represented by (1) Houston Electric not seeking to recover approximately 70 million in incremental storm hardening expenses incurred in connection with accelerated operational activities after

 Hurricane Beryl; and (2) Houston Electric not filing, beginning in 2028, for approximately 40 million in anticipated equity profit associated with load-shed orientated TEEEF leased by Houston Electric through the remaining regulatory life of the leases in 2032 as new dispatchable generation is likely to come online in the state of Texas as a result of the Texas Energy Fund.

 HOUSTON ELECTRIC CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Houston Electric s CODM views net income as the measure of profit or loss for its single reportable segment. Houston Electric s results of operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for electricity. Houston Electric s results of operations are also affected by, among other things, the actions of various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over rates Houston Electric charges, debt service costs, income tax expense, Houston Electric s ability to collect receivables from REPs and Houston Electric s ability to recover its regulatory assets.

 Future Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 The liquidity and capital requirements of the Registrants are affected primarily by results of operations, capital expenditures, storm restoration costs, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs and various regulatory actions. Capital expenditures (other than expenditures associated with the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl) are expected to be used for investment in infrastructure. These capital expenditures are anticipated to enhance reliability and safety, increase resiliency and expand our systems through value-added projects. Substantial capital expenditures are also expected for restoration costs associated with the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl, as further described below. In addition to dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy s Common Stock and interest payments on debt, the Registrants principal anticipated cash requirements for the remainder of 2024 include the following:

 Indiana Electric CPCN (CenterPoint Energy) 
 
 BTAs 
 
 On February 23, 2021, Indiana Electric filed a CPCN with the IURC seeking approval to purchase the Posey Solar project. On October 27, 2021, the IURC issued an order approving the CPCN, authorizing Indiana Electric to purchase the Posey Solar project through a BTA to acquire its solar array assets for a fixed purchase price and approved recovery of costs via a levelized rate over the anticipated 35-year life. Due to community feedback and rising project costs caused by inflation and supply chain issues affecting the energy industry, Indiana Electric, along with Arevon, the developer, announced plans in January 2022 to downsize the Posey Solar project to 191 MW. Indiana Electric collaboratively agreed to the scope change, and on February 1, 2023, Indiana Electric entered into an amended and restated BTA that is contingent on further IURC review and approval. On February 7, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a CPCN with the IURC to approve the amended BTA. With the passage of the IRA, Indiana Electric can now pursue PTCs for solar projects. Indiana Electric requested that project costs, net of PTCs, be recovered in rate base rather than a levelized rate, through base rates or the CECA mechanism, depending on which provides more timely recovery. On September 6, 2023 the IURC issued an order approving the CPCN. The Posey Solar project is expected to be placed in service in 2025 and recovered through base rates. 
 
 On July 5, 2022, Indiana Electric entered into a BTA to acquire a 130 MW solar array in Pike County, Indiana through a special purpose entity for a capped purchase price. A CPCN for the project was filed with the IURC on July 29, 2022. On September 21, 2022, an agreement in principle was reached resolving all the issues between Indiana Electric and OUCC. The Stipulation and Settlement agreement was filed on October 6, 2022 and a settlement hearing was held on November 1, 2022. On January 11, 2023, the IURC issued an order approving the settlement agreement authorizing Indiana Electric to purchase and acquire the Pike County solar project through a BTA and approved the estimated cost. The IURC also designated the project as a clean energy project under applicable Indiana regulations, approved the proposed levelized rate and associated ratemaking and accounting treatment. Due to inflationary pressures, the developer disclosed that costs exceeded the agreed upon levels in the BTA. After negotiations, Indiana Electric and the developer were not able to agree upon updated pricing. As a result, on February 27, 2024, Indiana Electric provided notice that it was exercising its right to terminate the BTA, which terminated all further obligations of Indiana Electric with respect to the project. 
 
 On January 10, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a CPCN with the IURC to acquire a wind energy generating facility with installed capacity of 200 MWs through a BTA, consistent with its 2019/2020 IRP that calls for up to 300 MWs of wind 
 69 

Table of Contents 

 generation. The wind project is located in MISO s Central Region. Indiana Electric received approval from the IURC to recover the costs of the wind facility via the CECA mechanism, which is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2026. On June 6, 2023 the IURC issued an order approving the CPCN, thereby authorizing Indiana Electric to purchase the wind generating facility. However, as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, Indiana Electric has not entered into any definitive agreement relating to this wind energy generating facility, and it is not certain that a definitive agreement will be entered into at all. 
 
 PPAs 
 
 Indiana Electric also sought approval in February 2021 for a 100 MW solar PPA with Clenera LLC in Warrick County, Indiana. The request accounted for increased cost of debt related to this PPA, which provides equivalent equity return to offset imputed debt during the 25 year life of the PPA. In October 2021, the IURC approved the Warrick County solar PPA but denied the request to preemptively offset imputed debt in the PPA cost. Due to rising project costs caused by inflation and supply chain issues affecting the energy industry, Clenera LLC and Indiana Electric were compelled to renegotiate terms of the agreement to increase the PPA price. On January 17, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a request with the IURC to amend the previously approved PPA with certain modifications. Revised purchase power costs are requested to be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause proceedings over the term of the amended PPA. On May 30, 2023, the IURC approved the Warrick County solar amended PPA; however, due to MISO interconnection study delays, the developer disclosed the project in-service date would be delayed to 2026. 
 
 On August 25, 2021, Indiana Electric filed with the IURC seeking approval to purchase 185 MW of solar power, under a 15-year PPA, from Oriden , which is developing a solar project in Vermillion County, Indiana, and 150 MW of solar power, under a 20-year PPA, from Origis, which is developing a solar project in Knox County, Indiana. On May 4, 2022, the IURC issued an order approving Indiana Electric to enter into both PPAs. In March 2022, when the results of the MISO interconnection study were completed, Origis advised Indiana Electric that the costs to construct the solar project in Knox County, Indiana had increased. The increase was largely driven by escalating commodity and supply chain costs impacting manufacturers worldwide. In August 2022, Indiana Electric and Origis entered into an amended PPA, which reiterated the terms contained in the 2021 PPA with certain modifications. On February 22, 2023, the IURC approved the Knox County solar amended PPA; however, due to MISO interconnection delays, the project in-service date will be delayed from 2024 to 2026. On January 17, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a request with the IURC to amend the previously approved PPA with Oriden with certain modifications. Revised purchase power costs were approved to be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause proceedings over the term of the amended PPA with Oriden. On May 30, 2023, the IURC approved the Vermillion County solar amended PPA; however, due to MISO interconnection study delays, the developer disclosed the project in-service date would be delayed to 2026. 
 
 On May 1, 2024, Indiana Electric filed with the IURC seeking approval to purchase 147 MW of wind power under a 25-year PPA with an affiliate of NextEra Energy, Inc., which is developing a wind project in Knox County, IL. The facility is targeted to be in operation in early 2026. Indiana Electric expects a decision from the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2024. If Indiana Electric s request is approved, the purchase power costs will be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause proceedings over the term of the PPA. 
 
 Natural Gas Combustion Turbines 
 
 On June 17, 2021, Indiana Electric filed a CPCN with the IURC seeking approval to construct two natural gas combustion turbines to replace portions of its existing coal-fired generation fleet. On June 28, 2022, the IURC approved the CPCN. The estimated 334 million turbine facility is being constructed at the previous site of the A.B. Brown power plant in Posey County, Indiana and is expected to provide a combined output of 460 MW. Indiana Electric received approval for depreciation expense and post in-service carrying costs to be deferred in a regulatory asset until the date Indiana Electric s base rates include a return on and recovery of depreciation expense on the facility. A new approximately 23.5 mile pipeline will be constructed and operated by Texas Gas Transmission, LLC to supply natural gas to the turbine facility. FERC granted a certificate to construct the pipeline on October 20, 2022. The period to challenge FERC s certificate in a federal district court expired on February 20, 2023. Indiana Electric granted its contractor a full notice to proceed to construct the turbines on December 9, 2022. The facility is targeted to be operational by mid-year 2025. Recovery of the proposed natural gas combustion turbines and regulatory asset is included in the forecasted test year in the Indiana Electric rate case, which was filed with the IURC on December 5, 2023. 
 
 Culley Unit 3 Operations 
 
 In June 2022, F.B. Culley Unit 3, an Indiana Electric coal-fired electric generation unit with an installed generating capacity of 270 MW, experienced an operating issue relating to its boiler feed pump turbine. The unit returned to service in March 2023. In testimony filed September 13, 2023, the OUCC and an intervenor that represents industrial customers filed testimony with the IURC alleging that Indiana Electric did not act prudently which led to the unplanned outage and 
 70 

Table of Contents 

 recommended disallowances between 21 million to 27 million. On July 3, 2024, the IURC issued an order finding Indiana Electric acted reasonably and prudently with respect to the events that gave rise to the Culley Unit 3 outage and, in addition, did not approve the intervenors proposed disallowance. The order is now final and non-appealable. 
 
 Space City Solar Transmission Interconnection Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric) 
 
 On December 17, 2020, Houston Electric filed a CCN with the PUCT for approval to build a 345 kV transmission line in Wharton County, Texas connecting the Hillje substation on Houston Electric s transmission system to the planned 610 MW Space City Solar Generation facility being developed by third-party developer EDF Renewables. In November 2021, the PUCT approved a route that was estimated to cost 25 million and issued a final order on January 12, 2022. There have been project delays due to supply chain constraints in the developer acquiring solar panels. Houston Electric substantially completed construction in the fall of 2023, and the transmission line is expected to be energized shortly after the generation facility is complete, which is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2025. 
 
 Kilgore Transmission Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric) 
 
 On August 30, 2023, Houston Electric filed a CCN application with the PUCT for approval to build a 138 kV double circuit transmission line in Chambers County, Texas that will loop the existing 138 kV Chevron to Langston circuit number 86 on Houston Electric s transmission system to Houston Electric s planned Kilgore substation. On March 7, the PUCT issued a final order approving a route that was estimated to cost 60 million, including substation costs. The actual capital costs of the project, including the transmission line and the planned Kilgore substation, will depend on actual land acquisition costs, construction costs, and other factors. Completion of construction and energization of the line and substation is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2026. 
 
 Mill Creek Transmission Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric) 
 
 On November 17, 2023, Houston Electric filed a CCN application with the PUCT for approval to build a 138 kV double circuit transmission line in Harris and Montgomery counties, Texas that will connect Houston Electric s transmission system to Houston Electric s planned Mill Creek substation. The actual capital costs of the project, including the transmission line and the planned Mill Creek substation, will depend on actual land acquisition costs, construction costs, and other factors and have been estimated to be 62 million to 98 million, based on an amended CCN application filed by Houston Electric on February 26, 2024 and subsequent errata filed on May 9, 2024. On October 24, 2024, the PUCT heard oral arguments and indicated that they will issue a decision on this project on November 14, 2024. 
 
 Texas Legislation (CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC) 
 
 Houston Electric and CERC are also reviewing legislation passed in 2023 and associated PUCT rulemaking projects, including the following pieces of legislation that became law during the 88th Texas Legislature, including: 
 
 House Bill 1500 became effective on September 1, 2023 and continues the functions of the PUCT, the Office of Public Utility Counsel, and ERCOT through 2029. This bill also includes an amendment that clarifies the use cases under which TDUs may lease and operate temporary generation during significant power outages; 
 House Bill 2263 became effective on June 12, 2023 and authorizes LDCs to offer programs to promote energy conservation and to recover costs prudently incurred to implement such programs under Railroad Commission authority; 
 House Bill 2555 became effective on June 13, 2023 and allows an electric utility to file a transmission and distribution system resiliency plan with the PUCT and associated cost recovery to enhance its system through hardening, modernization, undergrounding certain lines, lightning mitigation measures, flood mitigation measures, information technology, cybersecurity, physical security, vegetation management and wildfire mitigation. On January 18, 2024, the PUCT issued an Order adopting its Resiliency Plan Rule (16 Tex. Admin. Code 25.62);

 Minnesota Legislation (CenterPoint Energy and CERC) 
 
 The Natural Gas Innovation Act was passed by the Minnesota legislature in June 2021 with bipartisan support. This law establishes a regulatory framework to enable the state s investor-owned natural gas utilities to provide customers with access to renewable energy resources and innovative technologies, with the goal of reducing GHG emissions and advancing the state s clean energy future. The maximum allowable cost for an innovation plan will start at 1.75 of the utility's revenue in the state and could increase to 4 by 2033, subject to review and approval by the MPUC. Specifically, the Natural Gas Innovation Act allows a natural gas utility to submit an innovation plan for approval by the MPUC which could propose the use of renewable energy resources and innovative technologies such as: 
 
 renewable natural gas (produces energy from organic materials such as wastewater, agricultural manure, food waste, agricultural or forest waste); 
 renewable hydrogen gas (produces energy from water through electrolysis with renewable electricity such as solar); 
 energy efficiency measures (avoids energy consumption in excess of the utility s existing conservation programs); and 
 innovative technologies (reduces or avoids GHG emissions using technologies such as carbon capture). 
 
 On June 28, 2023, CERC submitted its first innovation plan to the MPUC; the five-year plan includes 18 pilot projects and seven smaller research-and-development projects. These projects will deploy and evaluate a broad array of innovative resources including made-in-Minnesota alternative gases such as renewable natural gas and green hydrogen as well as pioneering technologies such as a networked geothermal district energy system and end-use carbon capture. The proposed plan requires approval from the MPUC through a review process that is expected to take about one year. The MPUC requested comments by September 15, 2023 if parties believe that the filing is incomplete based on the reporting requirements or if parties do not believe that that the MPUC s standard informal proceeding process is appropriate. No parties filed comments regarding completeness or raising concerns that the MPUC s standard informal procedural process is inappropriate. The initial comment period closed January 15, 2024, the reply comment period closed March 15, 2024 and the supplemental comment period closed May 15, 2024. On July 25, 2024, the MPUC voted to approve the plan with some minor modifications during its agenda meeting and a formal order was issued on October 9, 2024. 
 
 Solar Panel Issues (CenterPoint Energy) 
 
 CenterPoint Energy s current and future solar projects have been impacted by delays and/or increased costs. The potential delays and inflationary cost pressures communicated from the developers of our solar projects have been primarily due to (i) unavailability of solar panels and other uncertainties related to DOC anti-dumping and countervailing duties investigation(s), (ii) the December 2021 Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act on solar modules and other products manufactured in China s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and (iii) persistent general global supply chain and labor availability issues. On May 15, 2024, based on a petition filed by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, the DOC announced the initiation of antidumping and countervailing duty investigations of silicon photovoltaic cells from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. On October 1, 2024, the DOC s preliminary countervailing duty determination affirmed the petition and established preliminary duty rates. The DOC is expected to issue a preliminary antidumping determination in the fourth quarter of 2024 with final determinations expected in the first quarter of 2025. These impacts could result in cost increases for certain projects, and such impacts may require that we seek additional regulatory review and approvals. Additionally, significant changes to project costs and schedules as a result of these factors could impact the viability of the projects. For more information regarding potential delays, cancellations and supply chain disruptions, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of the Registrants combined 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 TDSIC 2.0 (CenterPoint Energy) 
 
 On May 24, 2023, Indiana Electric filed its petition and case-in-chief with the IURC requesting, among other things, approval of its five-year plan for transmission, distribution, and storage improvements (TDSIC Plan). Intervenors filed their case-in-chief on August 16, 2023 and Indiana Electric filed rebuttal on August 29, 2023. A hearing was held on September 13, 2023 and an order approving the TDSIC Plan was issued on December 27, 2023. The approved five-year TDSIC Plan, covering the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2028, consists of approximately 454 million in proposed investments across seven different programs: (1) Distribution 12kV Circuit Rebuild, (2) Distribution Underground Rebuild, (3) Distribution Automation, (4) Wood Pole Replacement, (5) Transmission Line Rebuild, (6) Substation Rebuild, and (7) Substation Physical Security. 
 
 Transmission and Distribution System Resiliency Plan (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric) 
 72 

Table of Contents 

House Bill 2555, codified as Tex. Util. Code 38.078, was passed by the 88th Texas Legislature in 2023 and allows an electric utility to file a transmission and distribution system resiliency plan with the PUCT to enhance the resiliency of the utility s transmission system through at least one or more of the following measures: hardening, modernization, undergrounding certain lines, lightning mitigation measures, flood mitigation measures, information technology, cybersecurity measures, physical security measures, vegetation management, and wildfire mitigation and response. House Bill 2555 also allows an electric utility to establish a regulatory asset for distribution-related costs, including depreciation expense and carrying costs at the electric utility s weighted average cost of capital, relating to the implementation of a transmission and distribution system resiliency plan. 
 
 On April 29, 2024, Houston Electric filed its first transmission and distribution system resiliency plan with the PUCT, which proposed to implement 25 resiliency measures over a three-year period. On August 1, 2024, Houston Electric announced that it was withdrawing its application for approval of its transmission and distribution system resiliency plan in order to focus on addressing the impacts of Hurricane Beryl and accelerating preparedness and resiliency efforts for the remaining storm season. The ALJ granted Houston Electric s request for withdrawal of the transmission and distribution system resiliency plan on August 16, 2024. 
 
 On August 28, 2024, Houston Electric announced a series of resiliency actions, including a proposal for approximately 5 billion in resiliency investment from 2026 to 2028, which Houston Electric intends to include in a transmission and distribution system resiliency plan that is expected to be filed with the PUCT on or before January 31, 2025 following feedback from customers, external experts and other stakeholders, including elected officials and local agencies. 
 
 Rate Change Applications 
 
 The Registrants are routinely involved in rate change applications before state regulatory authorities. Those applications include general rate cases, where the entire cost of service of the utility is assessed and reset. In addition, Registrants are periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its capital tracking mechanisms (e.g., CSIA, DCRF, DRR, GRIP, TCOS, ECA, CECA and TDSIC), its cost of service adjustments (e.g., RSP and RRA), its decoupling mechanism (e.g., decoupling and SRC), and its energy efficiency cost trackers (e.g., CIP, DSMA, EECR, EECRF, EEFC and EEFR). 
 
 Texas Gas Rate Case. On October 30, 2023, CERC filed an application with the Railroad Commission and municipal regulatory authorities to set new natural gas base rates that would be applied consistently across the approximately 1.9 million customers. The need for a rate change was primarily driven by the continuing investment in the safety and reliability of the natural gas system, including new Intelis natural gas meters that feature an integrated safety shutoff valve, changes to depreciation rates that better reflect the actual life and salvage characteristics of assets, and changes in other costs to serve customers. A settlement agreement was filed on April 23, 2024. The settlement agreement was approved by the Railroad Commission on June 25, 2024 and provides for a 5 million annual increase in current revenues, establishes a 9.80 ROE and a 60.61 equity ratio for future GRIP filings. New rates will be effective beginning the month of December 2024. 
 
 Minnesota Rate Case. On November 1, 2023, CERC filed an application with the MPUC requesting an adjustment to delivery charges in 2024 and 2025 for the natural gas business in Minnesota. The requested increase is approximately 6.5 or 85 million for 2024 and an additional approximately 3.7 or 52 million for 2025. The need for a rate change is primarily driven by the continuing investment in the safety and reliability of the natural gas system, including new Intelis natural gas meters that feature an integrated safety shutoff valve, changes to depreciation rates that better reflect the actual life and salvage characteristics of assets, and changes in other costs to serve customers. The request reflects a proposed 10.3 ROE on a 52.5 equity ratio. Interim rates for 2024 of 69 million, subject to refund, were implemented as of January 1, 2024. A request for interim rates of 33 million for 2025 was filed on September 30, 2024 and decision on 2025 interim rates is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. A pretrial and settlement conference is scheduled for December 16, 2024 and the anticipated decision date of the rate case is July 1, 2025. 
 
 Indiana Electric Rate Case. On December 5, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a petition with the IURC for authority to modify its rates and charges for electric utility service through a phase-in of rates. The requested increase is approximately 16 or 119 million based on a forward looking 2025 test year. The need for a rate increase is primarily driven by the continuing investment that is being made to bolster the safety and reliability of the system and normal increases in operating expenses. The initial filing of the rate case reflected a proposed 10.4 ROE on a 55 equity ratio. On April 9, 2024 Indiana Electric filed rebuttal in the rate case. Indiana Electric reached a settlement agreement with less than all parties and submitted the agreement to the IURC on May 20, 2024. The settlement reflects a proposed 9.8 ROE on a 55 equity ratio. The requested increase was lowered to 11 with an updated requested increase of 80 million. A hearing took place on September 10, 2024 through September 11, 2024. A final order is expected in the first half of 2025.

 Houston Electric Rate Case. On March 6, 2024, Houston Electric filed an application with the PUCT requesting authority to change rates and charges for electric transmission and distribution service. The requested increase is approximately 17 million (1 for retail customers and 43 million (6.6 for wholesale transmission service, excluding TCRF and rate case expenses. Texas law mandates that electric utilities file a base rate proceeding no later than every four years from the date of their last base rate proceeding final order. Houston Electric s most recent base rate proceeding order was approved by the PUCT on March 9, 2020, in Docket No. 49421. Therefore, Houston Electric was required to file its next base rate proceeding no later than March 9, 2024. The need for a rate increase is primarily driven by the continuing investment that has been made to support customer growth and to bolster the safety and reliability of Houston Electric s transmission and distribution system. The request reflects a proposed 10.4 ROE and a 45 equity ratio. Errata testimony was filed to correct minor errors included in the initial filing which reduced the requested increase to 56 million compared to current rates. Intervenor and PUCT staff testimony was filed in June 2024. Rebuttal testimony was due on July 12, 2024 and Houston Electric filed rebuttal testimony from 13 witnesses that covered issues other than operations; however, due to their significant operational responsibilities associated with Houston Electric s emergency operations plan and response to Hurricane Beryl, an extension was requested (and granted) for the operations witnesses. A hearing on the merits was scheduled to start in late July 2024. On July 17, 2024, Houston Electric filed an unopposed motion to abate the pending deadlines in order to provide additional time to facilitate the continued settlement discussions; the motion was granted on the same day. On August 1, 2024, Houston Electric announced that it was withdrawing its base rate application with the PUCT requesting authority to change rates and charges for electric transmission and distribution service in order to focus on addressing the impacts of Hurricane Beryl in its service territory and accelerating preparedness and resiliency efforts for the remaining storm season. Intervenors filed a motion to challenge the withdrawal of the base rate proceeding. PUCT staff and the Office of Public Utility Counsel filed a letter in support of such withdrawal. On August 16, 2024, the ALJ issued an order denying the requested withdrawal of the base rate proceeding, leaving the base rate proceeding abated. On August 23, 2024, Houston Electric filed an appeal of the ALJ s order to the PUCT. On September 12, 2024, the PUCT issued an order extending the time to act on Houston Electric s appeal. On October 24, 2024, the PUCT heard oral arguments on the appeal and indicated that they will decide the appeal on November 14, 2024. 
 
 Ohio CEP. On March 1, 2024, CEOH filed an application with the PUCO for authority to modify its CEP rates and charges. The requested increase is approximately 3 million resulting in a proposed CEP rate for residential customers of 1.54 per month. Per the PUCO s Opinion and Order in the 2018 general rate case, the CEP rate is capped at 1.50 per month for residential customers. CEOH requested deferral of the 2023 CEP revenue requirement above the CEP rate cap of approximately 155,000. On June 20, 2024, PUCO staff filed comments recommending that CEOH be permitted to collect 1.50 in this annual rider. However, PUCO staff recommended that CEOH be denied the opportunity to collect deferrals that exceed 1.50. PUCO staff also recommended that CEOH cease accruing deferrals until such time as a new CEP alternative regulation case has been approved and asserted the 1.50 cap was reached at some point in 2023. CEOH filed comments on July 15, 2024, providing additional clarification on its interpretation of the 2018 rate case stipulation language. CEOH s interpretation is that CEOH has complied with the PUCO s Opinion and Order from the 2018 general rate case, and CEOH plans to file a Notice of Intent to file a rate case application prior to the 1.50 cap being reached, allowing for the deferral to be maintained. CEOH filed a statement of resolution on July 30, 2024, indicating CEOH and PUCO staff agree to certain statements including: CEOH s existing deferral authority has not expired and will continue uninterrupted, provided CEOH files its notice of intent for its base rate case prior to the new CEP Rider charges taking effect. PUCO issued a Finding Order on August 21, 2024, finding that the parties resolution of the rate cap and deferral authority issues were reasonable. 
 
 Ohio Gas Rate Case . On August 27, 2024, CEOH filed a Notice of Intent with PUCO to begin the process of requesting an adjustment in natural gas base rates. CEOH plans to file its Application and Standard Filing Requirement by the end of October 2024 based on a hybrid test year of January through March 2024 results and April through December 2024 estimated financial data. Direct testimony will be filed with PUCO 14 days after the application filing. The need for a rate increase is primarily driven by the continuing investment that is being made to provide safe and reliable service of the system. CEOH s last base rate case was filed in 2018 with final PUCO approval August 28, 2019.

 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The new law extends or creates tax-related energy incentives for solar, wind and alternative clean energy sources, implements, subject to certain exceptions, a 1 tax on share repurchases after December 31, 2022, and implements a 15 CAMT based on the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations. Corporations are entitled to a CAMT credit to the extent CAMT liability exceeds regular tax liability, which can be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years when regular tax exceeds the CAMT. It is likely that the Registrants will owe CAMT in excess of their regular tax liability beginning in 2024. As a result, the Registrants may experience a temporary increase in federal cash tax liability due to this provision beginning in 2024. On September 12, 2024, the IRS issued proposed regulations addressing the application of the CAMT. The proposed regulations offer guidance for computing an entity s adjusted financial statement income, in addition to addressing other provisions of the CAMT. At this time, the Company does not anticipate changes to the applicability of CAMT to the Registrants as a result of the proposed regulations. 
 
 Greenhouse Gas Regulation and Compliance (CenterPoint Energy) 
 
 On August 3, 2015, the EPA released its CPP rule, which required a 32 reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015, and that action was immediately followed by litigation ultimately resulting in the U.S. Supreme Court staying implementation of the rule. On July 8, 2019, the EPA published the ACE rule, which (i) repealed the CPP rule; (ii) replaced the CPP rule with a program that requires states to implement a program of energy efficiency improvement targets for individual coal-fired electric generating units; and (iii) amended the implementing regulations for Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. On January 19, 2021, the majority of the ACE rule including the CPP repeal, CPP replacement, and the timing-related portions of the Section 111(d) implementing rule was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and on October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider four petitions filed by various coal interests and a coalition of 19 states. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA exceeded its authority in promulgating the CPP. On May 11, 2023, the EPA announced proposed emission limits and guidelines for carbon dioxide from fossil fuel-fired power plants under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act which, if finalized, apply new GHG performance standards for those existing coal-fired units expected to continue operation beyond December 31, 2029. On February 29, 2024, the EPA announced that it would be delaying the rulemaking as applied to existing natural gas-fired units. On April 25, 2024, the EPA released its New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Units; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule. CenterPoint Energy is currently reviewing this rule, but would note that CenterPoint Energy does not currently have plans to operate any of its coal-fired units beyond December 2029. 
 
 The Biden administration recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement, which has driven a renewed regulatory push to require further GHG emission reductions from the energy sector, and led negotiations at the global climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. On April 22, 2021, President Biden announced new goals of 50 reduction of economy-wide GHG emissions, and 100 carbon-free electricity by 2035 from a 2021 baseline, which formed the basis of the U.S. commitments announced in Glasgow. In September 2021, CenterPoint Energy announced its net zero emissions goals for both Scope 1 emissions and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035 as well as a goal to reduce certain Scope 3 emissions by 20 to 30 by 2035. Because Texas is an unregulated market, CenterPoint Energy s Scope 2 emissions estimates do not take into account Texas electric transmission and distribution assets in the line loss calculation and, in addition, exclude emissions related to purchased power in Indiana between 2024 and 2026 as estimated. CenterPoint Energy s Scope 3 emissions estimates are based on the total natural gas supply delivered to residential and commercial customers as reported in the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form EIA-176 reports and do not take into account the emissions of transport customers and emissions related to upstream extraction. These emission goals are expected to be used to position CenterPoint Energy to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements from the current and future administrations to further reduce GHG emissions. CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of their operations or would have

 the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. The IRA established the Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which imposes a charge on methane emissions from certain natural gas transmission facilities, and the EPA has proposed new regulations targeting reductions in methane emissions, which if implemented will increase costs related to production, transmission and storage of natural gas. 
 
 CenterPoint Energy s net zero emissions goals are aligned with Indiana Electric s generation transition plan and are expected to position Indiana Electric to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements related to GHG emissions reductions. Houston Electric, in contrast to some electric utilities including Indiana Electric, does not generate electricity, other than TEEEF, and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. Nevertheless, Houston Electric s and Indiana Electric s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within their respective service territories. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or to use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for the Registrants services. For example, Minnesota has enacted the Natural Gas Innovation Act that seeks to provide customers with access to renewable energy resources and innovative technologies, with the goal of reducing GHG emissions. Further, certain local government bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain specified dates. For example, Minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on natural gas. Additionally, cities in Minnesota within CenterPoint Energy s Natural Gas operational footprint are considering initiatives to eliminate natural gas use in buildings and focus on electrification. Also, Minnesota cities may consider seeking legislative authority for the ability to enact voluntary enhanced energy standards for all development projects. These initiatives could have a significant impact on CenterPoint Energy and its operations, and this impact could increase if other cities and jurisdictions in its service area enact similar initiatives. Further, our third-party suppliers, vendors and partners may also be impacted by climate change laws and regulations, which could impact CenterPoint Energy s business by, among other things, causing permitting and construction delays, project cancellations or increased project costs passed on to CenterPoint Energy. Conversely, regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to benefit CenterPoint Energy and CERC and their natural gas-related businesses. At this time, however, we cannot quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to GHG emissions, either positive or negative, on the Registrants businesses. 
 
 Compliance costs and other effects associated with climate change, reductions in GHG emissions and obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain. Although the amount of compliance costs remains uncertain, any new regulation or legislation relating to climate change will likely result in an increase in compliance costs. While the requirements of a federal or state rule remain uncertain, CenterPoint Energy will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding GHG emission standards that may affect its business. Currently, CenterPoint Energy does not purchase carbon credits. In connection with its net zero emissions goals, CenterPoint Energy is expected to purchase carbon credits in the future; however, CenterPoint Energy does not currently expect the number of credits, or cost for those credits, to be material. 
 
 Climate Change Trends and Uncertainties 
 
 As a result of increased attention regarding climate change, coupled with adverse economic conditions, availability of alternative energy sources, including private solar, microturbines, fuel cells, energy-efficient buildings and energy storage devices, and new regulations restricting emissions, including potential regulations of methane emissions, some consumers and companies may use less energy, meet their own energy needs through alternative energy sources or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for the Registrants services. As these technologies likely become more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of the Registrants systems and services, which may result in, among other things, Indiana Electric s generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels have had significant impacts on CenterPoint Energy s electric generation and natural gas businesses. For example, because Indiana Electric s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations, certain financial institutions choose not to participate in CenterPoint Energy s financing arrangements. Conversely, demand for the Registrants services may increase as a result of customer changes in response to climate change. For example, as the expected utilization of electric vehicles increases, demand for electricity may increase, resulting in increased usage of CenterPoint Energy s systems and services. Any negative opinions with respect to CenterPoint Energy s environmental practices or its ability to meet the challenges posed by climate change formed by regulators, customers, investors, legislators or other stakeholders could harm its reputation. 
 
 To address these developments, CenterPoint Energy announced its net zero emissions goals for both Scope 1 emissions and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035. Indiana Electric s 2019/2020 IRP identified a preferred portfolio that retires 730 MW of coal-fired generation facilities and replaces these resources with a mix of generating resources composed primarily of 
 78 

Table of Contents 

 renewables, including solar, wind, and solar with storage, supported by dispatchable natural gas combustion turbines including a pipeline to serve such natural gas generation. Indiana Electric continues to execute on its 2019/2020 IRP and has received initial approvals for 626 MWs of the 700-1,000 MWs identified within Indiana Electric s 2019/2020 IRP. Additionally, as reflected in its 10-year capital plan announced in September 2021, CenterPoint Energy anticipates spending over 3 billion in cleaner energy investments and enablement, which may be used to support, among other things, renewable energy generation and electric vehicle expansion. CenterPoint Energy believes its planned investments in renewable energy generation and corresponding planned reduction in its GHG emissions as part of its net zero emissions goals support global efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change. Indiana Electric has conducted a new IRP, which was submitted to the IURC in May 2023, to identify an appropriate generation resource portfolio to satisfy the needs of its customers and comply with environmental regulations. The proposed preferred portfolio is the second evolution to the generation transition plan to move away from coal-fired generation to a more sustainable portfolio of resources. Under the proposed preferred portfolio, Indiana Electric plans to convert its last remaining coal unit to natural gas by the end of 2027 and to add a significant amount of additional renewable resources through 2033. For more information regarding CenterPoint Energy s net zero emission goals and the risks associated with them, see Risk Factors Risk Factors Affecting Regulatory, Environmental and Legal Risks CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks... in Part I, Item 1A of the Registrants combined 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 To the extent climate changes result in warmer temperatures in the Registrants service territories, financial results from the Registrants businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s Natural Gas could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales. On the other hand, warmer temperatures in CenterPoint Energy s and Houston Electric s electric service territory may increase revenues from transmission and distribution and generation through increased demand for electricity used for cooling. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and flooding, including such storms as the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl. Since many of the Registrants facilities are located along or near the Texas gulf coast, increased or more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes or flooding, could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers. CenterPoint Energy s current 10-year capital plan includes capital expenditures to enhance reliability and safety and increase resiliency of its systems as climate change may result in more frequent significant weather events. Houston Electric does not own or operate any electric generation facilities other than, since September 2021, its operation of TEEEF. Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. To the extent adverse weather conditions affect the Registrants suppliers, results from their energy delivery businesses may suffer. For example, in Texas, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event caused an electricity generation shortage that was severely disruptive to Houston Electric s service territory and the wholesale generation market and also caused a reduction in available natural gas capacity. Additionally, the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl caused significant damage to Houston Electric s electric delivery system and resulted in electric service interruptions peaking at an estimated 922,000 customers and more than 2.1 million customers, respectively. When the Registrants cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers, or customers cannot receive services, the Registrants financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and they generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent the Registrants are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, the Registrants future financial results may be adversely impacted. Further, as the intensity and frequency of significant weather events continues, it may impact our ability to secure cost-efficient insurance. 
 
 On March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules that require the Registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. The final rules require Registrants to disclose, among other things, material climate-related risks, activities to mitigate such risks and information about the Registrants board of directors oversight and management s role in managing material climate-related risks. The final rule also requires the Registrants to provide information related to any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the Registrants businesses, results of operations, or financial condition. Litigation challenging the new rule was filed by multiple parties in multiple jurisdictions, which have been consolidated and assigned to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On April 4, 2024, the SEC announced that it is voluntarily delaying the implementation of the climate disclosure regulations while the U.S. Court of Appeals considers the litigation. While a majority of the reporting requirements would have been applicable to the Registrants in the fiscal year beginning in 2025, with the addition of assurance reporting for GHG inventories starting in 2029 for large accelerated filers, as of April 12, 2024, the effective date of the final rules has been delayed indefinitely and the SEC has indicated that it will publish a document in the Federal Register at the conclusion of the stay addressing a new effective date for the final rules. The Registrants continue to evaluate the impact of the final rules on their respective consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 Other Matters 
 
 Credit Facilities 
 
 The Registrants may draw on their respective revolving credit facilities from time to time to provide funds used for general corporate and limited liability company purposes, including to backstop CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s commercial paper programs. The facilities may also be utilized to obtain letters of credit. For further details related to the Registrants revolving credit facilities, see Note 11 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 Based on the consolidated debt to capitalization covenant in the Registrants revolving credit facilities, the Registrants would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of such revolving credit facilities, which aggregated approximately 4.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. As of October 21, 2024, the Registrants had the following revolving credit facilities and utilization of such facilities: 
 
 Amount Utilized as of October 21, 2024 
 Registrant Size of Facility Loans Letters of Credit Commercial Paper Weighted Average Interest Rate Termination Date (in millions) CenterPoint Energy 2,400 899 4.92 December 6, 2027 CenterPoint Energy (1) 250 December 6, 2027 Houston Electric 300 December 6, 2027 CERC 1,050 1 427 4.90 December 6, 2027 Total 4,000 1 1,326 
 (1) This credit facility was issued by SIGECO. 
 
 Borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that the borrower makes representations prior to borrowing as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary. The revolving credit facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. In each of the revolving credit facilities, the spread to SOFR and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower s credit rating. Each of the Registrant s credit facilities provide for a mechanism to replace SOFR with possible alternative benchmarks upon certain benchmark replacement events. The borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the four revolving credit facilities. 
 
 Debt Transactions 
 
 For detailed information about the Registrants debt transactions to date in 2024, see Note 11 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 Securities Registered with the SEC 
 
 On May 17, 2023, the Registrants filed a joint shelf registration statement with the SEC registering indeterminate principal amounts of Houston Electric s general mortgage bonds, CERC Corp. s senior debt securities and CenterPoint Energy s senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of shares of Common Stock, shares of preferred stock, depositary shares, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. The joint shelf registration statement will expire on May 17, 2026. For information related to the Registrants debt issuances in 2024, see Note 11 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 Additionally, for information related to shares of Common Stock sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, see Note 18 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 Temporary Investments 
 
 As of October 21, 2024, the Registrants had no temporary investments.

Table of Contents 

 Money Pool 
 
 The Registrants participate in a money pool through which they and certain of their subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the CenterPoint Energy money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CenterPoint Energy s revolving credit facility or the sale of CenterPoint Energy s commercial paper. The net funding requirements of the CERC money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CERC s revolving credit facility or the sale of CERC s commercial paper. The money pool may not provide sufficient funds to meet the Registrants cash needs. 
 
 The table below summarizes CenterPoint Energy money pool activity by Registrant as of October 21, 2024: 
 
 Weighted Average Interest Rate Houston Electric CERC (in millions) Money pool borrowings 4.98 221 
 
 Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings 
 
 The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facilities is based on each respective borrower s credit ratings. As of October 21, 2024, Moody s, S P and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to the borrowers: 
 
 Moody s S P Fitch Registrant Borrower/Instrument Rating Outlook (1) Rating Outlook (2) Rating Outlook (3) CenterPoint Energy CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Baa2 Negative 
 BBB Negative 
 BBB Negative 
 CenterPoint Energy Vectren Corp. Issuer Rating n/a Negative 
 BBB+ Negative 
 n/a n/a CenterPoint Energy SIGECO Senior Secured Debt A1 Stable 
 A Negative 
 n/a n/a Houston Electric Houston Electric Senior Secured Debt A2 Negative 
 A Negative 
 A Negative 
 CERC CERC Corp. Senior Unsecured Debt A3 Stable BBB+ Negative 
 A- Negative 
 CERC Indiana Gas Senior Unsecured Debt n/a n/a BBB+ Negative 
 n/a n/a 
 (1) A Moody s rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of an issuer s rating over the medium term. 
 (2) An S P outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. 
 (3) A Fitch rating outlook indicates the direction a rating is likely to move over a one- to two-year period. 
 
 The Registrants cannot assure that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. The Registrants note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Registrants securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of the Registrants commercial strategies. 
 
 A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under the Registrants revolving credit facilities. If the Registrants credit ratings had been downgraded one notch by S P and Moody s from the ratings that existed as of September 30, 2024, the impact on the borrowing costs under the four revolving credit facilities would have been insignificant. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact the Registrants ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market. Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s Natural Gas reportable segments. 
 
 Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper s guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody s and S P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC might need to provide cash or other collateral of up to 180 million as of September 30, 2024. The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels.

 ZENS and Securities Related to ZENS (CenterPoint Energy) 
 
 If CenterPoint Energy s creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS holders thought CenterPoint Energy s liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, some ZENS holders might decide to exchange their ZENS for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100 of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and shares of ZENS-Related Securities would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged or otherwise retired and shares of ZENS-Related Securities are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement or exchange of the ZENS. If all ZENS had been exchanged for cash on September 30, 2024, deferred taxes of approximately 787 million would have been payable in 2024. If all the ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on September 30, 2024, capital gains taxes of approximately 78 million would have been payable in 2024 based on 2024 tax rates in effect. For additional information about ZENS, see Note 10 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 Cross Defaults 
 
 Under the Registrants respective revolving credit facilities, a payment default on, or a non-payment default, event or condition that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding 125 million by the borrower or any of their respective significant subsidiaries will cause a default under such borrower s respective credit facility or term loan agreement. Under SIGECO s revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default, event or condition that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specific types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding 75 million by SIGECO or any of its significant subsidiaries will cause a default under SIGECO s credit facility. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under its subsidiaries debt instruments or revolving credit facilities. 
 
 Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures 
 
 From time to time, the Registrants consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures, strategic initiatives or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. The Registrants may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to the Registrants at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. CenterPoint Energy has increased its planned capital expenditures in its Electric and Natural Gas businesses multiple times over the recent years to support rate base growth and may continue to do so in the future. The Registrants may continue to explore asset sales as a means to efficiently finance a portion of its increased capital expenditures in the future, subject to the considerations listed above. For further information, see Note 3 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 On February 19, 2024, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. For further information, see Note 3 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 Hedging of Interest Expense for Future Debt Issuances 
 
 From time to time, the Registrants may enter into interest rate agreements to hedge, in part, volatility in the U.S. treasury rates by reducing variability in cash flows related to interest payments. For further information, see Note 7(a) to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 Collection of Receivables from REPs (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric) 
 
 Houston Electric s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. Before conducting business, a REP must register with the PUCT and must meet certain financial qualifications. Nevertheless, adverse economic conditions, weather events such as the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis, and any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric s cash flows. In the event of a REP default, Houston Electric s tariff provides a number of remedies, 
 82 

Table of Contents 

 including the option for Houston Electric to request that the PUCT suspend or revoke the certification of the REP. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. However, Houston Electric remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement REP or the provider of last resort. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against Houston Electric involving payments it had received from such REP. If a REP were to file for bankruptcy, Houston Electric may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such REP that are unpaid as of the date the REP filed for bankruptcy. However, PUCT regulations authorize utilities, such as Houston Electric, to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in future rate cases, subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity. 
 
 Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements 
 
 In addition to the above factors, the Registrants liquidity and capital resources could also be negatively affected by: 
 
 cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including weather hedging arrangements, and natural gas purchases, natural gas price and natural gas storage activities of CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s Natural Gas reportable segment; 
 acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased natural gas prices, and concentration of natural gas suppliers (CenterPoint Energy and CERC); 
 increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC); 
 increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities or term loans or the use of alternative sources of financings, including financings due to the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl; 
 various legislative or regulatory actions, including such actions in response to the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl; 
 incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives (CenterPoint Energy); 
 the ability of REPs, including REP affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., to satisfy their obligations to CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric; 
 slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher natural gas prices, changing economic conditions, public health threats or severe weather events, such as the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl (CenterPoint Energy and CERC); 
 the satisfaction of any obligations pursuant to guarantees; 
 the outcome of litigation, including litigation related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and Hurricane Beryl; 
 contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans; 
 recovery of any losses under applicable insurance policies; 
 restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes or other severe weather events, such as the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl, and the timing of and amounts sought for recovery of such restoration costs; and 
 various other risks identified in Risk Factors in Part I, I tem 1A of the Registrants combined 2023 Form 10-K , which are incorporated herein by reference, in Item 1A of Part II of this combined Form 10-Q, and in other reports that the Registrants file from time to time with the SEC. 
 
 Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money 
 
 Certain provisions in certain note purchase agreements relating to debt issued by CERC have the effect of restricting the amount of secured debt issued by CERC and debt issued by subsidiaries of CERC Corp. Additionally, Houston Electric and SIGECO are limited in the amount of mortgage bonds they can issue by the General Mortgage and SIGECO s mortgage indenture, respectively. For information about the total debt to capitalization financial covenants in the Registrants and SIGECO s revolving credit facilities, see Note 11 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of the Registrants financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in the Registrants historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require the Registrants to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that the Registrants could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The circumstances 
 83 

Table of Contents 

 that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. The Registrants base their estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Registrants operating environment changes. 
 
 Assets Held for Sale 
 
 Generally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell, and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. The Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale, or the disposal group, at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell. If a disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. Goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as described further in Note 3 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements, certain assets and liabilities representing the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses met the held for sale criteria. The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes, requiring net deferred tax liabilities to be excluded from held for sale balances. 
 
 Fair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value could be different if different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques were applied. 
 
 Fair value measurements require significant judgment and often unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the resulting fair value. 
 
 Other than the assets held for sale analysis discussed above, there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the critical accounting policies disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Registrants combined 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Houston Electric and CERC meet the conditions specified in General Instruction H(1)(a) and (b) to Form 10-Q and are therefore permitted to use the reduced disclosure format for wholly-owned subsidiaries of reporting companies. Accordingly, Houston Electric and CERC have omitted from this report the information called for by Item 3 (Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk) of Part I of the Form 10-Q. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk (CenterPoint Energy) 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Registrants had outstanding long-term debt and lease obligations and CenterPoint Energy had obligations under its ZENS that subject them to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. The Registrants seek to manage interest rate exposure by monitoring the effects of changes in market interest rates and using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. Additionally, interest rate swaps are used to mitigate interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate. See Note 7 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements. 
 
 CenterPoint Energy s floating rate obligations aggregated 1.3 billion and 1.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. If the floating interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points from September 30, 2024 rates, CenterPoint Energy s combined interest expense would increase by approximately 13 million annually. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, CenterPoint Energy had outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding indexed debt securities) aggregating 18.7 billion and 16.9 billion, respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of 18.1 billion and 16.1 billion, respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose CenterPoint Energy to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would

 increase by approximately 715 million if interest rates were to decline by 10 from levels at September 30, 2024. In general, such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if CenterPoint Energy were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity. 
 
 The ZENS obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component. The debt component of 3 million as of September 30, 2024 was a fixed-rate obligation and, therefore, did not expose CenterPoint Energy to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of the debt component would increase by less than 1 million if interest rates were to decline by 10 from levels at September 30, 2024. Changes in the fair value of the derivative component, a 591 million recorded liability at September 30, 2024, are recorded in CenterPoint Energy s Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income and, therefore, it is exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk-free interest rate. If the risk-free interest rate were to increase by 10 from September 30, 2024 levels, the fair value of the derivative component liability would decrease by 1 million, which would be recorded as a gain on indexed debt securities in CenterPoint Energy s Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income. 
 
 Equity Market Value Risk (CenterPoint Energy) 
 
 CenterPoint Energy is exposed to equity market value risk through its ownership of 10.2 million shares of AT T Common, 0.9 million shares of Charter Common and 2.5 million shares of WBD Common, which CenterPoint Energy holds to facilitate its ability to meet its obligations under the ZENS. See Note 10 to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements for a discussion of CenterPoint Energy s ZENS obligation. Changes in the fair value of the ZENS-Related Securities held by CenterPoint Energy are expected to substantially offset changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the ZENS. A decrease of 10 from the September 30, 2024 aggregate market value of these shares would result in a net loss of less than 1 million, which would be recorded on a gross basis as both a gain on indexed debt securities and as a loss on equity securities in CenterPoint Energy s Condensed Statements of Consolidated Income. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk From Non-Trading Activities (CenterPoint Energy and CERC) 
 
 CenterPoint Energy s regulated operations are exposed to commodity price risk during severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes and severe winter weather conditions. Severe weather events can increase commodity prices related to natural gas, coal and purchased power, which may increase our costs of providing service, and those costs may not be recoverable in rates. Recovery of cost increases driven by rising commodity prices during severe weather events could be resisted by our regulators and our regulators might attempt to deny or defer timely recovery of those costs. 
 
 However, CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s regulated operations in Indiana have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas, coal and purchased power for the benefit of retail customers due to current state regulations, which, subject to compliance with those regulations, allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms. CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s utility natural gas operations in Indiana have regulatory authority to lock in pricing for up to 50 of annual natural gas purchases using arrangements with an original term of up to 10 years. This authority has been utilized to secure fixed price natural gas using both physical purchases and financial derivatives. As of September 30, 2024, the recorded fair value of non-trading energy derivative liabilities was 7 million and 6 million, respectively, for CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s utility natural gas operations in Indiana. 
 
 Although CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk, natural gas and coal prices have other effects on working capital requirements, interest costs, and some level of price-sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered. Constructive regulatory orders, such as those authorizing lost margin recovery, other innovative rate designs and recovery of unaccounted for natural gas and other natural gas-related expenses, also mitigate the effect natural gas costs may have on CenterPoint Energy s financial condition. In 2008, the PUCO approved an exit of the merchant function in CenterPoint Energy s and CERC s Ohio natural gas service territory, allowing Ohio customers to purchase substantially all natural gas directly from retail marketers rather than from CenterPoint Energy or CERC. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, the Registrants carried out separate evaluations, under the supervision and with the participation of each company s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on those evaluations, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, in each case, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management,

 including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
 
 There has been no change in the Registrants internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 For a description of material legal and regulatory proceedings, including environmental legal proceedings that involve a governmental authority as a party and that the Registrants reasonably believe would result in 1,000,000 or more of monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, under federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, affecting the Registrants, see Note 13(c) to the Interim Condensed Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Future Sources and Uses of Cash and Regulatory Matters, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. See also Business Regulation and Environmental Matters in Part I, Item 1 and Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of the Registrants combined 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Other than with respect to the risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the Registrants combined 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Hurricane Beryl caused severe disruptions to our operations, customers and markets in certain of our service territories and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 
 
 In July 2024, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in Texas, bringing sustained winds, storm surges and torrential rain, which impacted our operations, customers and personnel in our Texas gulf coast markets. Hurricane Beryl caused significant damage to Houston Electric s electric delivery system, resulting in a substantial number of its customers (peaking at more than 2.1 million customers out of 2.8 million customers) being without power, many for extended periods of time. 
 
 The total cost for the restoration of Houston Electric s electric delivery facilities as a result of Hurricane Beryl is currently estimated to be 1.1 billion, excluding carrying costs, but such estimate is preliminary and restoration costs could vary from that estimate. Houston Electric believes it is entitled to recover prudently incurred storm restoration costs in accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. However, neither the amount nor timing of the recovery is certain. Houston Electric s failure to recover costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Beryl could adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and financial condition. 
 
 Various federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities, such as the Texas Governor s office, the Texas Legislature and the PUCT, have called for or are conducting inquiries and investigations into Hurricane Beryl and the efforts made by Houston Electric to prepare for, and respond to, this event, including the electric service outage issues. Moreover, additional governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities may conduct such inquiries and investigations, as well. Texas Lieutenant Governor Patrick has publicly urged the PUCT to hold Houston Electric, rather than ratepayers, responsible for paying 800 million, which was the amount the PUCT had previously approved Houston Electric to recover from ratepayers pursuant to Texas legislation passed after the 2021 Winter Storm Event relating to emergency responsiveness and the leasing of temporary generation units. On August 12, 2024, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton opened an investigation to evaluate CenterPoint Energy s conduct during Hurricane Beryl. There are significant uncertainties around these inquiries and investigations and potential results and consequences, including whether any financial penalties will be assessed or changes to Houston Electric s system, service territories, operations and/or regulatory treatment will result therefrom. If these or other inquiries, investigations or reviews ultimately result in changes to Houston Electric s system, service territories, operations and/or regulatory treatment, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 
 CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric are subject to current and potential future litigation and claims arising out of Hurricane Beryl, which litigation and claims could include allegations of, among other things, personal injury, property damage, various economic losses in connection with loss of power, unlawful business practices, and others. Several lawsuits have been filed against CenterPoint Energy and/or Houston Electric, including three putative class actions claiming losses due 
 86 

Table of Contents 

 to power outages following Hurricane Beryl and each seeking damages in excess of 100 million for, among other things, business interruption, property damage and loss, cost of repair, loss of use and market value, lost income, nuisance, extreme mental anguish and/or punitive damages. CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries have general and excess liability insurance policies that provide coverage for third party bodily injury and property damage claims. Given the nature of some allegations, it is possible that the insurers could dispute coverage for some types of claims or damages that may be alleged by plaintiffs, and one of CenterPoint Energy s insurers has denied indemnity coverage in the putative class actions based on the failure to supply exclusion and has also reserved its rights with respect to coverage in those actions. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric intend to continue to pursue all available insurance coverage for all of these matters. While CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric intend to vigorously defend themselves against the lawsuits, final resolution of these matters, or any potential future claims or liabilities, may require expenditures that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and liquidity.

If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.10, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.

At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security, (ii) defaults in the performance of its duties as Depositary, or (iii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as depositary, in each case, unless the Company has approved a successor Depositary within 90 days, (B) the Company in its sole discretion determines that such Global Security will be so exchangeable or transferable or (C) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 3.01.

Section 3.06 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee together with such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and shall cancel and destroy such mutilated Security. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 29 and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section 3.06 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section 3.06 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and interest on the Securities of each series for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the number of days elapsed in any partial month. The amount of interest (or amounts deemed to be interest under applicable law) payable or paid on any Security shall be limited to an amount which shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the maximum nonusurious rate of interest allowed by the applicable laws of the State of Texas or (ii) the maximum nonusurious rate of interest allowed by the applicable laws of the State of New York, or any applicable law of the United States permitting a higher maximum nonusurious rate that preempts such applicable Texas and New York laws, which could lawfully be contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received (the Maximum Interest Rate ). If, as a result of any circumstances whatsoever, the Company or any other Person is deemed to have paid interest (or amounts deemed to be interest under applicable law) or any Holder of a Security is deemed to have contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received interest (or amounts deemed to be interest under applicable law), in excess of the Maximum Interest Rate, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of validity, and if from any such circumstance, the Trustee, acting on behalf of the Holders, or any Holder shall ever receive interest or anything that might be deemed interest under applicable law that would exceed the Maximum Interest Rate, such amount that would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the applicable Security or Securities and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid principal balance of any such Security or Securities, such excess shall be refunded to the Company. In addition, for purposes of determining whether payments in respect of any Security are usurious, all sums paid or agreed to be paid with respect to such Security for the use, forbearance or detention of money shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such Security. 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 34 Section 3.12 CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may use CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in CUSIP numbers. ARTICLE IV SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE Section 4.01 Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture. This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for and as otherwise provided in this Section 4.01), and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when (a) either (i) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.06 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.03) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (ii) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (A) have become due and payable, or (B) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year of the date of deposit, or (C) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (A), (B) or (C) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose money in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 35 (b) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (c) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.07, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.14 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (ii) of Clause (A) of this Section 4.01, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.02 and the last paragraph of Section 10.03 shall survive. Section 4.02 Application of Trust Money. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.03, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.01 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee. ARTICLE V REMEDIES Section 5.01 Events of Default. Event of Default , wherever used herein with respect to the Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be occasioned by the provisions of Article XVI or be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (a) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or (b) default in the payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security of that series at its Maturity; or (c) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series; or (d) default in the performance, or breach, in any material respect, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture with respect to a Security of that series (other than a covenant or warranty a default in the performance of which or the breach of which is elsewhere in this Section 5.01 specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 36 mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a Notice of Default under this Indenture; or (e) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (i) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (ii) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or (f) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or state law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment of a substantial part of its property for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or (g) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series; provided, however, that no event described in Clause (d) above shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder until a Responsible Officer assigned to and working in the Trustee s corporate trust department has received written notice thereof as contemplated in Section 6.02. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.01, if the principal or any premium or interest on any Security is payable in a currency other than the currency of the United States of America and such currency is not available to the Company for making payment thereof due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders of the Securities by making such payment in the currency of the United States of America in an amount equal to the currency of the United States of America equivalent of the amount payable in such other currency, as determined by the Trustee by reference to the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers for such currency Exchange Rate ), as such Exchange Rate is reported or otherwise made available by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the date of such payment, or, if such rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available Exchange Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.01, any payment made under such 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 37 circumstances in the currency of the United States of America where the required payment is in a currency other than the currency of the United States of America will not constitute an Event of Default under this Indenture. Section 5.02 Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If an Event of Default (other than (a) an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(g) which is common to all Outstanding series of Securities or (b) an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(e) or 5.01(f)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default under Section 5.01(g) which is common to all Outstanding series of Securities occurs and is continuing, then in such case, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25 in aggregate principal amount of all the Securities then Outstanding hereunder (treated as one class), by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders) may declare the principal amount (or, if any Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified by the terms thereof) of all the Securities then Outstanding to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(e) or 5.01(f) with respect to the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, then in such case the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter provided in this Article V, the Event of Default giving rise to such declaration of acceleration shall, without further act, be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if: (a) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay: (i) all overdue installments of interest on all Securities of that series, (ii) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, (iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 38 (iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and (b) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 5.03 Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee. The Company covenants that if: (a) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or (b) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, all amounts owing the Trustee, its agents and counsel under Section 6.07. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. Section 5.04 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.07. No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 39 authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors or other similar committee. Section 5.05 Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.07, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. Section 5.06 Application of Money Collected. Any money or property collected or to be applied by the Trustee with respect to a series of Securities pursuant to this Article V shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money or property on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee, including in its other capacities provided for herein, under Section 6.07; SECOND: Subject to Article XVI, to the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and any premium and interest on such series of Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such series of Securities for principal and any premium and interest, respectively; and THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company. Section 5.07 Limitation on Suits. No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator or sequestrator (or other similar official), or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (a) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series; (b) the Holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 40 (c) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (d) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of security or indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (e) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing itself of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders. Section 5.08 Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 3.07) interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. Section 5.09 Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. Section 5.10 Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.06, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 41 Section 5.11 Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article V or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. Section 5.12 Control by Holders. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and (c) subject to the provisions of Section 6.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow such direction if a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee shall, in good faith, determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or would otherwise be contrary to applicable law.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default (a) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series or (b) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 5.14 Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 42 any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions of this Section 5.14 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder or group of Holders holding in the aggregate more than 10 in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security. Neither this Section 5.14 nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or such an assessment in any proceeding instituted by the Company. Section 5.15 Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent. The provisions of this Section 6.07 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the termination of this Indenture. In the event the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in any proceedings which result from an Event of Default under Section 5.01(e) or (f), or from any default which, with the passage of time, would become such Event of Default, the expenses so incurred and compensation for services so rendered are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the United States Bankruptcy Code or equivalent law.

The Company initially appoints the Trustee, acting through its Corporate Trust Office, as its agent for said purpose.

ACTIVE 119991020.5 57 designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will provide to a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of Securities of any series by the Holder s acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article XVI, subject to the provisions of Article IV and except as may otherwise be specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 and set forth in the Securities of a series, the indebtedness represented by the Securities of such series and the payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on each and all of the Securities of such series are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all amounts then due and payable in respect of all Senior Debt of the Company, to the extent and in the manner herein set forth (unless a different manner is set forth in the Securities of such series). No provision of this Article shall prevent the occurrence of any default or Event of Default hereunder. Senior Debt shall not be deemed to have been paid in full unless the holders thereof shall have received cash, securities or other property equal to the amount of such Senior Debt then outstanding. 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 69 Section 16.02 Payment over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc.. In the event of (a) any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition or other similar proceeding in respect of the Company or its property, (b) any proceeding for the liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or bankruptcy proceedings, (c) any assignment by the Company for the benefit of its creditors, (d) any other marshalling of the assets of the Company, all Senior Debt shall first be paid in full before any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made by the Company on account of the Securities of any series. Any payment or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property (other than securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan or reorganization or a readjustment, the payment of which is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in these subordination provisions with respect to the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities of any series, to the payment of all Senior Debt at the time outstanding and to any securities issued in respect thereof under any such plan of reorganization or readjustment), which would otherwise (but for these subordination provisions) be payable or deliverable in respect of the Securities of any series shall be paid or delivered directly to the holders of Senior Debt in accordance with the priorities then existing among such holders until all Senior Debt shall have been paid in full. No present or future holder of any Senior Debt shall be prejudiced in the right to enforce subordination of the indebtedness constituting the Securities of any series by any act of failure to act on the part of the Company. Section 16.03 No Payment When Senior Debt in Default. Except as may otherwise be specified in respect of Securities of a series as contemplated by Section 3.01(w) hereof, in the event that (a) the Company shall default in the payment of any principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Debt when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or at a date fixed for prepayment or declaration or otherwise, or (b) an event of default occurs with respect to any Senior Debt permitting the holders thereof to accelerate the maturity thereof and written notice describing such event of default and requesting commencement of payment blockage on transactions as thereinafter described is given to the Company by the holders of Senior Debt, then, unless and until such default in payment and event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist, no direct or indirect payment (in cash, property, securities, by set-off or otherwise) shall be made or agreed to be made on account of the Securities of any series or any interest thereon in respect of any repayment, redemption, retirement, purchase or other acquisition of the Securities of any series. 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 70 Section 16.04 Prior Payment to Senior Debt Upon Acceleration of Securities. In the event that any Securities are declared due and payable before their Stated Maturity, then and in such event the holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all Senior Debt, or provision shall be made for such payment in cash or cash equivalents, before the Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive any payment (including any payment which may be payable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Securities) by the Company on account of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the satisfaction of any sinking fund payment in accordance with Article XII by delivering and crediting pursuant to Section 12.02 Outstanding Securities which have been acquired (upon redemption or otherwise) prior to such declaration of acceleration. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company. Section 16.05 Payment Permitted in Certain Situations. Nothing contained in this Article XVI or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any of the Securities of any series shall prevent (a) the Company, at any time except during the pendency of any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings of the Company referred to in Section 16.02 or under the conditions described in Section 16.03 or as may be specified in respect of Securities of a series as contemplated by Section 3.01(w) hereof, from making payments at any time of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of such series, or (b) the application by the Trustee of any money deposited with it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of such series or the retention of such payment by the Holders, if, at the time of such application by the Trustee, it did not have knowledge that such payment would have been prohibited by the provisions of this Article XVI. Section 16.06 Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior Debt. Upon the payment in full of all Senior Debt, the rights of the holders of Securities of any series shall be subrogated to all the rights of any holders of Senior Debt to receive any further payments or distributions applicable to the Senior Debt until the Securities of any series shall have been paid in full, and such payments or distributions received by the Holders of Securities of any series by reason of such subrogation, of cash, securities or other property which otherwise would be paid or distributed to the holders of Senior Debt, shall, as between the Company and its creditors other than the holders of Senior Debt, on the one hand, and the Holders of Securities of any series, 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 71 on the other, be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of Senior Debt, and not on account of the Securities of any series. Section 16.07 Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights. The provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of Securities of any series on the one hand and the holders of Senior Debt on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in the Indenture or in the Securities of such series is intended to or shall (a) impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Debt and the Holders of Securities of such series, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional (and which, subject to the rights under this Article XVI of the holders of Senior Debt, is intended to rank equally with all other general obligations of the Company), to pay to the Holders of Securities of such series the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms; (b) affect the relative rights against the Company of the Holders of Securities of such series and creditors of the Company, as the case may be, other than the holders of Senior Debt; or (c) prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Securities of such series from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of Senior Debt to receive cash, property and securities otherwise payable or deliverable to the Trustee or such Holder. Section 16.08 Trustee to Effectuate Subordination. Each Holder of Securities of any series by such Holder s acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on such Holder s behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge and effectuate the subordination provided in this Article and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Section 16.09 No Waiver of Subordination Provisions. No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Debt may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities of any series, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Securities of such series and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article XVI or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of Securities of such series to the holders of Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following: 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 72 (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Debt, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Debt is outstanding; (b) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Debt; (c) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Debt; and (d) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person. Section 16.10 Notice to Trustee. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities of any series pursuant to the provisions of this Article XVI. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XVI or any other provision of the Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of any Securities of any series pursuant to the provisions of this Article XVI, unless and until the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or a holder or holders of Senior Debt or from any trustee therefor; and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.03, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist; provided, however, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in this Section at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Securities of any series), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to such date. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.03, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Debt (or a trustee therefor) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Debt (or a trustee therefor). In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article XVI, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article XVI, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 73 Section 16.11 Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of Liquidating Agent. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article XVI, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.03, and the Holders of Securities of any series shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities of such series, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article XVI. Section 16.12 Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Debt. With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article XVI, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of such Senior Debt shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt with respect to its obligations and duties created hereunder and shall not be liable to any such holders or creditors if it shall in good faith pay over or distribute to Holders of Securities of any series or to the Company or to any other Person cash, property or securities to which any holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Article XVI or otherwise. Section 16.13 Rights of Trustee as Holder of Senior Debt; Preservation of Trustee s Rights. The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Senior Debt which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Debt, and nothing in the Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article XVI shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.07. Section 16.14 Article Applicable to Paying Agents. In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term Trustee as used in this Article XVI shall in such case (unless the context otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article XVI in addition to or in place of the Trustee; provided, however, that this Section 16.14 shall not apply to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as Paying Agent. 

ACTIVE 119991020.5 74 Section 16.15 Certain Conversions or Exchanges Deemed Payment. For the purposes of this Article XVI only, (a) the issuance and delivery of securities which are subordinate in right of payment to all then outstanding Senior Debt to substantially the same extent as the Securities are so subordinate Junior Securities (or cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) upon conversion or exchange of Securities of any series as contemplated by Section 3.01, shall not be deemed to constitute a payment or distribution on account of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on Securities of such series or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities of such series and (b) the payment, issuance or delivery of cash, property or securities (other than Junior Securities and cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) upon conversion or exchange of Securities of any series shall be deemed to constitute payment on account of the principal of such Securities of such series. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in the Indenture or in the Securities of any series is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Debt and the Holders of Securities of such series the right, which is absolute and unconditional, of the Holder of any Securities of such series to convert or exchange such Securities of such series in accordance with the terms specified as contemplated by Section 3.01. Section 16.16 Defeasance of This Article XVI. The subordination of the Securities provided by this Article XVI is expressly made subject to the provisions for defeasance or covenant defeasance in Article XIV hereof and, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the effectiveness of any such defeasance or covenant defeasance, the Securities then outstanding shall thereupon cease to be subordinated pursuant to this Article XVI.

2 (b) the terms defined in this Article have the meanings assigned to them in this Article and include the plural as well as the singular; (c) all other terms used herein which are defined in the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, whether directly or by reference therein, have the meanings assigned to them therein; (d) a reference to a Section or Article is to a Section or Article of this Supplemental Indenture unless otherwise stated; (e) a reference to a Section or Article in the Base Indenture that has been replaced or amended in this Supplemental Indenture shall be construed for purposes of the Notes to refer to such Section or Article as replaced or amended in this Supplemental Indenture; (f) the words herein, hereof and hereunder and other words of similar import refer to this Supplemental Indenture as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other subdivision; (g) headings are for convenience of reference only and do not affect interpretation; Business Day means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is authorized or required by law or executive order to close or be closed.

If the Five-Year Treasury Rate cannot be determined pursuant to the method described above, the Calculation Agent, after 

3 consulting such sources as it deems comparable to any of the foregoing calculations, or any such source as it deems reasonable from which to estimate the Five-Year Treasury Rate, will determine the Five-Year Treasury Rate in its sole discretion, provided that if the Calculation Agent determines there is an industry-accepted successor Five-Year Treasury Rate, then the Calculation Agent will use such successor rate.

Guarantee means any obligation, contingent or otherwise, of any Person directly or indirectly guaranteeing any Indebtedness or other obligation of any other Person and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any obligation, direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise, of such Person (i) to purchase or pay (or advance or supply funds for the purchase or payment of) such Indebtedness or other obligation of such other Person (whether arising by virtue of partnership arrangements, or by agreement to keep well, to purchase assets, goods, securities or services, to take-or-pay, or to maintain financial statement conditions or otherwise) or (ii) entered into for purposes of assuring in any other manner the obligee of such Indebtedness of other obligation of the payment thereof or to protect such obligee against loss in respect thereof (in whole or in part); provided that the term Guarantee shall not include endorsements for collection or deposit in the ordinary course of business.

For the protection and enforcement of this Section 3.05, each and every Holder of such series of Notes and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.

Section 3.06 Proceedings by Trustee. In case of an Event of Default, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as are necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by suit in equity or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law. Section 3.07 Remedies Cumulative and Continuing. Except as provided in Section 3.06 of the Base Indenture, all powers and remedies given by this Article III to the Trustee or to the Holders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the Holders of a series of Notes, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any of such series of Notes to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or any acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 3.05, every power and remedy given by this Article III or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders.

The Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of a series at the time Outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series of Notes; provided, however, that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee and that is not inconsistent with such direction. The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that it determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not any such direction is unduly prejudicial to the rights of another Holder) or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of a series at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes of such series waive any past Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except any continuing defaults relating to (i) a default in the payment of accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, or the principal (including any redemption price) of, the Notes of such series when due that has not been cured pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.08, or (ii) a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX of the Base Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of the Notes of such series affected. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes of such series 

17 shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 3.08, said Default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Notes of such Series and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 3.09 Notice of Defaults. If a Default occurs and is continuing and a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives written notice of such Default, the Trustee shall deliver to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives such notice or obtains actual knowledge thereof, unless such Defaults shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice; provided that, except in the case of a Default in the payment of the principal of (including the redemption price, if applicable), or accrued and unpaid interest on, any of the Notes, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as it determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders.

All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any series of Note by its acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may, in its discretion, require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions of this Section 3.10 (to the extent permitted by law) shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10 in principal amount of a series of Notes at the time Outstanding, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on any Note of a series (including, but not limited to, the redemption price, if applicable) on or after the due date expressed or provided for in such Note. ARTICLE IV OPTION TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS Section 4.01 Option to Defer Interest Payments. (a) The Company may, at its option, elect at one or more times to defer payment of interest on a given series of the Notes, from time to time, for one or more consecutive Interest Periods (each, an Optional Deferral Period of up to 20 consecutive Interest Payment Periods (each period commencing on the date that the first such Interest Payment would otherwise have been made on the applicable series of Notes); provided that the Company may not elect to defer payment of interest on a given series of Notes if an Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes has occurred and is continuing; provided, further, that the deferral of Interest Payments cannot extend beyond the maturity date of the applicable 

18 series of Notes or end on a day other than the day immediately preceding an Interest Payment Date. (b) The Company may pay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued to that point during an Optional Deferral Period. At the end of the Optional Deferral Period or on any redemption date, the Company will be obligated to pay all accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may not pay current interest on a series of Notes until it has paid all accrued interest on such series of Notes from the previous Optional Deferral Period. (c) Once all accrued and unpaid interest on a given series of the Notes has been paid, the Company again can defer Interest Payments on that series of Notes as described above, provided that an Optional Deferral Period cannot extend beyond the maturity date of such Notes. (d) Before the end of any Optional Deferral Period that is shorter than 20 consecutive Interest Payment Periods, the Company may elect, at its option, to extend such Optional Deferral Period, so long as the entire Optional Deferral Period does not exceed 20 consecutive Interest Payment Periods or extend beyond the maturity date of the Notes of the applicable series. The Company may also elect, at its option, to shorten the length of any Optional Deferral Period. No Optional Deferral Period (including as extended or shortened) may end on a day other than the day immediately preceding an Interest Payment Date. At the end of any Optional Deferral Period, if all amounts then due on the Notes of the applicable series, including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon (including, without limitation and to the extent permitted by applicable law, any deferred interest and any Compound Interest), are paid, the Company may elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period; provided, however, that, without limitation of the foregoing, the Company may not begin a new Optional Deferral Period unless the Company has paid all accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes of the applicable series (including, without limitation and to the extent permitted by applicable law, any deferred interest and any Compound Interest) from any previous Optional Deferral Period. (e) If the Company defers interest for a period of 20 consecutive Interest Payment Periods from the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period, the Company will be required to pay all accrued and unpaid interest at the conclusion of the 20 consecutive Interest Payment Periods. If the Company fails to pay in full all accrued and unpaid interest at the conclusion of the 20 consecutive Interest Payment Periods, and such failure continues for 30 days, an Event of Default that gives rise to acceleration of principal and interest on the Notes will occur under this Indenture. (f) During an Optional Deferral Period, interest will continue to accrue on the Notes of the applicable series, and deferred Interest Payments will accrue additional interest on a semi-annual basis at a rate equal to the interest rate then-applicable to such series of Notes (including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any Compound Interest). No interest will be due and payable on the Notes until the end of the Optional Deferral Period except upon a redemption of the Notes during the Optional Deferral Period. The Interest Payment Date falling immediately after the last day of an Optional Deferral Period shall not be deemed to fall on a day during such Optional Deferral Period. 

19 (g) No interest will be due or payable on the Notes of a given series during any Optional Deferral Period, except upon a redemption pursuant to Section 2.06 of any Notes of such series on any redemption date during such optional deferral period (in which case all accrued and unpaid interest (including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any Compound Interest) on the Notes of such series to be redeemed to, but excluding, such redemption date will be due and payable on such redemption date), or unless the principal of and interest on the Notes of such series shall have been declared due and payable as the result of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes of such series (in which case all accrued and unpaid interest, including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any Compound Interest, on the Notes shall become due and payable). (h) During an Optional Deferral Period, the Company will not, and will cause its majority-owned subsidiaries, as applicable, not to: (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on any shares of the Company s Capital Stock; (ii) redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to any shares of the Company s Capital Stock; (iii) make any payment of principal of, or interest (to the extent such interest is deferrable) or premium, if any, on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any of the Company s Indebtedness ranking on a parity with, or ranking junior to, the Notes in right of payment (including debt securities of other series, such as the other series of Notes hereunder); or (iv) make any payments with respect to any guarantees by the Company of any Indebtedness if such Guarantees rank on a parity with or junior to the Notes in right of payment. (i) However, the foregoing provisions of Section 4.01(h) shall not prevent or restrict the Company from making: (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of the Company s Capital Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors, agents or consultants or a stock purchase, dividend reinvestment or similar plan, or the satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred requiring it to purchase, redeem or acquire the Company s Capital Stock; (ii) any payment, repayment, redemption, purchase, acquisition or declaration of a dividend described in clause (h)(i) above as a result of a reclassification of the Company s Capital Stock, or the exchange or conversion of all or a portion of one class or series of the Company s Capital Stock for another class or series of the Company s Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company s Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of the Company s Capital Stock 

20 or the security being converted or exchanged, or in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred; (iv) declaration or making of dividends, payments or distributions payable in the Company s Capital Stock (or rights to acquire the Company s Capital Stock), or purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of the Company s Capital Stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of the Company s Capital Stock (or of securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company s Capital Stock) and distributions in connection with the settlement of stock purchase contracts outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred; (v) redemptions, exchanges, acquisitions or repurchases of, or with respect to, (A) any rights outstanding under any employment contract, incentive plan, benefit plan or similar arrangement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (B) in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stock purchase plan, in each case outstanding on the date that the payment of interest is deferred or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future; (vi) implementation of a shareholders rights plan, or issuance of rights, stock or other property under such plan, or redemption, repurchase of otherwise acquisition of any such rights pursuant thereto; or (vii) settling conversions of any convertible notes that rank equally with the Notes. (j) In the event that the Company elects to defer any Interest Payment, the Company shall notify the Trustee and the Holders in writing of such election at least one Business Day prior to the Regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on which the Company intends to begin an Optional Deferral Period; provided, however, that the Company s failure to pay the interest owed on a particular Interest Payment Date shall also constitute the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period, unless such interest is paid within five Business Days after such Interest Payment Date, whether or not the Company provides a notice of deferral. (k) In the event that the Company elects to defer any Interest Payment, the Company will give DTC, the Holders of the Notes of the applicable series and the Trustee written notice of its election of, or any shortening or extension of, an Optional Deferral Period at least 15 Business Days prior to the earlier of (1) each next succeeding Interest Payment Date or (2) the date upon which the Company is required to give notice to any applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of the Notes of the applicable series of the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the regular record date therefor. The record date for the payment of deferred interest and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any compound interest payable on the Interest Payment Date immediately following the last day of an optional deferral period will be the regular record date with respect to such Interest Payment Date.

ISIN NO: US15189TBH95 CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the state of Texas (herein referred to as the Company, which term includes any successor person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to the Registered Holder named above, the principal sum specified in the Schedule of Increases or Decreases in this Note annexed hereto on February 15, 2055 (the Series A Maturity Date ), and to pay (subject to deferral as set forth herein) interest thereon (i) from and including the date of the original issuance to, but excluding, February 15, 2030 at an annual rate of 7.000 and (ii) from and including February 15, 2030 during each Series A Interest Reset Period at an annual rate equal to the Five-Year Treasury Rate as of the most recent Reset Interest Determination Date, plus 3.254 . Subject to the Company s right to defer interest payments as set forth in the Supplemental Indenture (as defined on the reverse hereof), interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on February 15, 2025 (the Interest Payment Dates ), until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. If interest payments are deferred or otherwise not paid, they will accrue and compound until paid at the same rate at which the Notes (as defined on the reverse hereof) bear interest to the extent permitted by law. As permitted by the terms of the Notes, if interest payments are deferred or otherwise not paid up to a redemption date that does not fall on an Interest Payment Date, they will accrue and compound until paid at the same rate at which the Notes bear interest to the extent permitted by law. The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and with respect to any period less than a full calendar month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during the period. The interest so payable on an Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered, at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided that interest payable at Series A Maturity Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for, and that is not deferred as described below, will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid (i) to the Person in whose name this Note (or any Note issued upon registration of transfer or exchange thereof) is registered at the close of business on the record date for the payment of such defaulted interest established in accordance with Section 3.07 of the Base Indenture or (ii) at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of the securities exchange, if any, on which the Note may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange. The Regular Record Date with respect to any Interest Payment Date for the Notes, will be the close of business on 

February 1 or August 1 (whether or not such day is a Business Day) immediately preceding the applicable February 15 or August 15 Interest Payment Date. If an Interest Payment Date or the Series A Maturity Date of the Notes or the date (if any) on which the Company is required to purchase the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest shall accrue or be paid in respect of such delay. This Note may be presented for payment of principal and interest at the office of the Paying Agent, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; provided, however, that at the option of the Company, interest on this Note may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto, as the address shall appear on the Security Register, or by a wire transfer to an account designated by the Person entitled thereto. Payment of the principal and interest on this Note shall be made in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

If the Five-Year Treasury Rate cannot be determined pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Calculation Agent, after consulting such sources as it deems comparable to any of the foregoing calculations, or any such source as it deems reasonable from which to estimate the Five-Year Treasury Rate, will determine the Five- Year Treasury Rate in its sole discretion, provided that if the Calculation Agent determines there is an industry-accepted successor Five-Year Treasury Rate, then the Calculation Agent will use such successor rate. If the Calculation Agent has determined a substitute or successor base rate in accordance with the foregoing, the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion may determine the business day convention, the definition of Business Day and the Reset Interest Determination Date to be used and any other relevant methodology for calculating such substitute or successor base rate, including any adjustment factor needed to make such substitute or successor base rate comparable to the Five-Year Treasury Rate, in a manner that is consistent with industry-accepted practices for such substitute or successor base rate. H.15 means the daily statistical release designated as such, or any successor publication as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion, published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Interest Payment Period means the semi-annual period from, and including, an Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, except for the first Interest Payment Date, which shall be the period from, and including, August 14, 2024 to, but excluding, February 15, 2025. 

Series A Reset Date means February 15, 2030 and each date falling on the five-year anniversary of the preceding Series A Reset Date. Series A Interest Reset Period means the period from and including February 15, 2030 to, but not including, the next following Series A Reset Date and thereafter each period from and including each Series A Reset Date to, but not including, the next following Series A Reset Date or the maturity date or date of redemption, as the case may be. Most Recent H.15 means the H.15 published closest in time but prior to the close of business on the applicable Reset Interest Determination Date. Reset Interest Determination Date means, in respect of any Series A Interest Reset Period, the day falling two Business Days prior to the beginning of such Series A Interest Reset Period. So long as no Event of Default with respect to the Notes of this series has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right on one or more occasions, to defer payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest otherwise due on this Security by extending the interest payment period for up to twenty (20) consecutive Interest Payment Periods (each period, commencing on the date that the first such interest payment would otherwise have been made, an Optional Deferral Period ). The Company may not elect to defer payment of interest if an Event of Default (as set forth in the Supplemental Indenture) with respect to the Notes has occurred and is continuing; provided that the deferral of interest payments may not extend beyond the Series A Maturity Date or end on a day other than the day immediately preceding an Interest Payment Date. As provided in the Indenture, interest will continue to accrue on the Notes, and deferred interest payments will accrue additional interest on a semi-annual basis at a rate equal to the interest rate then-applicable to the Notes, including, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the deferred interest Compound Interest ). No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period, except at the end of such Optional Deferral Period or upon a redemption of this Note during such Optional Deferral Period. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, prior to the termination of any Optional Deferral Period, the Company may further defer the payment of interest by extending such Optional Deferral Period; provided that such Optional Deferral Period together with all such previous and further deferrals of interest payments shall not exceed twenty (20) consecutive Interest Payment Periods at any one time or extend beyond the Series A Maturity Date. Upon the termination of any Optional Deferral Period, which shall be an Interest Payment Date, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid on this Note, including any Compound Interest, to the Person in whose name this Note is registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest accrued and unpaid on this Security, including any Compound Interest, payable at Series A Maturity Date or on any Tax Event Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Once the Company pays all interest accrued and unpaid on this Note, including any Compound Interest, it shall be entitled again to defer interest payments on this Note as described above.

In addition, the Series A Notes may be redeemable, in whole but not in part, at the option of the Company, by a notice of redemption delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to the Indenture (except as otherwise set forth below), following the occurrence of a Tax Event (as defined below), at a redemption price equal to the sum of: (1) 100 of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus (2) accrued and unpaid interest (including any Compound Interest) thereon, if any, to such Tax Event Redemption Date. Tax Event means receipt by the Company of a written opinion of a nationally recognized accounting firm or counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of: (a) any amendment to, clarification of, or change, including any announced prospective change, in the laws or treaties of the United States or any of its political subdivisions or taxing authorities, or any regulations under those laws or treaties; (b) an administrative action, which means any judicial decision or any official administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure, notice or announcement including any notice or announcement of intent to issue or adopt any administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure or regulation; (c) any amendment to, clarification of, or change in the official position or the interpretation of any administrative action or judicial decision or any interpretation or pronouncement that provides for a position with respect to an administrative action or judicial decision that differs from the previously generally accepted position, in each case by any legislative body, court, governmental authority or regulatory body, regardless of the time or manner in which that amendment, clarification or change is introduced or made known; or (d) a threatened challenge asserted in writing in connection with an audit of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or a publicly-known threatened challenge asserted in writing against any other taxpayer that has raised capital through the issuance of securities that are substantially similar to the Notes of this series, which amendment, clarification or change is effective or administrative action is taken or judicial decision, interpretation or pronouncement is issued or threatened challenge is asserted or becomes publicly known after August 12, 2024, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest payable by the Company on the Securities of this series is not deductible, or within 90 days would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company for United States federal income tax purposes. 

In addition, the Notes of this series may be redeemable, in whole but not in part, at the option of the Company, by a notice of redemption delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to the Indenture (except as otherwise set forth in the immediately succeeding paragraph), following the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event (as defined below), at a redemption price equal to 102 of the principal amount of such Securities of this series being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest (including any Compound Interest) to, but excluding, such Tax Event Redemption Date. Rating Agency Event means, as of any date, a change, clarification or amendment in the methodology in assigning equity credit to securities such as the Notes published by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act (or any successor provision thereto) that then publishes a rating for the Company (together with any successor thereto, a Rating Agency ), (i) as such methodology was in effect on August 12, 2024, in the case of any Rating Agency that published a rating for the Company on August 12, 2024, or (ii) as such methodology was in effect on the date such Rating Agency first published a rating for the Company, in the case of any Rating Agency that first publishes a rating for the Company on August 12, 2024 (in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), the Current Methodology ), that results in (a) any shortening of the length of time for which a particular level of equity credit pertaining to the Notes by such Rating Agency would have been in effect had the Current Methodology not been changed, clarified or amended or (b) a lower equity credit (including up to a lesser amount) being assigned by such Rating Agency to the Notes as of the date of such change, clarification or amendment than the equity credit that would have been assigned to the Notes by such Rating Agency had the Current Methodology not been changed, clarified or amended. The indebtedness of the Company evidenced by this Note, including the principal hereof and interest hereon, is, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Company s obligations to Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and each Holder of this Note, by acceptance hereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture and all other provisions of the Indenture. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

If interest payments are deferred or otherwise not paid, they will accrue and compound until paid at the same rate at which the Notes (as defined on the reverse hereof) bear interest to the extent permitted by law. As permitted by the terms of the Notes, if interest payments are deferred or otherwise not paid up to a redemption date that does not fall on an Interest Payment Date, they will accrue and compound until paid at the same rate at which the Notes bear interest to the extent permitted by law.

The Regular Record Date with respect to any Interest Payment Date for the Notes, will be the close of business on 

February 1 or August 1 (whether or not such day is a Business Day) immediately preceding the applicable February 15 or August 15 Interest Payment Date. If an Interest Payment Date or the Series B Maturity Date of the Notes or the date (if any) on which the Company is required to purchase the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest shall accrue or be paid in respect of such delay.

If the Calculation Agent has determined a substitute or successor base rate in accordance with the foregoing, the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion may determine the business day convention, the definition of Business Day and the Reset Interest Determination Date to be used and any other relevant methodology for calculating such substitute or successor base rate, including any adjustment factor needed to make such substitute or successor base rate comparable to the Five-Year Treasury Rate, in a manner that is consistent with industry-accepted practices for such substitute or successor base rate. H.15 means the daily statistical release designated as such, or any successor publication as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion, published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Interest Payment Period means the semi-annual period from, and including, an Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, except for the first Interest Payment Date, which shall be the period from, and including, August 14, 2024 to, but excluding, February 15, 2025.

The Company may not elect to defer payments of interest if an Event of Default (as set forth in the Supplemental Indenture) with respect to the Notes has occurred and is continuing; provided that the deferral of interest payments may not extend beyond the Series B Maturity Date or end on a day other than the day immediately preceding an Interest Payment Date. As provided in the Indenture, interest will continue to accrue on the Notes, and deferred interest payments will accrue additional interest on a semi-annual basis at a rate equal to the interest rate then-applicable to the Notes, including, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the deferred interest Compound Interest ). No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period, except at the end of such Optional Deferral Period or upon a redemption of this Note during such Optional Deferral Period.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of Notes shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of the Indenture to institute any suit, 

action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof, as provided in the Indenture, and unless also the Holders of not less than 33 in aggregate principal amount of all the Securities at the time outstanding (considered as one class) shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee under the Indenture and shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee, for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.12 of the Base Indenture; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and Holder of every Note with every other taker and Holder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of Notes shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the Holders of any other of such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder, or to enforce any right under the Indenture, except in the manner therein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Holders of Securities. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of Section 3.05 of the Supplemental Indenture, each and every Holder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity. Nothing contained in the Indenture is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company and the Holders of the Notes, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to such Holders the principal of and interest on such Notes when, where and as the same shall become due and payable, all in accordance with the terms of the Notes, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of such Holders and creditors of the Company other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Company, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under Article VII of the Supplemental Indenture of the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company in respect of cash, property, or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the offices maintained by the Company or its agent for such purpose, duly endorsed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, but without payment of any charge other than a sum sufficient to reimburse the Company for any tax or other governmental charge incident thereto. Upon any such registration of transfer, a new Note or Notes of authorized denomination or denominations for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor. 

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. The Company agrees, and by acceptance of this Note or a beneficial interest in this Note, each Holder hereof and any Person acquiring a beneficial interest herein agrees, to treat this Note as indebtedness for United States federal, state and local tax purposes.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor person, either directly or through the Company, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as a part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.
