, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Inland Bancorp, Inc. ("Inland") and its subsidiaries pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 30, 2022 (the "Merger Agreement"). Inland was merged with and into Byline. As a result of the merger, Inland s wholly owned subsidiary bank, Inland Bank and Trust, was merged with and into Byline Bank, with Byline Bank as the surviving bank. The acquisition improves the Company s footprint in the Chicagoland market, diversifies its commercial banking business, and strengthens the core deposit base. In a related but separate transaction, on March 31, 2023, Byline entered into a side letter agreement with the majority shareholder of Inland in which Byline agreed to purchase shares of Inland common stock. The purchase price was calculated based on the terms of the Merger Agreement. The transaction was completed on , which resulted in the payment of cash in the amount of million. At the effective time of the merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of Inland s common stock was converted into the right to receive: (1) shares of Byline s common stock, par value per share, and (2) a cash payment in the amount of per share, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares. The per share cash consideration was based on the total million divided by the outstanding shares of Inland common stock. Based on the closing price of shares of the Company s common stock of , as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, and shares of common stock issued with respect to the outstanding shares of Inland common stock, the stock consideration was valued at million. Options to acquire shares of Inland common stock that were outstanding at the Effective Time were canceled, at the option holders' election, in exchange for a cash payment in accordance with the Merger Agreement of , to be paid after the closing date. In addition, the shares of Inland common stock purchased on June 30, 2023 were canceled as of the effective time of the transaction. The value of the total merger consideration at closing was million. Stock issuance costs were . The transaction resulted in goodwill of million, which is nondeductible for tax purposes, as this acquisition was a nontaxable transaction. Goodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and reflects related synergies expected from the combined operations. Inland merger-related expenses, including salaries and employee benefits of million, core system conversion expenses of million, acquisition advisory expenses of million, and other non-interest expenses of related to the Inland acquisition are reflected in non-interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Inland merger-related expenses including core system conversion expenses of million, acquisition advisory expenses of million, salaries and employee benefits of million, and other non-interest expenses of related to the Inland acquisition are reflected in non-interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were Inland merger-related expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The acquisition of Inland was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805. Assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration exchanged were recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities involves significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions

Certain securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. The Company evaluated the securities which had unrealized losses for potential credit losses and determined there were none. There were securities available-for-sale with unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 . There was security held-to-maturity with unrealized losses at September 30, 2024. There was no allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity debt securities at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The evaluation for potential credit losses is based upon factors such as the creditworthiness of the issuers/guarantors, the underlying collateral, if applicable, and the continuing payment performance of the securities. Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security types. The Company s held-to-maturity portfolio contains municipal bonds that are typically rated by major rating agencies as Aa or better. The Company uses industry historical credit loss information adjusted for current conditions to establish an allowance for credit losses. Accrued interest receivable on securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The Company anticipates full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities by maturity. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. There were no proceeds from sales of securities available-for-sale, nor associated gains and losses on sales and calls of securities, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Securities posted and pledged as collateral were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , of those pledged, the carrying amounts of securities pledged as collateral for public fund deposits were million and million, respectively, and for customer repurchase agreements of million and million, respectively. There were securities pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were securities pledged for advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Other securities were pledged for letters of credit and for purposes required or permitted by law.

The Company hedges interest rates on certain loans using interest rate swaps through which the Company pays variable amounts and receives fixed amounts.

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans and leases considered for inclusion in the allowance for credit losses include acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases, purchased credit deteriorated loans, and originated loans and leases. The Bank s credit risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings from 1 to 10, where a higher rating represents higher risk. Risk ratings for all loans of million or more are reviewed annually. The risk rating categories are described by the following groupings: Pass 1 4, risk levels of borrowers and guarantors that offer a minimal to an acceptable level of risk. Watch 5, credit exposure that presents higher than average risk and warrants greater than routine attention. Special Mention 6, potential weaknesses that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects. Substandard Accrual 7, weaknesses in cash flow and collateral coverage resulting in a distinct possibility of losses if not corrected. Used in limited cases, where the borrower is current on payments and an agreed plan for credit remediation. Substandard Non Accrual 8, well defined weakness or weaknesses in cash flow and collateral coverage resulting in the distinct possibility of losses if not corrected. Doubtful 9, weaknesses inherent in substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loss 10, is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a realizable asset is not warranted. Revolving loans that are converted to term loans are treated as new originations and are presented by year of origination. Generally, existing term loans that are re-underwritten are reflected in the table in the year of renewal.

Loan servicing asset revaluation, which represents the changes in fair value of servicing assets, resulted in a downward valuation adjustment of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Loan servicing asset revaluation resulted in a downward valuation adjustment of million and million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value of servicing rights is highly sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. Changes in secondary market premiums and prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of servicing rights. Generally, as interest rates rise on variable rate loans, loan prepayments increase due to an increase in refinance activity, which may result in a decrease in the fair value of servicing assets. Measurement of fair value is limited to the conditions existing and the assumptions used as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may change over time. Refer to Note 15 Fair Value Measurement for further details.

The Company includes lease extension and termination options in the lease term if, after considering relevant economic factors, it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, the Company has elected to account for any non-lease components in its real estate leases as part of the associated lease component. The Company has also elected not to recognize leases with original lease terms of 12 months or less ("short-term leases") on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Leases are classified at the lease commencement date. Lease expense for operating leases and short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is

The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value for certain assets measured and carried at fair value on a n-recurring basis: Individually evaluated loans The Company individually evaluates loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, including non-accrual loans. Specific allowance for credit losses is measured based on a discounted cash flow of ongoing operations, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or a calculation of the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs. Valuations of individually assessed loans that are collateral dependent are supported by third party appraisals in accordance with the Bank's credit policy. Accordingly, individually evaluated loans are classified as Level 3. Assets held for sale Assets held for sale consist of former branch locations and real estate previously purchased for expansion. Assets are considered held for sale when management has approved to sell the assets following a branch closure or other events. The properties are being actively marketed and transferred to assets held for sale based on the lower of carrying value or its fair value, less estimated costs to sell. The Company records assets held for sale on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition within accrued interest receivable and other assets. Other real estate owned Certain assets held within other real estate owned represent real estate or other collateral that has been adjusted to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell, as a result of transferring from the loan portfolio at the time of foreclosure or repossession and based on management s periodic impairment evaluation. From time to time, non-recurring fair value adjustments to other real estate owned are recorded to reflect partial write-downs based on an observable market price or current appraised value of property.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of other assets and liabilities for disclosure purposes: Cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits with other banks For these short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Securities held-to-maturity The Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. Management reviews the procedures used by the third party, including significant inputs used in the fair value calculations. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond s terms and conditions, among other things. When market quotes are not readily accessible or available, alternative approaches are utilized, such as matrix or model pricing. Restricted stock The fair value has been determined to approximate cost. Loans held for sale The fair value of loans held for sale are based on quoted market prices, where available, and determined by discounted estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Company s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. Loan and lease receivables, net For certain variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant changes in credit risk, fair value is estimated at carrying value. The fair value of other types of loans is estimated using an exit price notion. It is estimated by discounting future cash flows, using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting future cash flows, using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Federal Home Loan Bank advances The fair value of FHLB advances is estimated by discounting the agreements based on maturities using rates currently offered for FHLB advances of similar remaining maturities adjusted for prepayment penalties that would be incurred if the borrowings were paid off on the measurement date. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase The carrying amount approximates fair value due to maturities of less than ninety days. Term Loan The carrying amount approximates fair value given the variable interest rate and repricing of interest. Line of credit The carrying amount approximates fair value given the variable interest rate and repricing of interest. Subordinated notes The fair value is based on available market prices.

As of the effective time of the transaction reported in Note 3 Acquisition of a Business, Byline acquired and assumed two types of derivative instruments. Interest rate swap agreements previously designated as cash flow hedges of certain junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts had notional amounts of million and had a fair value of million included in accrued interest receivable and other assets. In July 2023, the Company terminated the interest rate swap agreements that resulted in a net gain of . Other interest rate swap agreements not designated as hedging instruments had notional amounts of million and fair values of million reported in accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued interest payable and other liabilities. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges Cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with certain financial instruments had notional amounts totaling million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value of the derivatives hedging instrument with the fair value of the designated hedged transactions. As of September 30, 2024 , the cash flow hedges aggregating million in notional amounts are comprised of million pay-fixed interest rate swaps associated with certain deposits and other borrowings, and million receive-fixed interest rate swaps associated with certain variable rate loans. As of September 30, 2024, pay-fixed interest rate swaps are comprised of six effective hedges, and the receive-fixed interest rate swaps are comprised of four effective hedges. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the unrealized gain or loss on the derivatives is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into interest income or expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest in come or expense as interest payments are made on the hedged instruments. Interest recorded on these swap transactions included million of interest income recorded for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , and is reported as a component of interest expense on deposits and other borrowings. Interest recorded on these swap transactions included million and million of interest income recorded during nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is reported as a component of interest expense on deposits and other borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimate s millio n of the net unrealized gain to be reclassified as a net decrease to interest expense during the next twelve months. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) also includes the amortization of the remaining balance related to terminated interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, which are over the original life of the cash flow hedge. In March 2023, the Company terminated interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges totaling million, of which million became effective in May 2023 and million became effective in June 2023. The transaction resulted in a gain of million, net of tax, which was the clean value at termination date and began amortizing as a decrease to interest expense

As of September 30, 2024 , the weighted average pay rates of the receive-fixed interest rate swaps of million were and the weighted average receive rates were . 

Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company s exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements and/or the Company has not elected to apply hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings. Other interest rate derivatives The total combined notional amount was million as of September 30, 2024 with maturities ranging from to . The fair values of the interest rate derivative agreements are reflected in other assets and other liabilities with corresponding gains or losses reflected in non-interest income. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were and of net transaction fees, included in other non-interest income, related to these derivative instruments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were and of net transaction fees, included in other non-interest income, related to these derivative instruments. These instruments are inherently subject to market risk and credit risk. Market risk is associated with changes in interest rates and credit risk relates to the Company s risk of loss when the counterparty to a derivative contract fails to perform according to the terms of the agreement. Market and credit risks are managed and monitored as part of the Company s overall asset-liability management process. The credit risk related to derivatives entered into with certain qualified borrowers is managed through the Company s loan underwriting process. The Company s loan underwriting process also approves the Bank s swap counterparty used to mirror the borrowers swap. The Company has a bilateral agreement with each swap counterparty that provides that fluctuations in derivative values are to be fully collateralized with either cash or securities.

Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with certain customer foreign currency transactions.

The fair values of the credit derivatives is reflected in accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued interest payable and other liabilities with corresponding gains or losses reflected in non-interest income or other comprehensive income. The Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a cross-default provision under which if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The Company also has agreements with certain derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well or adequately capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations resulted in a net asset position.

 The following is a discussion and analysis of Byline Bancorp, Inc. s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The words the Company, we, Byline, management, our and us refer to Byline Bancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless we indicate otherwise. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors . Byline assumes no obligation to update any of these forward looking statements. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Statements contained in this report and in other documents we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC that are not historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, predictions, forecasts, objectives or assumptions of future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, expects, can, could, may, predicts, potential, opportunity, should, will, estimate, plans, projects, continuing, ongoing, expects, seeks, intends and similar words or phrases. Accordingly, these statements involve estimates, known and unknown risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual strategies, actions or results to differ materially from those expressed in such statements, and are not guarantees of future results or other events or performance. Because forward-looking statements are necessarily only estimates of future strategies, actions or results, based on management s current expectations, assumptions and estimates on the date hereof, and there can be no assurance that actual strategies, actions or results will not differ materially from expectations, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. 
 Our ability to predict results or the actual effects of future plans, strategies or events is inherently uncertain. Factors which could cause actual results or conditions to differ materially from those reflected in forward-looking statements include: 
 uncertainty regarding domestic, foreign, and geopolitical developments and the United States and global economic outlook that may impact market conditions or affect demand for certain banking products and services, and the impact on our customers, which could impair the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans and leases, impair collateral values and further increase our allowance for credit losses - loans and leases, as well as result in possible asset impairment charges; 

unforeseen credit quality problems or changing economic conditions that could result in charge-offs greater than we have anticipated in our allowance for credit losses - loans and leases or changes in the value of our investments; 

commercial real estate market conditions in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin; 

deterioration in the financial condition of our borrowers resulting in significant increases in our loan and lease losses and provisions for those losses and other related adverse impacts to our results of operations and financial condition; 

fair value estimates of certain of our assets and liabilities, which could change in value significantly from period to period; 

competitive pressures in the financial services industry in our market areas relating to both pricing and loan and lease structures, which may impact our growth rate; 

demand for loan products and deposit flows; 

unanticipated developments in pending or prospective loan and/or lease transactions or greater-than-expected paydowns or payoffs of existing loans and leases; 

inaccurate information and assumptions in our analytical and forecasting models used to manage our balance sheet; 

unanticipated changes in monetary policies of the Federal Reserve or significant adjustments in the pace of, or market expectations for, future interest rate changes; 

availability of sufficient and cost-effective sources of liquidity, funding, and capital as and when needed; 

our ability to attract, retain or the loss of key personnel or an inability to recruit appropriate talent cost-effectively; 

adverse effects on our information technology systems resulting from failures, human error or cyberattack, including the potential impact of disruptions or security breaches at our third-party service providers, any of which could result in an information or security breach, the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, significant legal and financial losses and reputational harm; 

greater-than-anticipated costs to support the growth of our business, including investments in new lines of business, products and services, or technology, process improvements or other infrastructure enhancements, or greater-than-anticipated compliance or regulatory costs and burdens; 

the impact of possible future acquisitions, if any, including the costs and burdens of integration efforts; 

47 

the ability of the Company to receive dividends from Byline Bank; 

legislative or regulatory changes, particularly changes in regulation of financial services companies and/or the products and services offered by financial services companies; 

changes in Small Business Administration ("SBA") and U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") U.S. government guaranteed lending rules, regulations, loan and lease products and funding limits, including specifically the SBA Section 7(a) program, as well as changes in SBA or USDA standard operating procedures or changes to the status of Byline Bank as an SBA Preferred Lender; 

changes in accounting principles, policies and guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banking generally; 

the impact of a possible change in the federal or state income tax rates on our deferred tax assets and provision for income tax expense;

the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; 

the risk that the integration of acquisition operations will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected; 

the effect of mergers on customer relationships and operating results; and 

other risks detailed from time to time in filings we make with the SEC. 

These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. You should also consider the risks, assumptions and uncertainties set forth in the Risk Factors section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that was filed with the SEC on March 4, 2024, as well as those set forth in the reports we file with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update any of these statements in light of new information, future events or otherwise unless required under the federal securities laws.

Overview 
 Our Business 
 We are a bank holding company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, and conduct all our business activities through our subsidiary, Byline Bank, a full service commercial bank, and Byline Bank s subsidiaries. Through Byline Bank, we offer a broad range of banking products and services to small and medium sized businesses, commercial real estate and financial sponsors and to consumers who generally live or work near our branches. We also offer online account opening to consumer and business customers through our website and provide trust and wealth management services to our customers. In addition to our traditional commercial banking business, we provide small ticket equipment leasing solutions through Byline Financial Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Byline Bank, headquartered in Bannockburn, Illinois, with sales offices in Illinois, and sales representatives in Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York. We participate in U.S. government guaranteed lending programs and originate U.S. government guaranteed loans. Byline Bank is a leading originator of SBA loans and was the most active 7(a) and 504 lender in Illinois for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of interest income on loans and lease receivables, including accretion income on loans, investment securities and other short-term investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. Our results of operations are also dependent upon our generation of non-interest income, consisting primarily of income from fees and service charges on deposits, loan servicing revenue, wealth management and trust income, ATM and interchange fees, and net gains on sales of investment securities and loans. Other factors contributing to our results of operations include our provision for credit losses, provision for income taxes, and non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and other miscellaneous operating costs. 
 We reported consolidated net income of 30.3 million, or 0.70 per basic and 0.69 diluted common share, and 90.4 million or 2.08 per basic and 2.07 per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 28.2 million, or 0.66 per basic and 0.65 per diluted common share, and 78.3 million or 2.01 per basic and 1.98 per diluted share and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.1 million and 12.2 million, respectively. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, the increase in net income was attributable to a 3.6 million decrease in non-interest expense, and a 2.0 million increase in non-interest income, offset by a 5.0 million decrease in net interest income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, the increase to net income was primarily attributable to a 15.2 million increase in net interest income and a 4.3 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, offset by a 5.3 million increase in non-interest expenses and a 2.8 million increase to the provision for income taxes. 
 Dividends declared on common shares were 4.0 million and 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Dividends paid on common shares were 3.9 million and 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Dividends declared on common shares were 11.9 million and 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Dividends paid on common shares were 11.9 million and 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 yielded an annualized return on average assets of 1.29 and 1.30 and an annualized return on average stockholders equity of 11.39 and 12.11 , respectively. Our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 yielded an annualized return on average assets of 1.32 and 1.34 and an annualized return on average stockholders equity of 11.81 and 12.48 , respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had consolidated total assets of 9.4 billion, total gross loans and leases outstanding of 6.9 billion, total deposits of 7.5 billion, and total stockholders equity of 1.1 billion. 
 Inland Bancorp, Inc. Acquisition 
 On July 1, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Inland Bancorp, Inc., ("Inland") under the terms of a definitive merger agreement. As a result of the merger, Inland's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Inland Bank and Trust, was merged with and into Byline Bank. Refer to Note 3 Acquisition of a Business of our Unaudited Interim Condensed Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024, which is included in this report, for additional information. 
 First Security Bancorp, Inc. Acquisition 
 On September 30, 2024, we announced the execution of an Agreement and Plan of Merger in connection with a proposed acquisition of First Security Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("First Security Bancorp"), a nd First Security Bancorp's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, First Security Trust and Savings Bank First Security ), an Illinois chartered bank. As of June 30, 2024, First Security Bancorp reported 354.8 million in assets, 201.4 million of loans, and 321.8 million of deposits. The consideration to be paid by the Company will consist of shares of Byline common stock (currently estimated at approximately 1.5 million shares), subject to adjustments as set forth in the merger agreement. Outstanding First Security Bancorp preferred shares will be redeemed in cash at closing with an estimated aggregated value of approximately 2.6 million. Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, the approval of First Security Bancorp's stockholders, and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions. We expect the acquisition to close in the first half of 2025.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates 
 Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and to general practices within the banking industry. To prepare financial statements and interim financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, which are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements. 
 These critical accounting policies and estimates include (i) determination of the allowance for credit losses, (ii) the valuation of intangible assets such as goodwill, and assessment of impairment, (iii) fair value estimations, and (iv) the determination and assessment of impairment for other intangible assets. 
 The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that require us to make complex and subjective judgments. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that we filed with the SEC on March 4, 2024. 
 Allowance for credit losses 
 The allowance for credit losses ("ACL") represents management s estimate of current expected credit losses over the life of a financial asset carried at amortized cost at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of collectively and individually evaluated loss reserves. 
 The ACL is maintained at a level that management believes is appropriate to provide for current expected credit losses as of the dates of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and we have established methodologies for the determination of its adequacy. The methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. We increase our ACL by recording provisions for credit losses against our income and decrease by charge offs, net of recoveries. 
 The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and leases, changes in economic or other conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods. 
 For each portfolio, management estimates expected credit losses over the life of each loan and lease utilizing lifetime or cumulative loss rate methodology. The lifetime loss rates are estimated by analyzing a combination of internal and external data related to historical performance of each loan and lease pool over a complete economic cycle. Loss rates are based on historical averages for each loan and lease pool, adjusted to reflect the impact of a forward-looking forecast of certain macroeconomic variables, primarily unemployment rates, which management considers to be both reasonable and supportable. Various economic scenarios are considered and weighted to arrive at the forecast that most reflects management s expectation of future conditions. After a one-year forecast period, a one-year reversion period adjusts loss experience to the historical average on a straight-line basis. 
 Management also considers qualitative risk factor adjustments that are intended to capture internal and external trends not reflected in historical loss history. Each risk factor is assigned an allowance level based on management s judgment as to the expected impact of each risk factor on each loan and lease portfolio and is monitored quarterly. All loans and leases of 500,000 or greater with an internal risk rating of substandard or below, or on nonaccrual status are individually evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. 
 The Company also maintains an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures for unfunded loan commitments. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life based on management s consideration of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Management tracks the level and trends in unused commitments and takes into consideration the same factors as those considered for purposes of the allowance for credit losses on outstanding loans. 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our recapitalization and acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but is periodically evaluated for impairment under the provisions of ASC 350. 
 Impairment testing is performed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach at the reporting unit level. Our goodwill is allocated to Byline Bank, which is our only applicable reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. We have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test. Additionally, we perform a goodwill impairment evaluation on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists. 
 Other intangible assets 
 Other intangible assets primarily consist of core deposit intangible assets and customer relationship intangible. In valuing intangible assets, we consider variables such as servicing costs, attrition rates and market discount rates. Intangible assets are reviewed annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of the intangible asset is determined to be less than its carrying value, we would then measure the amount of impairment based on an estimate of the fair value at that time. We also evaluate whether the events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision 
 50 

to the remaining useful lives of intangible assets. In cases where a revision is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful life. Core deposit intangibles are currently amortized over an approximate ten-year period and customer intangibles are amortized over a twelve-year period. 
 Fair value of Financial Instruments 
 ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. 
 See Note 15 of our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024, included in this report, for a complete discussion of our use of fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their related measurement practices. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2 of our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024, which is included in this report, for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the effective dates of adoption and anticipated effects on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business 
 As a financial institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our financial condition. We evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our consolidated financial statements as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance, and the final condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region. Comparison of our financial performance against other financial institutions is impacted by the accounting for acquired non credit-deteriorated and purchased credit deteriorated loans. 
 Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of interest income on loans and lease receivables, including accretion income on loans, investment securities and other short-term investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. Our results of operations are also dependent upon our generation of non-interest income, consisting primarily of income from fees and service charges on deposits, loan servicing revenue, wealth management and trust income, ATM and interchange fees, and net gains on sales of investment securities and loans. Other factors contributing to our results of operations include our provisions for credit losses, provision for income taxes, and non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, and other miscellaneous operating costs.

We reported consolidated net income of 30.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 28.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.1 million. The increase in net income was attributable to a 3.6 million decrease in non-interest expense, and a 2.0 million increase in non-interest income, offset by a 5.0 million decrease in net interest income. Net income was 0.70 per basic and 0.69 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.66 per basic and 0.65 per diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to decreases in data processing expense attributable to the Inland transaction. The increase in non-interest income was mainly due to a decrease in the downward revaluation of the loan servicing asset. The decrease in net interest income was mainly a result of higher rates paid on deposits. 
 Our annualized return on average assets was 1.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.30 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our annualized return on average stockholders equity was 11.39 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.11 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio was 52.02 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 53.75 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We reported consolidated net income of 90.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 78.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 12.2 million. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a 15.2 million increase in net interest income and a decrease of 4.3 million in provision for credit losses, offset by an 5.3 million increase in non-interest expense, and a 2.8 million increase in the provision for income taxes. Net income was 2.08 per basic and 2.07 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.01 per basic and 1.98 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in net interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly a result of increased average balances and higher yields on loans and leases. The increase in non-interest expense was mostly due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits. 
 Our annualized return on average assets was 1.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our annualized return on average stockholders equity was 11.81 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.48 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio was 52.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 52.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income, representing interest income less interest expense, is a significant contributor to our revenues and earnings. We generate interest income from interest and dividends on interest-earning assets, which include loans, leases and investment securities we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which include interest-bearing deposits, subordinated debt, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, junior subordinated debentures and other borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (i) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (iii) our net interest spread, and (iv) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as the annualized net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources. 
 We also recognize income from the accretable discounts associated with the purchase of interest-earning assets. Because of our recapitalization and acquisitions, we derive a portion of our interest income from the accretable discounts on purchase credit deteriorated and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans. The accretion is generally recognized over the life of the loan. This accretion will continue to have an impact on our net interest income as long as loans acquired with a discount at acquisition represent a meaningful portion of our interest-earning assets. As of September 30, 2024, purchased credit deteriorated loans accounted for under ASC Topic 326 represented 2.1 of our total loan and lease portfolio compared to 3.4 at December 31, 2023. 
 Changes in the market interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. In addition, our interest income includes the accretion of the discounts on our acquired loans, which will also affect our net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income.

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the periods shown. Information is provided with respect to (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate) and (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume. Yields have been calculated on a pre-tax basis. The table below is a summary of increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average balances (volume) and changes in average interest rates (dollars in thousands):

Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 87.5 million compared to 92.5 million during the same period in 2023, a decrease of 5.0 million, or 5.4 . Interest income increased 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily a result of growth in the loan and lease portfolio, including acquired loans, and higher yields on interest earning assets. Interest expense increased by 14.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 mostly due growth of the deposit portfolio, including assumed deposits, change in deposit mix, and higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. 
 56 

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 259.5 million compared to 244.3 million during the same period in 2023, an increase of 15.2 million, or 6.2 . Interest income increased 82.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily a result of growth in the loan and lease portfolio. Interest expense increased by 67.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 mostly due growth of the deposit portfolio, including assumed deposits, change in deposit mix, and higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. 
 The net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.88 , a decrease of 58 basis points compared to 4.46 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower loan accretion income and higher rates paid on deposits. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.95 , a decrease of 44 basis points compared to 4.39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher rates paid on deposits. 
 Net loan accretion income was 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 7.3 million mainly due to lower accretion on loans acquired in the Inland acquisition. Total net loan accretion on acquired loans contributed 13 basis points to the net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 50 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net loan accretion income was 10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 694,000 due to lower accretion on loans acquired in the Inland acquisition. Total net loan accretion on acquired loans contributed 17 basis points to the net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Assuming no additional acquisitions, we expect loan accretion income to decline over time. Based on our portfolio, the estimated projected accretion income for the remaining periods as of September 30, 2024 is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

(1) Estimated projected accretion excludes contractual interest income on acquired loans and leases. 
 (2) Projections are undated quarterly, assume no prepayments, and are subject to change. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses reflects the amount required to maintain the ACL at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of collectively and individually evaluated loss reserves. The provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management s evaluation, is appropriate to provide coverage for current expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The ACL is increased by the provision for credit losses and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries on prior charge-offs. 
 The provision for credit losses was 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.3 million and is comprised of a provision for credit losses - loans and leases and a provision for credit losses - unfunded commitments. Provision for credit losses - loans and leases was 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 268,000. On July 1, 2023, a 2.7 million provision for credit losses was recorded on acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans related to the Inland transaction. The provision for credit losses - unfunded commitments was a recapture of 122,000 and a provision of 937,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The provision for credit losses was 20.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4.3 million. Provision for credit losses - loans and leases was 21.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 24.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2.7 million. The provision for credit losses - unfunded commitments reflects a recapture of 1.2 million and a provision of 373,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Fees and service charges on deposits represent amounts charged to customers for banking services, such as fees on deposit accounts, and include, but are not limited to, maintenance fees, insufficient fund fees, overdraft protection fees, wire transfer fees, and other charges. Fees and service charges on deposits were 2.6 million and 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Fees and service charges on deposits were 7.6 million and 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases were primarily due to increases in deposit balances. 
 While portions of the loans that we originate are sold and generate gains on sale revenue, servicing rights for the majority of loans that we sell are retained by us. In exchange for continuing to service loans that have been sold, we receive servicing revenue from a portion of the interest cash flow of the loan. We generated 3.2 million and 3.4 million in loan servicing revenue on the sold portion of the U.S. government guaranteed loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We generated 9.8 million and 10.1 million in loan servicing revenue on the sold portion of the U.S. government guaranteed loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the outstanding balance of guaranteed loans serviced was 1.7 billion. 
 Loan servicing asset revaluation represents net changes in the fair value of our servicing assets. Loan servicing asset revaluation had a downward adjustment of 2.2 million and 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a change of 1.5 million. Change in the quarterly revaluation was mainly due to a decline in the discount rate. Loan servicing asset revaluation had a downward adjustment of 5.4 million and 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a change of 1.5 million. Change in the year-to-date revaluation was mainly due to a decline in overall loans serviced balances and higher prepayment speeds. 
 Net gains on sales of loans were 5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 609,000 or 9.4 , driven mainly by lower volume, offset by higher premiums. We sold 79.5 million of U.S. government guaranteed loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 101.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net gains on sales of loans were 17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 108,000 or 0.6 , driven by average higher premiums received in the current year, offset by a lower volume of loans sold. We sold 225.9 million of U.S. government guaranteed loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 253.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Other non-interest income was 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 330,000 or 16.7 . The increase was primarily driven by increased swap fee income. Other non-interest income was 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.4 million or 27.2 . The increase was primarily driven by net gains on sales of leased equipment, income associated with bank owned life insurance, and increased swap fee income.

This increase was due to lower gains on sales of assets compared to the same period in the prior year. Other non-interest expense was 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.0 million or 6.8 . These increases were mostly due to branch consolidation charges taken during the first half of 2024. 
 Our efficiency ratio was 52.02 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 53.75 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in our efficiency ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by non-interest income growth and decrease in non-interest expense. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 51.62 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 47.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio was 52.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 52.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in our efficiency ratio was due to higher net interest income. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 51.92 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 49.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Income Taxes 
 Our provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 9.7 million compared to 9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 202,000, or 2.0 . The decrease in income tax expense was principally due to a higher discrete income tax benefits due to the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted shares. Our effective tax rate was 24.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 26.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 30.3 million compared to 27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.8 million or 10.3 . The increase in income tax expense was principally due to an increase in net income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate was 25.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 26.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We expect our effective tax rate for 2024 to be approximately 25-27 . 
 Financial Condition 
 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition Analysis 
 Our total assets increased by 542.3 million, or 6.1 , to 9.4 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 8.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 226.5 million, or 100.1 , an increase in securities available for sale of 159.6 million, or 11.9 , and an increase of 195.1 million in loans and leases, or 2.9 , from 6.7 billion at December 31, 2023 to 6.9 billion at September 30, 2024. Our originated loan and lease portfolio increased by 377.0 million and our purchased credit deteriorated loans and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases portfolio decreased by 181.8 million. The increase in our originated portfolio was primarily attributed to growth in the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios. The decrease in our purchased credit deteriorated loans and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases portfolio was attributed to decreases in commercial and residential real estate resulting from resolutions and charge-offs. 
 Total liabilities increased by 436.2 million, or 5.5 , to 8.3 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 7.9 billion at December 31, 2023. Total deposits increased by 320.9 million, or 4.5 , driven by growth in time deposits, interest bearing checking accounts, and money market accounts, offset by decreases to non-interest bearing deposits. Other borrowings increased by 123.6 million, or 31.3 , mainly due to increased FHLB advances. 
 Investment Portfolio 
 Our investment securities portfolio consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. There were no securities classified as trading in our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. All available-for sale securities are carried at fair value and may be used for liquidity purposes should management consider it to be in our best interest. Securities available-for-sale consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agencies securities. 
 Securities available-for-sale increased by 159.6 million, or 11.9 , from 1.3 billion at December 31, 2023 to 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributed to purchases of securities, net of maturities, calls, and repayments coupled with a decrease in unrealized losses as a result of the current interest rate environment. 
 At September 30, 2024, our held-to-maturity securities portfolio consists of obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions. We carry these securities at amortized cost. Securities held-to-maturity were 605,000 at September 30, 2024, and 1.2 million at December 31, 2023, respectively.

Certain securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. At September 30, 2024, we evaluated the securities that had an unrealized loss for credit losses and determined there were none. There were 268 investment securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2024. We anticipate full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities by maturity, or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. 
 The following table (dollars in thousands) set forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our investment securities as of September 30, 2024. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

There were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, with total outstanding balances greater than 10 of our stockholders equity as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Restricted Stock 
 As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, Byline Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB. No market exists for this stock, and it has no quoted market value. The stock is redeemable at par by the FHLB and is, therefore, carried at cost. In addition, Byline Bank owns stock of Bankers Bank that was acquired as part of a bank acquisition. The stock is redeemable at par and carried at cost. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held 22.7 million and 16.3 million, respectively, in FHLB and Bankers Bank stock. We evaluate impairment of our investment in FHLB and Bankers Bank based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. We did not identify any indicators of impairment of FHLB and Bankers Bank stock as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Loan and Lease Portfolio 
 Lending-related income is the most important component of our net interest income and is the main driver of the results of our operations. Total loans and leases at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 6.9 billion and 6.7 billion, respectively, an increase of 195.1 million, or 2.9 . Originated loans and leases were 6.1 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 376.9 million, or 6.5 , compared to 5.8 billion at December 31, 2023. Purchased credit deteriorated loans and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases were 735.5 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 181.8 million, or 19.8 , compared to 917.3 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in our originated portfolio was primarily attributed to organic loan and lease growth, and renewals of acquired loans and leases that are now reflected with originated loans. The decrease in the purchased credit deteriorated and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loan and lease portfolio was driven by renewals of acquired loans and leases as well as resolutions and charge-offs. 
 We strive to maintain a relatively diversified loan portfolio to help reduce the risk inherent in concentration in certain types of collateral. Loans, excluding leases, are typically made to real estate, manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital needs, business expansions and operations. As of September 30, 2024, the loan portfolio included 419.5 million of unguaranteed 7(a) SBA and USDA loans with exposure to the following top three industries: 18.6 retail trade, 13.1 accommodation and food services, and 10.8 manufacturing. The following table shows our allocation of originated, purchase credit deteriorated and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands):

At September 30, 2024, 47.0 of the loan and lease portfolio bears interest at fixed rates and 53.0 at floating rates. The expected life of our loan portfolio will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to curtail or prepay their loans with or without penalties. Because a portion of the portfolio is accounted for under ASC 326, the carrying value is significantly affected by estimates and it is impracticable to allocate scheduled payments for those loans based on those estimates. Consequently, the tables presented include information limited to contractual maturities of the underlying loans.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans and Leases 
 The ACL is determined by us on a quarterly basis, although we are engaged in monitoring the appropriate level of the allowance on a more frequent basis. The ACL reflects management s estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios. The computation includes elements of judgment and high levels of subjectivity. 
 Factors considered by us include, but are not limited to, actual loss experience, peer loss experience, changes in size and risk profile of the portfolio, identification of individual problem loan and lease situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay, application of a reasonable and supportable forecast, and evaluation of the prevailing economic conditions. Changes in conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods. 
 We assess the ACL based on three categories: (i) originated loans and leases, (ii) acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases, and (iii) purchased credit deteriorated loans. 
 Total ACL was 98.9 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 101.7 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 2.8 million or 2.8 . The decrease was primarily due to a decreases associated with individually evaluated loans and decreases in qualitative adjustments. Total ACL to total loans and leases held for investment, net before ACL, was 1.44 and 1.52 of total loans and leases at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 37.5 million of the ACL was allocated to the unguaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) and USDA loans.

Non-Performing Assets 
 Non-performing loans and leases include loans and leases 90 days past due and still accruing and loans and leases accounted for on a non-accrual basis. Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and leases plus other real estate owned. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 71.0 million and 65.3 million, with the decrease driven mainly by decreases to non-accrual loans and leases. The U.S. government guaranteed portion of non-performing loans totaled 11.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 4.2 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Total OREO decreased from 1.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 532,000 at September 30, 2024. The 668,000 decrease in OREO resulted from sales.

Deposits 
 Our loan and lease growth is funded primarily through core deposits. We gather deposits primarily through each of our 45 branch locations in the Chicago metropolitan area and one branch in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Through our branch network, online, mobile and direct banking channels, we offer a variety of deposit products including demand deposit accounts, interest-bearing products, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Small businesses are a significant source of low cost deposits as they value convenience, flexibility, and access to local decision makers that are responsive to their needs. 
 Total deposits at September 30, 2024 were 7.5 billion, representing an increase of 320.9 million, or 4.5 , compared to 7.2 billion at December 31, 2023, driven by an increase in time deposits and money market demand accounts. Non-interest-bearing deposits were 1.7 billion, or 23.1 of total deposits, at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 176.0 million, or 9.2 , compared to 1.9 billion at December 31, 2023, or 26.6 of total deposits. Core deposits were 84.8 and 87.0 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Our average cost of deposits was 2.76 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.13 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our average cost of deposits was 2.65 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were principally attributed to higher rates on interest-bearing deposits as a result of the rising interest rate environment, an increase in interest bearing deposits and corresponding decrease in non-interest bearing deposits related to deposit flows. The ratio of our average non-interest bearing deposits to total average deposits was 23.2 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 28.8 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The ratio of our average non-interest bearing deposits to total average deposits ratios was 24.7 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 32.0 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We had 428.6 million in brokered time deposits at September 30, 2024 and 480.0 million at December 31, 2023, which represented 5.7 and 6.7 of total deposits, respectively. The decrease in brokered deposits was due to increases in other sources of funding. Our loan and lease to deposit ratio was 92.02 at September 30, 2024 compared to 93.39 at December 31, 2023.

 Short Term and Long Term Borrowings 
 In addition to deposits, we also utilize FHLB advances as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations. The Bank s advances from the FHLB are collateralized by commercial, residential and multi-family real estate loans and securities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an available borrowing capacity from the FHLB of 2.9 billion and 2.8 billion, respectively, subject to the availability of collateral. At September 30, 2024, we had 470.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding with a maturities ranging from October 2024 to December 2024. We also had a 13.3 million term loan outstanding maturing in May 2026. 
 On January 17, 2024, we entered into a Letter Agreement with the FRB that allows the Bank to access the BTFP. On January 22, 2024, we opened an advance of 200.0 million from the FRB as part of the BTFP. On September 19, 2024, we repaid the BTFP advance in full. 
 We also have the capacity to borrow funds from the discount window of the Federal Reserve System. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Federal Reserve Bank discount window line as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We pledge loans as collateral for any borrowings under the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.

Customer Repurchase Agreements (Sweeps) 
 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent a demand deposit product offered to customers that sweep balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limit into overnight repurchase agreements. We pledge securities as collateral for the repurchase agreements. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by 5.2 million, from 40.6 million at December 31, 2023 to 35.5 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Liquidity 
 We manage liquidity based upon factors that include the amount of core deposits as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the availability of assets to be readily converted into cash without undue loss, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold and the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the re-pricing characteristics of our liabilities, the ability to securitize and sell certain pools of assets and other factors. 
 Our liquidity needs are primarily met by cash and investment securities positions, growth in deposits, cash flow from amortizing loan portfolios, and borrowings from the FHLB. For additional information regarding our operating, investing, and financing cash flows, see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in our Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Byline Bank had maximum advance potential from the FHLB of 3.4 billion and 781.0 million from the FRB. As of September 30, 2024, Byline Bank had open FHLB advances of 470.0 million and open letters of credit of 13.9 million. Based on collateral, our available aggregate borrowing capacity at September 30, 2024 was 1.3 billion. In addition, Byline Bank had uncommitted federal funds lines available of 127.5 million available at September 30, 2024. 
 As of December 31, 2023, Byline Bank had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of 3.1 billion and 866.5 million from the FRB. As of December 31, 2023, Byline Bank had open FHLB advances of 325.0 million and open letters of credit of 19.7 million. Based on collateral and securities pledged, our available aggregate borrowing capacity at December 31, 2023 was 1.6 billion. In addition, Byline Bank had an uncommitted federal funds line available of 135.0 million available at December 31, 2023. 
 On October 13, 2016, we entered into a 30.0 million revolving credit agreement with a correspondent bank. Through subsequent amendments, the revolving credit agreement was reduced to 15.0 million. The amended revolving line of credit bears interest at either SOFR plus 205 basis points or Prime Rate minus 75 basis points, not to be less than 2.00 , based on our election, which is required to be communicated at least three business days prior to the commencement of an interest period. If we fail to provide timely notification, the interest rate will be Prime Rate minus 75 basis points. On May 24, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Amendment") with the lender, which is effective May 26, 2024, and provides for: (1) the renewal of the revolving line-of-credit facility of up to 15.0 million, and (2) extending its maturity date to May 25, 2025, subject to the existing Negative Pledge Agreement dated October 11, 2018, as amended. 
 At September 30, 2024, the variable term loan had an interest rate of 7.5 and an outstanding balance of 13.3 million. At December 31, 2023, the variable term loan had an interest rate of 7.64 and an outstanding balance of 18.3 million. At September 30, 2024, the line of credit had a no outstanding balance. At December 31, 2023, the line of credit had a 11.3 million outstanding balance and an interest rate of 7.39 
 There are regulatory limitations that affect the ability of Byline Bank to pay dividends to the Company. See Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. 
 We expect that our cash and liquidity resources will be generated by the operations of Byline Bank, which we expect to be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 Capital Resources 
 Stockholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 1.1 billion compared to 990.2 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 106.2 million, or 10.7 . The increase was primarily driven by an increase in retained earnings and a decrease of in accumulated other comprehensive loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to a decrease in the unrealized losses in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, which was a 100.2 million unrealized loss at September 30, 2024, compared to a 130.2 million unrealized loss as of December 31, 2023. 
 The Company and Byline Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. 
 Under applicable bank regulatory capital requirements, each of the Company and Byline Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Byline Bank must also meet certain specific capital guidelines under the prompt corrective action framework. The capital amounts and classification are subject to qualitative judgments by the federal banking regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Byline Bank to maintain minimum 
 73 

amounts and ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets, (referred to as the leverage ratio ), as defined under these capital requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Byline Bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements and was considered well-capitalized . There have been no conditions or events since September 30, 2024 that management believes have changed Byline Bank s classifications. 
 The regulatory capital ratios for the Company and Byline Bank to meet the minimum capital adequacy standards and for Byline Bank to be considered well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework and the Company s and Byline Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios are set forth in the following tables as of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):

The ratios above reflect the Company s election to opt into the regulators joint CECL transition provision, which allows the Company to phase in the capital impact of the adoption of CECL over the three years beginning January 1, 2022. Accordingly, capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 reflect 75 of the CECL impact and December 31, 2023 reflect 50 of the CECL impact. 
 The Company and Byline Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of CET1 capital greater than 2.5 of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The conservation buffers for the Company and Byline Bank exceed the minimum capital requirement as of September 30, 2024. 
 Provisions of state and federal banking regulations may limit, by statute, the amount of dividends that may be paid to the Company by Byline Bank without prior approval of Byline Bank s regulatory agencies. The Company is economically dependent on the cash dividends received from Byline Bank. These dividends represent the primary cash flow from operating activities used to service obligations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company received 34.5 million in cash dividends from Byline Bank, in order to pay the required interest on its outstanding subordinated note, junior subordinated debentures in connection with its trust preferred securities interest, principal and interest payments related to its term note and revolving line of credit, and to fund other Company-related activities. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received 35.0 million in cash dividends from Byline Bank, in order to pay the required interest on its outstanding subordinated note and junior subordinated debentures in connection with its trust preferred securities interest, principal and interest on its term loan and revolving line of credit, and to fund other Company-related activities.

On December 12, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of our outstanding common stock. The program was in effect from January 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023. No shares were repurchased under this program. 
 On December 6, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock. The program will be effect from January 1, 2024 until December 31, 2024, unless terminated earlier. The shares may, at the discretion of management, be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases as market conditions warrant or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the program, and the program may be discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number and share price of shares purchased under the repurchase program will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company s stock, general market and economic conditions and applicable legal requirements. The shares authorized to be repurchased represented approximately 2.9 of the Company s outstanding common stock at December 31, 2023. No shares were repurchased under this program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 On October 22, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.09 per share payable on November 19, 2024 to stockholders of record of our common stock as of November 5, 2024. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Items and Other Financing Arrangements 
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contractual or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by Byline Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral is primarily obtained in the form of commercial and residential real estate (including income producing commercial properties). 
 Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Byline Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. 
 Commitments to make loans are generally made for periods of 90 days or less. The fixed rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from 1.00 to 15.00 and maturities up to 2052. Variable rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from 4.00 to 18.00 and maturities up to 2053. 
 Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for funded instruments. We do not anticipate any material losses as a result of the commitments and standby letters of credit. 
 We enter into interest rate swaps that are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to certain variable rate loans, money market accounts and variable rate borrowings. We also enter into interest rate swaps with certain qualified borrowers to facilitate the borrowers risk management strategies and concurrently entered into mirror-image derivatives with a third party counterparty. 
 We recognize derivative financial instruments at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. We record derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition within accrued interest receivable and other assets, and accrued interest payable and other liabilities, respectively. Because the derivative assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024 do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts, these assets and liabilities are listed in the table below (dollars in thousands):

GAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Some of the financial measures included in our Selected Financial Data are not measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP. Our management uses the non GAAP financial measures set forth below in its analysis of our performance: 
 Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude certain significant items, which include impairment charges on assets held for sale and right-of-use assets, and merger-related expenses, adjusted for applicable income tax. Management believes the significant items are not indicative of or useful to measure the Company s operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Net interest income, fully taxable-equivalent and net interest margin, fully taxable-equivalent are adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. Management believes the metric provides useful comparable information to investors and that these measures may be useful for peer comparison. 

Total revenue is the combination of net interest income and non-interest income. Management believes the metric is an important measure of the Company's operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Adjusted non-interest expense is non-interest expense excluding certain significant items, which include impairment charges on assets held for sale and right-of-use assets, and merger-related expenses. 

Adjusted efficiency ratio is adjusted non-interest expense less amortization of intangible assets divided by net interest income and non-interest income. Management believes the metric is an important measure of the Company s operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Adjusted non-interest expense to average assets is adjusted non-interest expense divided by average assets. Management believes the metric is an important measure of the Company s operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Adjusted return on average stockholders equity is adjusted net income divided by average stockholders equity. Management believes the metric is an important measure of the Company s operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Adjusted return on average assets is adjusted net income divided by average assets. Management believes the metric is an important measure of the Company s operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Non-interest income to total revenues is non-interest income divided by net interest income plus non-interest income. Management believes that it is standard practice in the industry to present non-interest income as a percentage of total revenue. Accordingly, management believes providing these measures may be useful for peer comparison. 

Pre tax pre provision net income is pre tax income plus the provision for credit losses. Management believes this metric demonstrates income excluding the tax provision or benefit and the provision for credit losses, and enables investors and others to assess the Company s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. 

Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net income is pre-tax pre-provision net income excluding certain significant items, which include impairment charges on assets held for sale and right-of-use assets, and merger-related expenses. Management believes the metric is an important measure of the Company s operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Pre tax pre provision return on average assets is pre-tax income plus the provision for credit losses, divided by average assets. Management believes this ratio demonstrates profitability excluding the tax provision or benefit and excludes the provision for credit losses. 

Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision return on average assets excludes certain significant items, which include impairment charges on assets held for sale and right-of-use assets, and merger-related expenses. 

Tangible common equity is defined as total stockholders equity reduced by preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets. Management does not consider servicing assets as an intangible asset for purposes of this calculation. 

Tangible assets is defined as total assets reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. Management does not consider servicing assets as an intangible asset for purposes of this calculation. 

76 

Tangible book value per common share is calculated as tangible common equity, which is stockholders equity reduced by preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by total shares of common stock outstanding. Management believes this metric is important due to the relative changes in the book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. 

Tangible common equity to tangible assets is calculated as tangible common equity divided by tangible assets, which is total assets reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. Management believes this metric is important to investors and analysts interested in relative changes in the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. 

Tangible net income available to common stockholders is net income available to common stockholders excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization. 

Adjusted tangible net income available to common stockholders is tangible net income available to common stockholders excluding certain significant items. Management believes the metric is an important measure of the Company s operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Return on average tangible common stockholders equity is tangible net income available to common stockholders divided by average tangible common stockholders equity. Management believes the metric is an important measure of the Company s operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Adjusted return on average tangible common stockholders equity is adjusted tangible net income available to common stockholders divided by average tangible common stockholders equity. Management believes the metric is an important measure of the Company s operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

We believe that these non GAAP financial measures provide useful information to its management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however, we acknowledge that our non GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP financial measures that we and other companies use. Management also uses these measures for peer comparison.

It em 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Our primary market risk is interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of loss of net interest income or net interest margin because of changes in interest rates. 
 We seek to measure and manage the potential impact of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk occurs when interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rate risk also arises when our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts each respond differently to changes in interest rates, including as a result of explicit and implicit provisions in agreements related to such assets and liabilities and in off-balance sheet contracts that alter the applicable interest rate and cash flow characteristics as interest rates change. 
 We are also exposed to interest rate risk through the retained portion of the U.S. government guaranteed loans we make and the related servicing rights. Our U.S. government guaranteed loan portfolio is comprised primarily of SBA 7(a) loans, virtually all of which are quarterly or monthly adjustable with the prime rate. The SBA portfolio reacts differently in a rising rate environment than our other non-guaranteed portfolios. Generally, when interest rates rise, the prepayments in the SBA portfolio tend to increase. 
 Our management of interest rate risk is overseen by our Board of Directors and management asset liability committees based on a risk management infrastructure approved by our Board of Directors that outline reporting and measurement requirements. Our risk management infrastructure also requires a periodic review of all key assumptions used, such as identifying appropriate interest rate scenarios, setting loan prepayment rates based on historical analysis, non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposit lives based on historical analysis and the targeted investment term of capital. The committees closely monitor our interest sensitivity exposure, asset and liability allocation decisions, liquidity and capital positions, and local and national economic conditions and attempts to structure the loan and investment portfolios and funding sources to maximize earnings within acceptable risk tolerances. 
 We manage the interest rate risk associated with our interest-bearing liabilities by managing the interest rates and tenors associated with our borrowings from the FHLB, and deposits from our customers that we rely on for funding. We manage the interest rate risk associated with our interest-earning assets by managing the interest rates and tenors associated with our investment and loan portfolios, from time to time purchasing and selling investment securities. 
 We utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure on commercial loans when it meets our customers and Byline Bank s needs. As of September 30, 2024, we had a notional amount of 1.5 billion of interest rate derivatives outstanding that includes customer swaps and those on Byline Bank's balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of our hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of our execution, the accuracy of our valuation assumptions, the associated counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. 
 We do not engage in speculative trading activities relating to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, equities or credit. 
 
 Evaluation of Interest Rate Risk 
 We evaluate interest rate risk through the use of two different models: net interest income ("NII") simulations and economic value of equity ("EVE") simulations. The simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on equity and net interest income based on a variety of assumptions. Changes in assumptions may significantly alter the results of our simulations. 
 We use an NII simulation model to measure and evaluate potential changes in our net interest income. We run various hypothetical interest rate scenarios at least quarterly and compare these results against a scenario with no changes in interest rates. Our NII simulation model incorporates various assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results such as: (1) asset prepayment speed assumptions, (2) predefined credit spreads for both investment securities and loans, (3) re-pricing characteristics for market-rate-sensitive instruments on and off balance sheet, and (4) the effect of interest rate limitations in our assets, such as floors and caps. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset-liability management strategies and manage our interest rate risk. 
 We use an EVE simulation to analyze the Company's long-term view of interest rate risk as it analyzes the Company's future cash flows. EVE is defined as the present value of the Company's assets, less the present value of its liabilities, adjusted for off-balance sheet items, with the results showing a theoretical change in the economic value of stockholders' equity as interest rates change. Our EVE simulation model incorporates various assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results such as: (1) asset prepayment speed assumptions, (2) deposit decay rate assumptions, (3) predefined credit spreads for both investment securities and loans (4) re-pricing characteristics for market-rate-sensitive instruments on and off balance sheet, (5) amortization schedule, and (6) discount rates associated with the products on balance sheet.

We also prepare NII simulations that include a dynamic balance sheet and rate shift scenarios. When preparing, the balance sheet reflects management's growth outlook and interest rates follow a forward yield curve. The shocks are defined as gradual shifts up and down by 1/12th of the total change in rates each month for 12 months. In these dynamic balance sheet and rate shift scenarios, a gradual shift downward of 100 and 200 basis points would result in a 2.5 and 5.0 decrease to net interest income, and a gradual shift upwards of 100 and 200 basis points would result in 2.9 and 5.8 increases to net interest income, respectively, over the next 12 months. 
 The Bank's aggregate interest rate risk exposure is monitored and managed based on the economic outlook and under guidance of board-approved policy limits. The results of the simulations are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted including the timing, magnitude, frequency of interest rate changes, changes in market conditions, depositor behavior changes, and management strategies. 
 It em 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 The Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 The design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
