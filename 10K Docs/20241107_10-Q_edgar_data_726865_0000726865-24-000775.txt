Certain GAAP policies, which significantly affect the determination of financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, are summarized in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 In the opinion of management, these statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s results. Interim results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 Certain amounts reported in prior periods consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the current period. Effective in the third quarter of 2024, we collapsed the amortization of deferred gain (loss) on business sold through reinsurance line item, reclassifying the deferred gain amortization to other revenues and presenting the amortization of deferred loss within commissions and other expenses. For prior periods, the amortization of deferred gain (loss) on business sold through reinsurance is presented on a net basis within other revenues. 

The variable annuities level of aggregation includes RILA products, which are indexed variable annuities. The fixed annuities level of aggregation represents deferred fixed annuities. We have excluded amounts reported in Other Operations from our disaggregated disclosures that are attributable to the indemnity reinsurance agreements with Protective Life Insurance Company Protective and Swiss Re Life Health America, Inc Swiss Re as these contracts are fully reinsured, run-off institutional pension business in the form of group annuity and the results of certain disability income business.

Our gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity AFS securities decreased by billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As discussed further below, we do not believe the unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, required an impairment recognized in earnings as: (i) we did not intend to sell these fixed maturity AFS securities; (ii) it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity AFS securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis; and (iii) the difference in the fair value compared to the amortized cost was due to factors other than credit loss. Based upon this evaluation as of September 30, 2024, management believes we have the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from our normal operations (e.g., insurance premiums, fee income and investment income) to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety without requiring the sale of our impaired securities. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses associated with our corporate bond, U.S. government bond, state and municipal bond and foreign government bond securities were attributable primarily to rising interest rates and widening credit spreads since purchase. We performed a detailed analysis of the financial performance of the underlying issuers and determined that we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of each impaired security. 
 
 Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a security. Securities rated investment grade (those rated BBB- or higher by S P Global Ratings S P or Baa3 or higher by Moody s Investors Service Moody s )) are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, of the fair value of our corporate bond portfolio was rated investment grade. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the portion of our corporate bond portfolio rated below investment grade had an amortized cost of billion and billion, respectively, and a fair value of billion and billion, respectively. Based upon the analysis discussed above, we believe that as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we would have recovered the amortized cost of each corporate bond. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the unrealized losses associated with our mortgage-backed securities MBS and asset-backed securities ABS were attributable primarily to rising interest rates and widening credit spreads since purchase. We assessed for credit impairment using a cash flow model that incorporates key assumptions including default rates, severities and prepayment rates. We estimated losses for a security by forecasting the underlying loans in each transaction. The forecasted loan performance was used to project cash flows to the various tranches in the structure, as applicable. Our forecasted cash flows also considered, as applicable, independent industry analyst reports and forecasts and other independent market data. Based upon our assessment of the expected credit losses of the security given the performance of the underlying collateral compared to our subordination or other credit enhancement, we expected to recover the entire amortized cost of each impaired security.

 As of September 30, 2024, million of t he deferred net gains (losses) on derivative instruments in AOCI were expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months. This reclassification would be due primarily to interest rate variances related to our interest rate swap agreements. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , there were no material reclassifications to earnings due to hedged firm commitments no longer deemed probable or due to hedged forecasted transactions that had not occurred by the end of the originally specified time period.

 (4) Sellers do not have the right to demand indemnification or compensation from third parties in case of a loss (payment) on the contract. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, we did not have any exposure related to CDSs for which we are the seller. 
 
 Less: Counterparty thresholds Maximum collateral potentially required to post 
 
 Certain of our CDS agreements contain contractual provisions that allow for the netting of collateral with our counterparties related to all of our collateralized financing transactions that we have outstanding. If these netting agreements were not in place, our counterparties would have been required to post million of collateral as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties on various derivative contracts and reflect assumptions regarding the credit or non-performance risk. The non-performance risk is based upon assumptions for each counterparty s credit spread over the estimated weighted average life of the counterparty exposure, less collateral held. As of September 30, 2024 , the non-performance risk adjustment was zero. The credit risk associated with such agreements is minimized by entering into agreements with financial institutions with long-standing, superior performance records. Additionally, we maintain a policy of requiring derivative contracts to be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA Master Agreement. We are required to maintain minimum ratings as a matter of routine practice in negotiating ISDA agreements. Under nearly all ISDA agreements, we and LLANY have agreed to maintain certain financial strength ratings. A downgrade below these levels could result in termination of derivative contracts, at which time any amounts payable by us would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contracts. In certain transactions, we and the counterparty have entered into a credit support annex requiring either party to post collateral when net exposures exceed pre-determined thresholds. These thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating. The amount of such exposure is essentially the net replacement cost or market value less collateral held for such agreements with each counterparty if the net market value is in our favor. We did not have any exposure as of September 30, 2024 , or December 31, 2023 .

(1) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments, unless otherwise noted. 
 (2) The liquidity/duration adjustment input represents an estimated market participant composite of adjustments attributable to liquidity premiums, expected durations, structures and credit quality that would be applied to the market observable information of an investment.

Table of Contents 

From the table above, we have excluded Level 3 fair value measurements obtained from independent, third-party pricing sources. We do not develop the significant inputs used to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities, and the information regarding the significant inputs is not readily available to us. Independent broker-quoted fair values are non-binding quotes developed by market makers or broker-dealers obtained from third-party sources recognized as market participants. The fair value of a broker-quoted asset or liability is based solely on the receipt of an updated quote from a single market maker or a broker-dealer recognized as a market participant as we do not adjust broker quotes when used as the fair value measurement for an asset or liability. Significant increases or decreases in any of the quotes received from a third-party broker-dealer may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. 
 
 The embedded derivative liability associated with Fortitude Re was excluded from the above table. As discussed in Note 7 , this embedded derivative liability was created through a coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreement where the investments supporting the reinsurance agreement were withheld by and continue to be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This reinsurance-related embedded derivative is valued as a total return swap with reference to the fair value of the investments held by us. Accordingly, the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation of the reinsurance-related embedded derivative are a component of the investments supporting the reinsurance agreement that are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 Changes in any of the significant inputs presented in the table above would have resulted in a significant change in the fair value measurement of the asset or liability as follows: 
 
 Investments An increase in the liquidity/duration adjustment input would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement. 
 Indexed annuity contracts embedded derivatives For direct embedded derivatives, an increase in the lapse or mortality inputs would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement 
 LPR ceded derivative Assuming our LPR ceded derivative is in an asset position: an increase in our lapse, non-performance risk or mortality inputs would have resulted in an increase in the fair value measurement. 
 MRBs Assuming our MRBs are in a liability position: an increase in our lapse, non-performance risk or mortality inputs would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value measurement, except for policies with guaranteed death benefit GDB riders only, in which case an increase in mortality inputs would have resulted in an increase in the fair value measurement. 
 
 For each category discussed above, the unobservable inputs are not inter-related; therefore, a directional change in one input would not have affected the other inputs.

 million, after-tax. Any estimate is not an indication of expected loss, if any, or of the Company s maximum possible loss exposure on such matters. 
 
 For other matters, we are not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. We are often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts and the progress of settlement negotiations. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and update our accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews. 
 
 Among other matters, we are presently engaged in litigation, including relating to cost of insurance rates Cost of Insurance and Other Litigation ), as described below. No accrual has been made for some of these matters. Although a loss is believed to be reasonably possible for these matters, for some of these matters, we are not able to estimate a reasonably possible amount or range of potential

The following Management s Narrative Analysis of the Results of Operations MNA is intended to help the reader understand the financial condition as of September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the corresponding periods in 2023 of The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company LNL and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, LNL, Company, we, our or us refers to The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. LNL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lincoln National Corporation LNC ). The MNA is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes presented in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023; and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 
 
 MNA is presented pursuant to General Instructions H(2)(a) of Form 10-Q in lieu of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 See Part I Item 1. Business in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 1 herein for a description of the business. 
 
 In this report, in addition to providing consolidated revenues and net income (loss), we also provide segment operating revenues and income (loss) from operations because we believe they are meaningful measures of revenues and the profitability of our operating segments. Operating revenues and income (loss) from operations are the financial performance measures we use to evaluate and assess the results of our segments. Accordingly, we define and report operating revenues and income (loss) from operations by segment in Note 15 . Our management believes that operating revenues and income (loss) from operations explain the results of our ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in our current businesses. Certain items are excluded from operating revenue and income (loss) from operations because they are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance of the business segments, and, in many instances, decisions regarding these items do not necessarily relate to the operations of the individual segments. In addition, we believe that our definitions of operating revenues and income (loss) from operations will provide readers with a more valuable measure of our performance because it better reveals trends in our business. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE 
 
 Certain statements made in this report and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 PSLRA ).

 The risks and uncertainties included here are not exhaustive. Our 2023 Form 10-K as well as other reports that we file with the SEC include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors. 
 
 We do not intend, and are under no obligation, to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors herein for a discussion of certain risks relating to our business segments and products. 

SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The MNA included in our 2023 Form 10-K contains a detailed discussion of our critical accounting estimates. The following information updates the Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates provided in our 2023 Form 10-K, and therefore, should be read in conjunction with that disclosure.

Derivatives 
 
 Derivatives are primarily used for hedging purposes. We hedge certain portions of our exposure to interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity market risk, basis risk, commodity risk and credit risk by entering into derivative transactions. We also purchase and issue financial instruments that contain embedded derivative instruments. See Policyholder Account Balances below for information on embedded derivatives. Assessing the effectiveness of hedging and evaluating the carrying values of the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates 
 
 We carry our derivative instruments at fair value, which we determine through valuation techniques or models that use market data inputs or independent broker quotations. The fair values fluctuate from period to period due to the volatility of the valuation inputs, including but not limited to swap interest rates, interest and equity volatility and equity index levels, foreign currency forward and spot rates, credit spreads and correlations, some of which are significantly affected by economic conditions. The effect to revenue is reported in realized gain (loss) and such amount along with the associated federal income taxes is excluded from income (loss) from operations of our segments. 
 
 For more information on derivatives, see Note 1 in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 5 herein. For more information on market exposures associated with our derivatives, including sensitivities, see Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Future Contract Benefits 
 
 Future contract benefits represent liability reserves that we have established and carry based on estimates of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. 
 
 Liability for Future Policy Benefits 
 
 Liability for future policy benefits LFPB represents the reserve amounts associated with non-participating traditional life insurance contracts and limited payment life-contingent annuity contracts that are calculated to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. Establishing adequate reserves for our obligations to policyholders requires assumptions to be made that are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. If actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required. Significant assumptions include mortality rates, morbidity and policyholder behavior (e.g., persistency) and withdrawals. During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the actuarial assumptions to best estimate future premium and benefit cash flows cash flow assumptions and projection models used in estimating these liabilities and update these assumptions as needed (excluding the claims settlement expense assumption that is locked-in at inception) in the calculation of the net premium ratio. We may also update these assumptions in other quarters as we become aware of information that is indicative of the need for such an update. See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. In measuring our LFPB, we establish cohorts, which are groupings of long-duration contracts. On a quarterly basis, we retrospectively update the net premium ratio at the cohort level for actual experience. For all contract cohorts issued after January 1, 2021, interest is accrued on LFPB at the single-A interest rate on the contract cohort inception date. For contract cohorts issued prior to January 1, 2021, interest remains accruing at the original discount rate in effect on the contract cohort inception date due to the modified retrospective transition method. We also remeasure the LFPB using the single-A interest rate as of the end of each reporting period. 
 
 Liability for Future Claims 
 
 Future contract benefits include reserves for long-term life and disability claims associated with our Group Protection segment. These reserves use actuarial assumptions primarily based on claim termination rates, offsets for other insurance including social security and long-term disability incidence and severity assumptions. Such cash flow assumptions are subject to the comprehensive review process discussed above. We remeasure the liability for future claims using a single-A interest rate as of the end of each reporting period. See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. 
 
 Universal Life Insurance Products with Secondary Guarantees 
 
 We issue UL-type contracts where we provide a secondary guarantee to the policyholder. The policy can remain in force, even if the base policy account balance is zero, as long as contractual secondary guarantee requirements have been met. These guaranteed benefits require an additional liability that is calculated based on the application of a benefit ratio (calculated as the present value of total expected benefit payments over the life of the contract from inception divided by the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract). These secondary guarantees are reported within future contract benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The level and direction of the change in reserves will vary over time based on the emergence of the benefit ratio and the level of assessments associated with the contracts. Cash flow assumptions incorporated in a benefit ratio in measuring these additional liabilities for other insurance benefits include mortality rates, morbidity, policyholder behavior (e.g., persistency) and withdrawals based principally on generally

accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the cash flow assumptions and projection models used in estimating these liabilities and update these assumptions in the calculation of the benefit ratio. We may also update these assumptions in other quarters as we become aware of information that is indicative of the need for such an update. See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. 
 
 For additional information on future contract benefits, see Note 11 . 
 
 Market Risk Benefits 
 
 MRBs are contracts or contract features that provide protection to the policyholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose us to other-than-nominal capital market risk upon the occurrence of a specific event or circumstance, such as death, annuitization or periodic withdrawal. An MRB can be in either an asset or a liability position. Our MRB assets and MRB liabilities are reported at fair value separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 We issue variable and fixed annuity contracts that may include various types of guaranteed living benefit GLB and guaranteed death benefit GDB riders that we have accounted for as MRBs. For contracts that contain multiple riders that qualify as MRBs, the MRBs are valued on a combined basis using an integrated model. We have entered into reinsurance agreements to cede certain GLB and GDB riders where the reinsurance agreements themselves are accounted for as MRBs or contain MRBs. We therefore record ceded MRB assets and ceded MRB liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements. We report ceded MRBs associated with these reinsurance agreements in other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Change in the fair value of MRB assets and liabilities is reported in market risk benefit gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), except for the portion attributable to the change in non-performance risk, which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) OCI ). Change in the fair value of ceded MRB assets and liabilities, including the changes in our counterparties non-performance risks, is reported in market risk benefit gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
 
 MRBs are valued based on a stochastic projection of risk-neutral scenarios that incorporate a spread reflecting our non-performance risk. Ceded MRBs are valued based on a stochastic projection of risk-neutral scenarios that incorporate a spread reflecting our counterparties non-performance risk. The scenario assumptions, at each valuation date, are those we view to be appropriate for a hypothetical market participant and include assumptions for capital markets, lapse, benefit utilization, mortality, risk margin and administrative expenses. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical data and actuarial judgments. The assumption for our own non-performance risk and our counterparties non-performance risk for MRBs and ceded MRBs, respectively, are determined at each valuation date and reflect our risk and our counterparties risks of not fulfilling the obligations of the underlying liability. The spread for the non-performance risk is added to the discount rates used in determining the fair value from the net cash flows. We believe these assumptions are consistent with those that would be used by a market participant; however, as the related markets develop, we will continue to reassess our assumptions. During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these MRBs and update these assumptions on a prospective basis as needed. We may also update these assumptions in other quarters as we become aware of information that is indicative of the need for such an update. For information on fair value inputs, see Note 12 . See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. 
 
 We cede a portion of these GLB and GDB features to Lincoln National Reinsurance Company (Barbados) Limited LNBAR on a modified coinsurance basis. The modified coinsurance arrangement includes a hedging strategy designed to mitigate selected risk to LNBAR. The hedge program focuses on generating sufficient income to fund future claims with a goal of maximizing distributable earnings and explicitly protecting capital. This hedging strategy utilizes options and total return swaps on U.S.-based equity indices, and futures on U.S.-based and international equity indices, as well as interest rate futures, interest rate swaps and currency futures. 
 
 As part of the hedge program, equity market and interest rate conditions are monitored on a daily basis. The hedge positions are rebalanced based upon changes in these factors as needed. While the hedge positions are actively managed, these positions may not completely offset changes in the fair value of the GLB and GDB riders caused by movements in these factors due to, among other things, differences in timing between when a market exposure changes and corresponding changes to the hedge positions, extreme swings in the equity markets, interest rates and market-implied volatilities, realized market volatility, policyholder behavior, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices, divergence between the actual and expected performance of the hedge instruments or ability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with the desired risk and return trade-off. 
 
 The hedging results do not impact LNL due to the modified coinsurance arrangement with LNBAR, as LNL cedes these derivative results to LNBAR. For additional information on MRBs, see Note 8 .

Policyholder Account Balances 
 
 Policyholder account balances include the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability includes universal life insurance UL and variable universal life insurance VUL and investment-type annuity products where account balances are equal to deposits plus interest credited less withdrawals, surrender charges, asset-based fees and policyholder administration charges (collectively known as policyholder assessments ), as well as amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with our indexed universal life insurance IUL and indexed annuity products. During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models underlying our reserves and embedded derivatives and update assumptions as needed. We may also update these assumptions in other quarters as we become aware of information that is indicative of the need for such an update. See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. 
 
 Our indexed annuity and IUL contracts permit the holder to elect a fixed interest rate return or a return where interest credited to the contracts is linked to the performance of the S P 500 Index or other indices. The value of the variable portion of the policyholder s account balance varies with the performance of the underlying variable funds chosen by the policyholder. Policyholders may elect to rebalance among the various accounts within the product at renewal dates. At the end of each indexed term, which can be up to six years, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component by establishing different participation rates, caps, spreads or specified rates, subject to contractual guarantees. We purchase and sell index options that are highly correlated to the portfolio allocation decisions of our policyholders, such that we are economically hedged with respect to equity returns for the current reset period. The mark-to-market of the options held generally offsets the change in value of the embedded derivative within the contract, both of which are recorded as a component of realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Derivatives and Hedging and the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification TM require that we calculate fair values of index options we may purchase or sell in the future to hedge policyholder index allocations in future reset periods. These fair values represent an estimate of the cost of the options we will purchase or sell in the future, discounted back to the date of the balance sheet, using current market indicators of volatility and interest rates. Changes in the fair values of these liabilities are included as a component of realized gain (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). For more information on indexed product derivative results, see Note 16 . 
 
 For additional information on the liability for policyholder account balances, see Note 10 . 
 
 Reinsurance Recoverables 
 
 Reinsurance recoverables are generally measured and recognized consistent with the assumptions and methodologies used to project the future performance of the underlying direct business as discussed in the Future Contract Benefits and Policyholder Account Balances sections above. During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models and update assumptions as needed. See Annual Assumption Review below for more information. In addition, we consider the potential impact of counterparty credit risks related to the reinsurance recoverable by estimating an allowance for credit losses using a probability of loss model approach to estimate expected credit losses for reinsurance recoverables. For additional information on our allowance for credit losses on reinsurance-related assets, see Note 8 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Annual Assumption Review 
 
 During the third quarter of each year, we conduct our comprehensive review of the assumptions and projection models used in estimating MRBs, our reserves and embedded derivatives. For more information on our comprehensive review, see Note 1 in our 2023 Form 10-K. Details underlying the effect to net income (loss) from our annual assumption review (in millions) were as follows: 
 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Income (loss) from operations: Annuities 1 (12) Life Insurance 58 (119) Group Protection 15 24 Retirement Plan Services Excluded from income (loss) from operations 96 (47) Net income (loss) 170 (154) 
 
 73 

Table of Contents 

The impacts of our annual assumption review were driven primarily by the following: 
 
 2024 
 For Life Insurance, the favorable impact was driven by updates to mortality and capital market assumptions and other items, partially offset by unfavorable updates to policyholder behavior assumptions. 
 For Group Protection, the favorable impact was driven by updates to life waiver incurred assumptions. 
 For excluded from income (loss) from operations, the favorable impact, related to net annuity product features, was driven by model enhancements. 
 
 2023 
 For Annuities, the unfavorable impact was driven by updates to mortality assumptions. 
 For Life Insurance, the unfavorable impact was driven by updates to policyholder lapse behavior and mortality assumptions, partially offset by the favorable impact of a 50-basis-points increase in our long-term new money investment yield assumption. 
 For Group Protection, the favorable impact was driven by updates to long-term disability and life waiver claim termination rate assumptions, partially offset by the unfavorable impact due to updates to long-term disability social security offset assumptions. 
 For excluded from income (loss) from operations, the unfavorable impact, related to net annuity product features, was driven by updates to mortality and policyholder lapse behavior assumptions and other items, partially offset by a favorable impact from updates to volatility and policyholder GLB utilization behavior assumptions. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2024, we will perform our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2024, on all of our reporting units. For more information on goodwill, see Part II Item 7. Management s Narrative Analysis of the Results of Operations Introduction Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Notes 1 and 9 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining the income taxes payable or refundable for the current year, the deferred income tax assets and liabilities for items recognized differently in its financial statements from amounts shown on its income tax returns and the federal income tax expense. Determining these amounts requires analysis and interpretation of current tax laws and regulations. Management exercises judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax assets and liabilities. These judgments and estimates are re-evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Legislative changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, modifications or new regulations, administrative rulings, or court decisions could increase or decrease our effective tax rate. 
 
 The application of GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realizable. Judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider many factors, including: the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; future reversals of existing temporary differences; the length of time carryovers can be utilized; and any future prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a 960 million deferred tax asset related to net unrealized losses on fixed maturity available-for-sale AFS securities. In the assessment of the future realizability of this deferred tax asset, management concluded that its tax planning strategy to hold these securities to recovery was prudent and feasible as these unrealized losses were caused by factors other than credit loss, and we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to recovery and collect all of the contractual cash flows. 
 
 Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, will be realized. 
 
 For risks related to establishing a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Assumptions and Estimates We may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to 2023 
 
 Net income decreased due primarily to the following: 
 
 Loss in net annuity product features in 2024 compared to gain in 2023, driven by unfavorable changes in interest rates in 2024 compared to favorable changes in 2023, partially offset by favorable changes in equity markets in 2024 compared to unfavorable changes in 2023, driving MRB-related impacts. 
 Unfavorable changes in the fair value of reinsurance-related embedded derivatives, trading securities and certain mortgage loans in 2024 compared to favorable changes in 2023, driven by changes in the fair value of reinsurance-related embedded derivatives due primarily to the second quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction and the impact of capital markets. 
 Loss in net life insurance product features in 2024 compared to gain in 2023 driven by mark-to-market losses on hedges associated with VUL products and less favorable benefit ratio impacts as a result of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction. 
 Higher credit loss-related adjustments on mortgage loans on real estate and fixed maturity AFS securities. 
 
 The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following: 
 
 Lower investment losses driven by intent to sell impairment in 2023 on fixed maturity AFS securities as part of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction. 
 Favorable impact from our annual assumption review in 2024 compared to unfavorable impact in 2023. 
 Growth in average account balances. 
 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to 2023 
 
 Net income increased due primarily to the following: 
 
 Lower investment losses driven by intent to sell impairment in 2023 on fixed maturity AFS securities as part of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction. 
 Gain on other non-financial assets due to the sale of the wealth management business in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Favorable impact from our annual assumption review in 2024 compared to unfavorable impact in 2023. 
 Growth in average account balances. 
 
 The increase in net income was partially offset by the following: 
 
 Loss in net life insurance product features in 2024 compared to gain in 2023 driven by less favorable benefit ratio impacts as a result of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction and mark-to-market losses on hedges associated with VUL products. 
 Lower gain in net annuity product features driven by less favorable changes in interest rates, partially offset by more favorable changes in equity markets, driving MRB-related impacts. 
 Unfavorable changes in the fair value of reinsurance-related embedded derivatives, trading securities and certain mortgage loans in 2024 compared to favorable changes in 2023, driven by changes in the fair value of reinsurance-related embedded derivatives due primarily to the second quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction and the impact of capital markets.

 (1) Insurance premiums include primarily our income annuities that have a corresponding offset in benefits. Benefits include primarily changes in income annuity reserves driven by insurance premiums. 
 (2) Consists primarily of revenues attributable to broker-dealer services, which are subject to market volatility and have a comparable offset in commissions and other expenses; and the net settlement related to certain reinsurance transactions, which has a corresponding offset in net investment income and interest credited. On May 6, 2024, LNC closed the previously announced sale of the wealth management business. See Note 1 for more information. 
 
 Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to 2023 
 
 Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following: 
 
 Higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account balances. 
 Lower policyholder liability remeasurement loss driven by the impact from our annual assumption review. 
 
 The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following: 
 
 Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, which more than offset impacts from higher average fixed account balances and improving portfolio yields from the current interest rate environment. The lower net investment income, net of interest credited, was experienced in certain reinsured portfolios that have a corresponding increase in other revenues and decrease in benefits. 
 Higher commissions and other expenses, net of broker-dealer expenses, driven by higher trail commissions resulting from higher average daily variable account balances. 
 
 The increase in income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was also partially offset by higher federal income tax expense due to the separate account dividends-received deduction in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 See Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Annual Assumption Review above for information on the impacts from our annual assumption review. 
 
 Additional Information 
 
 Effective June 30, 2024, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Lincoln Pinehurst Reinsurance Company (Bermuda) Limited LPINE ), a wholly owned subsidiary of LNC, to reinsure liabilities under certain blocks of in-force fixed annuities. See Note 7 for more information.

New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations. 
 
 The other component of net flows relates to the retention of new business and account balances. An important measure of retention is the reduction in account balances caused by full surrenders, deaths and other contract benefits. These outflows as a percentage of average gross account balances were 11 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 9 for the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 
 Our fixed annuities and registered index-linked annuities have discretionary fixed and indexed crediting rates that reset on an annual or periodic basis and may be subject to surrender charges. Our ability to retain these annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time crediting rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Market Conditions Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our profitability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements, Part I Item 1A.

 (1) Includes term insurance premiums, which have a corresponding partial offset in benefits for changes in reserves. 
 
 Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to 2023 
 
 Income from operations for this segment increased due primarily to the following: 
 
 Lower benefits and policyholder liability remeasurement loss driven by the run-rate impact of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction and the impact from our annual assumption review. 
 Higher other revenues driven by the run-rate impact of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction. 
 
 The increase in income from operations was partially offset by the following: 
 
 Lower fee income driven by the run-rate impact of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction. 
 Lower net investment income, net of interest credited, driven by the run-rate impact of the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction, partially offset by higher investment income on alternative investments. 
 
 Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in income from operations was driven by lower commissions and other expenses driven by expense management. 
 
 For more information on the fourth quarter 2023 reinsurance transaction, see Additional Information below. 
 
 See Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Annual Assumption Review above for information on the impacts from our annual assumption review. 
 
 Additional Information 
 
 Effective October 1, 2023, we entered into reinsurance agreements with Fortitude Reinsurance Company Ltd. and LNBAR to reinsure liabilities under certain blocks of in-force UL with secondary guarantees ULSG and MoneyGuard . We expect an ongoing unfavorable impact to operating results in future quarters of approximately 20 million to 25 million per quarter as a result of this reinsurance transaction. See Note 7 for more information on the transaction, which improved our capital position and is expected to be accretive to ongoing free cash flow. 
 
 Generally, we experience higher mortality in the first quarter of the year due to the seasonality of claims.

 Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 to 2023 
 
 Income from operations for this segment decreased due primarily to lower other revenues driven by the net settlement related to the second quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction. 
 
 The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by the following: 
 
 Higher insurance premiums due to growth in business in force, partially offset by the reduction in insurance premiums due to the second quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction. 
 Lower benefits, net of policyholder liability remeasurement gain, due to the second quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction and lower incidence in our life business, partially offset by the impact from our annual assumption review. 
 Lower commissions and other expenses due to the second quarter 2024 reinsurance transaction, partially offset by higher incentive compensation as a result of production performance.

 Additional Information 
 
 Effective June 30, 2024, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with LPINE to reinsure liabilities under certain blocks of in-force group protection products. Insurance premiums and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflect day one impacts of 4.5 billion attributable to the reinsurance agreement that had no income (loss) from operations effect. See Note 7 for more information. 
 
 Our total loss ratio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, not including the day one impact of the second quarter 2024 reinsurance agreement discussed above, was 72.8 and 72.6 , respectively, compared to 75.2 and 73.8 , for the corresponding periods in 2023.

 The decrease in income from operations was partially offset by higher fee income driven by higher average daily variable account balances. 
 
 Additional Information 
 
 Net flows in this business fluctuate based on the timing of larger plans being implemented and terminating over the course of the year. 
 
 New deposits are an important component of net flows and key to our efforts to grow our business. Although deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they can significantly impact future income from operations. The other component of net flows relates to the retention of the business. An important measure of retention is the reduction in account balances caused by plan sponsor terminations and participant withdrawals. These outflows as a percentage of average account balances were 13 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 12 for the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 
 82 

Table of Contents 

Our net flows are negatively affected by the continued net outflows from our oldest blocks of annuities business, which are among our higher margin product lines in this segment, due to the fact that they are mature blocks with low distribution and servicing costs. The proportion of these products to our total account balances was 13 and 16 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Due to this overall shift in business mix toward products with lower returns, new deposit production continues to be necessary to maintain earnings at current levels. 
 
 Our fixed annuity business includes products with discretionary and index-based crediting rates that are reset on either a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Our ability to retain quarterly or semi-annual reset annuities will be subject to current competitive conditions at the time crediting rates for these products reset. We expect to manage the effects of spreads on near-term income from operations through portfolio management and, to a lesser extent, crediting rate actions, which assumes no significant changes in net flows into or out of our fixed accounts or other changes that may cause interest rate spreads to differ from our expectations. For information on interest rate spreads and interest rate risk, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Market Conditions Changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease, impacting our profitability, and make it more challenging to meet certain statutory requirements, Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Market Conditions Increases in interest rates may negatively affect our profitability, capital position and the value of our investment portfolio and may also result in increased contract withdrawals and Part II Item 7A.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from our normal operations to meet cash requirements with a prudent margin of safety. Capital refers to our long-term financial resources to support the operations of our businesses, to fund long-term growth strategies and to support our operations during adverse conditions. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our businesses, general economic conditions and access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity and capital as described below. When considering our liquidity, it is important to distinguish between our needs, the needs of Lincoln Life Annuity Company of New York LLANY and the needs of the holding company, LNC. As a holding company with no operations of its own, LNC derives its cash primarily from its operating subsidiaries. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may materially affect our business operations and results of operations and may adversely affect our or LLANY s capital position. 
 
 Reductions to our or LLANY s capital position may cause us to retain more capital, which may pressure our ability to receive dividends from LLANY or pay dividends to LNC, which may lead us to take steps to preserve or raise additional capital. We believe we and LLANY have appropriate capital to operate our business in accordance with our strategy. 
 
 For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in this section and that could affect our expectations for liquidity and capital, see Forward-Looking Statements Cautionary Language above, Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and Part II Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Second Quarter 2024 Form 10-Q. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital are insurance premiums and fees, investment income, maturities and sales of investments, issuance of debt or other types of securities and policyholder deposits. We also have access to alternative sources of liquidity as discussed below. Our primary uses are to pay policy claims and benefits, to fund commissions and other general operating expenses, to purchase investments, to fund policy surrenders and withdrawals, to pay dividends to LNC and to repay debt. Our operating activities provided (used) cash of (1.8) billion and 271 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We paid cash dividends to LNC of 125 million and 320 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 105 million and 365 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, we made a 929 million extraordinary dividend in the form of investments to LNC. We also received dividends from our subsidiaries of 102 million and 358 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 76 million and 341 million for the corresponding periods in 2023. 
 
 Statutory Capital and Surplus 
 
 We must maintain certain regulatory capital levels. We utilize the RBC ratio as a primary measure of our capital adequacy. The RBC ratio is an important factor in the determination of our financial strength ratings, and a reduction in our or LLANY s surplus will affect our RBC ratios and dividend-paying capacity. For additional information on RBC ratios, see Part I Item 1. Business Regulatory Insurance Regulation Risk-Based Capital in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Our regulatory capital levels are affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator. For instance, our term products and UL products containing secondary guarantees subject to the NAIC RBC framework require reserves calculated pursuant to the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline XXXVIII AG38 ), respectively. We employ strategies to reduce the strain caused by XXX and AG38 by reinsuring the business to reinsurance captives or reinsurance subsidiaries. Our captive reinsurance subsidiaries and LNBAR provide a mechanism for financing a portion of the excess reserve amounts in a more efficient manner and free up capital we can use for any number of purposes, including paying dividends to LNC. We use long-dated letters of credit LOCs and debt financing as well as other financing strategies to finance those reserves. For information on the LOCs, see the credit facilities table in Note 14 in our 2023 Form 10-K. Our captive reinsurance subsidiaries and LNBAR have also issued long-term notes to finance a portion of the excess reserves. For information on long-term notes issued by our captive reinsurance subsidiaries, see Note 5 in our 2023 Form 10-K. We have also used the proceeds from certain senior notes issued by LNC to execute long-term structured solutions primarily supporting reinsurance of UL products containing secondary guarantees.

Table of Contents 

Statutory reserves and RBC requirements for variable annuity guaranteed benefit riders and guaranteed benefits on VUL policies are sensitive to changes in the equity markets and interest rates and are affected by the level of account balances relative to the level of any guarantees, product design and reinsurance arrangements. As a result, the relationship between reserve changes and equity market performance is non-linear during any given reporting period. We cede a portion of the variable annuity guaranteed benefit riders to LNBAR through a modified coinsurance agreement. The variable annuity hedge program mitigates the risk to LNBAR from guaranteed benefit riders and continues to focus on generating sufficient income to fund future claims with a goal of maximizing distributable earnings and explicitly protecting capital. We also use a partial hedge that mitigates potential capital volatility from guaranteed benefits on VUL policies. Market conditions greatly influence the ultimate capital required due to its effect on the valuation of reserves and supporting derivatives. 
 
 Changes in equity markets may also affect our capital position. We may decide to reallocate available capital among us and our insurance and captive reinsurance subsidiaries, which would result in different RBC ratios for us. In addition, changes in the equity markets can affect the value of our variable annuity and VUL separate accounts. When the market value of our separate account assets increases, the statutory surplus within us and LLANY also increases. Contrarily, when the market value of our separate account assets decreases, the statutory surplus within us and LLANY may also decrease, which will affect RBC ratios, and in the case of our separate account assets becoming less than the related product liabilities, we must allocate additional capital to fund the difference. 
 
 Effective June 20, 2024, we entered into a coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreement with LPINE. For more information, see Note 7 . 
 
 On May 6, 2024, LNC closed the previously announced sale of all of the ownership interests in the subsidiaries of LNC that comprised its wealth management business, including our subsidiary Lincoln Financial Advisors Corporation, to Osaic Holdings, Inc. For more information on the sale of the wealth management business, see Note 1 . 
 
 Debt 
 
 For information about our short-term and long-term debt and our credit facilities, see Note 1 4 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Alternative Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Inter-Company Cash Management Program 
 
 To promote effective short-term cash management strategies, we participate in an inter-company cash management program between LNC and its participating subsidiaries under which each entity can lend to or borrow from the holding company to meet short-term borrowing needs. As of September 30, 2024, we had a net receivable balance of 2.1 billion due from certain affiliates in the inter-company cash management program. Loans under the cash management program are permitted under applicable insurance laws subject to certain restrictions. LNL, domiciled in Indiana, is currently subject to a borrowing and lending limit of 3 of the insurance company s admitted assets as of its most recent year end. For our New York-domiciled insurance subsidiary, it may borrow from LNC less than 2 of its admitted assets as of its most recent year end but may not lend any amounts to LNC. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank 
 
 LNL is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Indianapolis FHLBI ). Membership allows LNL access to the FHLBI s financial services, including the ability to obtain loans and to issue funding agreements as an alternative source of liquidity that are collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets, agency securities or U.S. Treasury securities. Borrowings under this facility are subject to the FHLBI s discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at LNL. As of September 30, 2024, LNL had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of 7.0 billion under the FHLBI facility and maximum available borrowing based on qualifying assets of 5.0 billion. As of September 30, 2024, LNL had outstanding borrowings of 3.2 billion under this facility reported within payables for collateral on investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. LLANY is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLBNY with an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of 750 million. Borrowings under this facility are subject to the FHLBNY s discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at LLANY. As of September 30, 2024, LLANY had no outstanding borrowings under this facility. For additional information, see Payables for Collateral on Investments in Note 3 . 
 
 Repurchase Agreements and Securities Lending Programs 
 
 We and LNBAR had access to 2.75 billion of committed repurchase facilities, of which 25 million was utilized as of September 30, 2024. LNL and LLANY, by virtue of their general account fixed-income investment holdings, can also access liquidity through securities lending programs. As of September 30, 2024, we had securities pledged under securities lending agreements with a carrying value of 185 million. The cash received in our securities lending programs is typically invested in cash and invested cash or fixed maturity AFS securities. For additional information, see Payables for Collateral on Investments in Note 3 . 
 
 85 

Table of Contents 

Collateral on Derivative Contracts 
 
 Our cash flows associated with collateral received from counterparties (when we are in a net collateral payable position) and posted with counterparties (when we are in a net collateral receivable position) change as the market value of the underlying derivative contract changes. The net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. As of September 30, 2024, we were in a net collateral payable position of 7.1 billion compared to 4.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. In the event of adverse changes in fair value of our derivative instruments, we may need to return collateral to counterparties or post collateral to counterparties. If we do not have sufficient high quality securities or cash to provide as collateral to counterparties, we have alternative sources of liquidity. In addition to the liquidity from repurchase agreements and FHLB facilities discussed above, we also have a 500 million liquidity facility that is contingent upon interest rates and the five-year revolving credit facility discussed in Note 14 in our 2023 Form 10-K. Alternative liquidity sources include uncommitted repurchase agreements and selling highly liquid assets in the general account. For additional information, see Credit Risk in Note 5. 
 
 Ratings 
 
 Financial Strength Ratings 
 
 See Part I Item 1. Business Financial Strength Ratings in our 2023 Form 10-K for information on our financial strength ratings. 
 
 If our current financial strength ratings were downgraded in the future, terms in our derivative agreements and/or certain repurchase agreements may be triggered, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of our derivative counterparties, there is a termination event if our financial strength ratings drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S P Global Ratings S P )/Moody s Investor Service Moody s )). For certain repurchase agreements, there is a termination event if the long-term credit ratings of LNC drop below BBB-/Baa3 (S P/Moody s) or our financial strength ratings drop below BBB+/Baa1 (S P/Moody s). In addition, contractual selling agreements with intermediaries could be negatively affected, which could have an adverse effect on overall sales of annuities, life insurance and investment products. 
 
 See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Covenants and Ratings A downgrade in our financial strength ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We analyze and manage the risks arising from market exposures of financial instruments, as well as other risks, in an integrated asset-liability management process that considers diversification. We have exposures to several market risks including interest rate risk, equity market risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk. For information on these market risks, see Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our President (the principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period required by this report, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). 
 
 Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, based solely on the material weakness described below, in timely alerting them to material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Exchange Act. 
 
 Existence of Material Weakness 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In the course of preparing our financial statements for the interim period ended June 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting related to the design of the Company s controls over the calculation of amounts pertaining to certain affiliate reinsurance treaties. Specifically, controls were not designed to review the accuracy of 
 86 

Table of Contents 

 system code changes and to ensure the data used to record ceded premiums and claims for certain affiliate reinsurance treaties was complete, accurate, and in accordance with the contractual terms of the treaties. The material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting did not result in a material misstatement to the Company s previously issued consolidated financial statements but did result in immaterial out-of-period adjustments to ceded premiums and claims for the interim period ended September 30, 2024. Affiliate transactions eliminate in consolidation for purposes of reporting and disclosure for our Parent Company, LNC, and therefore, this control assessment is not applicable to and has no effect on LNC s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Because of this material weakness, management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Remediation Plan 
 
 Since identifying the material weakness related to management s controls over the calculation of amounts related to certain affiliate reinsurance treaties, management has taken the following steps towards remediating the material weakness: 
 
 The establishment of a control to ensure code changes implemented to calculate affiliate reinsurance amounts are operating as intended and utilizing complete and accurate data. 
 The formation of a reinsurance governance function under which retrospective reviews of affiliate reinsurance deals will be performed and reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure actual results are in line with deal model expectations. 
 
 The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, has not been audited by an independent public accounting firm as it is not required by the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except as noted above with the respect to the identification and implementation of remediating controls with respect to the material weakness, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
