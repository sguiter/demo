 (1) For presentation purposes, stock options issued with a Canadian dollar exercise price have been translated to U.S. dollars based on the prevailing exchange rate on the date of grant. 
 (2) The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing price of the Company's common shares on the last trading day of the period and on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively ).

 The fair value of the stock options has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and credited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, using the grant date fair value based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value of stock options include exercise price, risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, and average life of an option.

The average life of an option is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company's common shares and historical volatility of the Company's common shares over the expected life of the option. There were issuances of options during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

General Matters 
 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Viemed Healthcare, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
 
 We were incorporated on December 14, 2016 pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). As of June 30, 2020, we determined that we no longer qualify as a "foreign private issuer," as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act, for the purposes of the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, we became subject to the proxy solicitation rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders became subject to the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. We will continue to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC and with the relevant Canadian securities regulatory authorities on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR). 
 
 We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act, and as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements. 

Overview 
 
 We provide an array of home medical equipment, services and supplies, specializing in post-acute respiratory care services in the United States. Our primary objective is to focus on the organic growth of the business and thereby solidify our position as one of the United States largest providers of in-home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases. Our respiratory care programs are designed specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior quality of care. Our services include respiratory disease management (through the rental of various HME devices), neuromuscular care, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea treatment, oxygen therapy, and the sale of associated supplies. 
 
 We derive the majority of our revenue through the rental of non-invasive and invasive ventilators which represented 54.8 and 57.3 of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 55.9 and 59.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We combine the benefits of home ventilation support with licensed Respiratory Therapists ("RTs") to drive improved patient outcomes and reduce costly hospital readmissions. 
 
 We expect to grow through expansion of existing service areas as well as in new territories through a cost efficient launch that reduces location expenses. We currently serve patients in all 50 states. We expect to continue to employ more RTs in order to assure our high service model is accomplished in the home. As of September 30, 2024, we employed 398 licensed RTs, representing approximately 35 of our company-wide employee count. By focusing overhead costs on personnel that service the patient rather than physical location costs, we anticipate that we will efficiently scale our business in regions that are currently not being effectively serviced. 
 
 The continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with our business objective and we anticipate that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for us. We expect to continue to be a solution to the rising health costs in the United States by offering more cost effective, home based solutions while increasing the quality of life for patients fighting serious respiratory diseases.

Trends Affecting our Business 
 
 Home medical equipment markets are witnessing sustained expansion, with a notable focus on the complex respiratory and Obstructive Sleep Apnea ("OSA") device segments. Analysts in the industry anticipate a consistent and robust growth trajectory, projecting Compound Annual Growth Rates ("CAGR") of approximately 6 for respiratory devices and 8 for OSA devices. This upward trend underscores the increasing demand for innovative solutions in respiratory care and sleep apnea management, highlighting the industry's responsiveness to evolving healthcare needs. As technological advancements and awareness drive the adoption of these specialized devices, we believe the HME markets, particularly in respiratory and OSA, are positioned for continuous expansion, offering promising opportunities for both providers and consumers alike. 
 
 The aging population remains a pivotal driver for the industry, as the elderly, constituting a substantial portion of HME patients, are expected to represent a higher percentage of the overall population. Projections from industry analysts indicate a consistent annual growth in the number of Medicare beneficiaries, contributing to ongoing patient volume growth. A significant contributing factor to the industry's growth is the rising incidence of chronic diseases. Factors such as increasing obesity rates, consequences of past smoking prevalence, under-diagnosis of certain health conditions, and higher diagnosis rates for chronic diseases collectively shape the industry. There is a notable shift towards home-based treatment for these conditions. 
 
 The industry is undergoing a transition to value-based healthcare, with both government and commercial payors increasingly adopting models that emphasize the transition of patients from acute care settings to home care. We believe HME providers are well-positioned to benefit from this industry shift. Advancements in technology and medical equipment have led to an increased prevalence of in-home treatments. The broader range of treatments administered in patient homes is expected to continue growing. Projections from industry analysts indicate that U.S. home healthcare spending will increase, reaching 250 billion by 2031, with a CAGR of approximately 7 . 
 
 Market consolidation is a notable trend favoring larger, financially stable players. The decline in the number of smaller regional players is attributed to the capital investment and scale required to compete effectively. This has led to a more consolidated and competitive landscape in the DME market. 
 
 Despite these positive trends, the industry faces challenges such as cost containment efforts of payors. The consolidation of managed care payors into larger purchasing groups has increased negotiating power, resulting in pricing pressure on HME providers. In addition to ongoing negotiations relating to contract management with third party payors to secure fair reimbursement, HME providers are engaging in value-based contracting, focusing on outcomes and patient satisfaction. These value-based contracts leverage data analytics to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and quality of durable medical goods and provide evidence-based data to payors demonstrating the long-term benefits and cost savings associated with the use of certain medical goods. 
 
 Impact of Inflation 
 
 The Company faces current and potential future inflationary pressures driven by factors such as general cost increases, supply chain disruptions, and governmental policies. The manufacturing and distribution costs of Viemed's patient equipment are affected by rising material, labor, and transportation expenses, including fuel costs. Persistent inflation may impact overall demand, increase operating costs, and affect profit margins, potentially adversely affecting Viemed's business and financial performance. 
 
 In its 2024 DMEPOS Fee Schedule, CMS announced the fee schedule adjustment based on the annual change to the Consumer Pricing Index for all urban areas. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in former competitive bidding areas will receive a 2.9 reimbursement rate increase. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in non-competitive bidding areas received a 3.0 reimbursement rate increase. Items not subject to the competitive bidding program received a 2.6 reimbursement rate increase. 
 
 Future volatility in general price inflation and its impact on material availability, shipping, warehousing, and operational overhead could further impact financial results. Viemed attempts to address these pressures through its inflation-linked reimbursement contracts, negotiation, leveraging its purchasing power and embracing technology, such as its proprietary clinical management platform.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue totaled 58.0 million, an increase of 8.6 million (or 17.4 from the comparable period in 2023. The primary driver of this growth was our ventilator rental revenue, which increased by 3.5 million (or 12.2 due to higher patient volumes associated with strong demand for ventilation services. Additionally, services revenue saw a notable increase of 3.1 million (or 140.3 primarily due to the expansion of our healthcare staffing services. Rental revenue from other Home Medical Equipment (HME) contributed an increase of 1.3 million (or 12.1 driven by growing demand for oxygen therapy, Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy, and percussion vest services. Equipment and supply sales increased by 0.7 million (or 9.0 largely driven by the success of our sleep resupply program. 
 
 Page 29 

VIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 (Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts) September 30, 2024 and 2023 

While ventilator rentals continue to make up the majority of our revenue, the growth of PAP and oxygen related sales, as well as our healthcare staffing offerings, is contributing to the diversity of our overall revenue mix. As we continue to expand geographically into new territories and further expand our presence in our existing territories, we expect continued growth in our active ventilator patient base and our other respiratory offerings. 
 
 Cost of revenue and gross profit 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenue totaled 23.6 million, an increase of 4.8 million (or 25.4 from the comparable period in 2023. Gross profit percentage decreased from approximately 61.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 59.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in gross profit percentage is primarily due to migration of the revenue mix associated with product and service diversification. Gross profit percentage is expected to remain relatively stable in upcoming periods due to subsiding inflationary cost pressures and the positive effects associated with reimbursement rates, offset by some decreases associated with product and service diversification. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 46.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 47.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 26.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.0 million (or 12.8 from the comparable prior period. The improvement in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is attributable to economies of scale and improvements in operational efficiencies. The overall increase in selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to additional employee related expenses to accommodate the overall growth of the Company. Employee compensation expenses increased 3.0 million (or 18.6 as a result of the increase in our employee headcount and increases in market-based compensation. We expect that current year selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain stable through the end of 2024 due to increased efficiencies and costs optimization efforts relative to revenue growth. 
 
 Research and development 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expense totaled 0.8 million, an increase of 0.2 million from the comparable period in 2023. As we continue to invest in research and development related projects to support our technology initiatives, we expect that associated costs will remain consistent in 2024 relative to 2023 costs. 
 
 Stock-based compensation 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation totaled 1.7 million, an increase of 17.8 from the comparable period in 2023. We anticipate that as we expand our workforce, incorporating stock-based awards as a component of employee compensation, stock-based compensation expenses will correspondingly rise. Historically, revenue growth has outpaced the growth in stock-based compensation, and as a result, the percentage of stock-based compensation relative to revenue is expected to decline. 
 
 Loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gain on disposal of property and equipment totaled 0.5 million compared to loss on disposal of property and equipment of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gain primarily resulted from proceeds related to the sale of recalled ventilators back to the manufacturer. We anticipate additional future gains from the disposal of eligible devices, as the proceeds from these disposals are expected to exceed their net book value. 
 
 Income (expense) from investments 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, income from investments totaled 0.1 million compared to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily due to a 0.1 million impairment recognized on our debt investment, reflecting an other-than-temporary impairment in fair value during the period.

 (Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts) September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Interest expense, net 
 
 For both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, net interest expense totaled 0.2 million. As a result of continued repayments on debt, we expect a reduction in quarterly net interest expense for the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for income taxes was a 1.6 million expense, compared to 1.3 million during the comparable period in 2023. The resulting decrease in the overall effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was due to the impact of discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation between periods. Our annual estimated effective tax rate for 2024 is 30.3 . 
 
 Net income 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 3.9 million, an increase of 1.0 million (or 33.8 from the comparable period in 2023. Net income as a percentage of revenue increased from 5.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Revenue 
 
 The following table summarizes our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 of Total Revenue 2023 
 of Total Revenue Change Change Revenue from rentals 
 Ventilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive 91,404 55.9 79,181 59.9 12,223 15.4 Other home medical equipment rentals 
 35,604 21.8 26,441 20.0 9,163 34.7 Revenue from sales and services

 163,562 100.0 132,269 100.0 31,293 23.7 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue totaled 163.6 million, an increase of 31.3 million (or 23.7 from the comparable period in 2023. The primary driver of this growth was our ventilator rental revenue, which increased by 12.2 million (or 15.4 due to higher patient volumes associated with strong demand for ventilation services. Additionally, rental revenue from other Home Medical Equipment (HME) increased by 9.2 million (or 34.7 due to an expanding patient base, robust demand for oxygen therapy, Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy, and percussion vest services. Equipment and supply sales grew by 2.7 million (or 13.8 largely attributable to the success of our sleep resupply program and the addition of HMP s resupply program. Furthermore, services revenue experienced an increase of 7.2 million (or 98.3 ), primarily due to the growth of healthcare staffing offerings.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 (Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts) September 30, 2024 and 2023 

While ventilator rentals continue to make up the majority of our revenue, the growth of PAP and oxygen related sales, as well as our healthcare staffing offerings, is contributing to the diversity of our overall revenue mix. As we continue to expand geographically into new territories and further expand our presence in our existing territories, we expect continued growth in our active ventilator patient base and our other respiratory offerings. 
 
 Cost of revenue and gross profit 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenue totaled 66.5 million, an increase of 14.9 million (or 28.9 from the comparable period in 2023. Gross profit percentage decreased from approximately 61.0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 59.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily due to migration of the revenue mix associated with product and service diversification. Gross profit percentage is expected to remain relatively stable in upcoming periods due to subsiding inflationary cost pressures and the positive effects associated with reimbursement rates, offset by some decreases associated with product and service diversification. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 47.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 48.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 78.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.0 million (or 21.9 from the comparable period in 2023. The improvement in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is attributable to economies of scale and improvements in operational efficiencies. The overall increase in selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to additional employee related expenses to accommodate the overall growth of the Company. Our full time employee count increased from 988 on September 30, 2023 to 1,142 on September 30, 2024, an increase of 15.6 . Employee compensation expenses increased 10.1 million (or 22 as a result of the increase in our employee headcount and increases in incentive and volume based compensation. We expect that current year selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain stable through the end of 2024 due to increased efficiencies and costs optimization efforts relative to revenue growth. 
 
 Research and development 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expense totaled 2.3 million, an increase of 0.1 million from the comparable period in 2023. As we continue to invest in research and development related projects to support our technology initiatives, we expect that associated costs will remain consistent in 2024 relative to 2023 costs, declining as a percentage of revenue. 
 
 Stock-based compensation 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation totaled 4.8 million, an increase of 10.4 from the comparable period in 2023. We anticipate that as we expand our workforce, incorporating stock-based awards as a component of employee compensation, stock-based compensation expenses will correspondingly rise. Historically, revenue growth has outpaced the growth in stock-based compensation, and as a result, the percentage of stock-based compensation relative to revenue is expected to continue declining. 
 
 Loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gain on disposal of property and equipment totaled 0.8 million compared to loss on disposal of property and equipment of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gain primarily resulted from proceeds related to the sale of recalled ventilators back to the manufacturer. We anticipate additional future gains from the disposal of eligible devices, as the proceeds from these disposals are expected to exceed their net book value. 
 
 Other expense (income), net 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expense (income), net totaled 0.3 million, an increase of 0.4 million from the comparable period in 2023. The increase in other expense (income), net is primarily due to an impairment of a litigation receivable of 0.9 million determined to be unrealizable as a result of the counterparty's bankruptcy proceedings. 
 
 Income (expense) from investments

VIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 (Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts) September 30, 2024 and 2023 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, expense from investments totaled 1.0 million compared to income from investments of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily due to impairments of 1.4 million recognized on our debt investment, reflecting an other-than-temporary impairment in fair value during the period. 
 
 Interest expense, net 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest expense totaled 0.6 million compared to interest income of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest expense is primarily due to outstanding borrowings as a result of debt issued to fund acquisitions. However, with continued debt repayments, we expect a reduction in quarterly net interest expense for the remainder of 2024. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for income taxes was a 2.9 million expense, compared to 2.5 million during the comparable period in 2023. The resulting increase in the overall effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was due to the impact of discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation between periods. Our annual estimated effective tax rate for 2024 is 30.3 . 
 
 Net income 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was 7.0 million, an increase of 0.2 million (or 3.2 from the comparable period in 2023. Net income as a percentage of revenue decreased from 5.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to non-operating fair value impairments of a debt investment and outstanding litigation funds receivable.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the Company s operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company s business that is not dependent on the impact of the Company s capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company s day-to-day operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company s operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate incentive compensation for the Company s employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company s internal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company s operational strategies. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the Company s operating performance in the same manner as management. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, certain items (mostly non-cash) are excluded from net income including depreciation and amortization of capitalized assets, net interest expense (income), stock based compensation, transaction costs, impairment of assets, and taxes. 
 
 The following table is a reconciliation of Net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a historical basis for the periods indicated:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 was 11.3 million, compared to 12.8 million at December 31, 2023. Typically, our principal source of liquidity is the collection of our patient accounts receivable. In addition to our collection of patient accounts receivable, from time to time, we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity by the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Based on our current plan of operations, we believe cash and cash equivalents, when combined with expected cash flows from operations and amounts available under our 2022 Senior Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing. The Company has also historically utilized short term financing arrangements with suppliers that could be extended over a longer term if there was a need for additional liquidity. 
 
 The Company had historically utilized Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, to submit patient claims to certain non-Medicare payors for reimbursement. UnitedHealth Group announced that on February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare s information technology systems were impacted by a cybersecurity incident. Although this incident did not impact our day-to-day operations or patient care delivery, it did cause delays in submitting patient claims to certain payors. By the end of the second quarter of 2024, the Company had replaced Change Healthcare as its clearinghouse and resumed claims submissions using alternative platforms for all claims. However, the delayed claims submissions resulted in a temporary reduction of our operating cash flow and an increase to our accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 24,102 31,928 Investing activities (21,501) (44,620) Financing activities (4,093) 5,856 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (1,492) (6,836) 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 24.1 million, resulting from net income of 7.0 million, increased by net income adjustments of 20.8 million and offset by an increase in non-cash working capital of 3.7 million. The net income adjustments primarily consisted of 19.0 million of depreciation and amortization, 4.8 million of stock-based compensation, a 3.5 million change in deferred tax asset, and an impairment loss on debt investment of 1.3 million. The primary change in non-cash working capital was an increase in net accounts receivable of 8.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of 2.4 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 31.9 million, resulting from net income of 6.8 million, increased by net income adjustments of 20.1 million and a change in net working capital of 5.1 million. The net income adjustments primarily consisted of 15.9 million of depreciation and amortization, 4.3 million of stock-based compensation, 0.8 million of distributions from equity method investments, and a 0.8 million change in deferred tax asset. The primary changes in working capital were an increase in accrued liabilities of 4.1 million and a decrease in other assets of 1.2 million, offset by an increase in net accounts receivable of 0.5 million. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.5 million. Net cash used for capital expenditures during the period was 18.5 million and consisted of 25.9 million of purchases of property and equipment, offset by 7.4 million of sales proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment. Net cash used for capital expenditures represents a 2.5 million, or 15.4 , increase year over year. Purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to medical equipment rented to our patients. Net cash used in investing activities also included 3.0 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of HomeMed.

 Net Cash Provided by (used in) Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, proceeds from the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) were 3.0 million, which was used to fund the HomeMed acquisition. Subsequent to the HomeMed acquisition, principal payments on the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility were 5.0 million. Principal payments on the 2022 Term Loan Facility (as defined below) were 0.2 million. Additionally, principal payments on acquired loans were 0.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company acquired and cancelled 142,489 common shares at a cost of 1.1 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding associated with RSUs vestings while proceeds from the exercise of options during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.4 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 5.9 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, proceeds from the 2022 Term Loan Facility (as defined below) were 5.0 million and proceeds from the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) were 8.0 million, which were used to partially fund the cash acquisition of HMP. Subsequent to the acquisition of HMP, principal payments on the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility were 4.0 million. Additionally, principal payments on acquired revolving and term loans were 3.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company acquired and cancelled 75,235 common shares at a cost of 0.6 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding associated with RSUs vestings while proceeds from the exercise of options during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.2 million. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow, which is supplemented by extended payment terms from our suppliers and amounts available under the 2022 S enior Credit Facilities. 
 
 Senior Credit Facilities 
 
 On November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement with Hancock Whitney Bank and entered into a new credit agreement (the "2022 Senior Credit Facilities") with the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent, that provides for an up to 30.0 million revolving credit facility (the "2022 Revolving Credit Facility") and an up to 30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the "2022 Term Loan Facility"), both maturing in November 2027. On May 28, 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities that (a) extends the delayed draw term loan commitment expiration date to November 29, 2025, from its initial expiration date of May 29, 2024, and (b) provides for other technical amendments. 
 
 The proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs and expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term loans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay transaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions. Outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility were 4.7 million as of September 30, 2024. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625 to 3.375 , or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625 to 2.375 . 
 
 The 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants that, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022 Senior Credit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following: 
 
 Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for any fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii) 
 Page 37 

VIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 (Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts) September 30, 2024 and 2023 

for any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material acquisition. 
 
 Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus cash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not less than 1.25:1.0. 
 
 The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at September 30, 2024. 

Use of Funds 
 
 Our principal uses of cash are funding the purchase of rental assets and other capital purchases, the repayment of debt, funding of acquisitions, operations, and other working capital requirements. Our contractual obligations primarily relate to the repayment of existing debt and contractual obligations for operating and finance leases. The following table presents our material contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of September 30, 2024: 
 Within 12 Months Beyond 12 Months Debt Obligations, including interest 
 1,172 4,898 Lease Obligations 
 1,000 2,234 Total 2,172 7,132 
 
 Except for the funding of potential acquisitions and investments, we anticipate that our operating cash flows will satisfy our material cash requirements for the 12 months after September 30, 2024. In addition to our operating cash flows, we may need to raise additional funds to support our contractual obligations and investing activities beyond such 12 month period, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders. 
 
 Leases 
 
 Leases under which we assume substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lesser of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to the asset. The associated lease liability is drawn down over the life of the lease by allocating a portion of each lease payment to the liability with the remainder being recognized as finance charges. Leases that do not transfer the risks and rewards of ownership to the Company are treated as operating leases and are expensed as incurred. 
 
 Retirement Plan 
 
 The Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for employees to which eligible employees can contribute a percentage of their pre-tax compensation. Matching employer contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled 358,000 and 316,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1,230,000 and 1,050,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Off balance sheet arrangements 
 
 The Company has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its results of operations or financial condition.

Accounting and Disclosure Matters 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 We are required to disclose critical accounting estimates which are estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 We follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, the policy noted below could be deemed to meet the SEC s definition of a critical accounting estimate. 
 
 Accounts Receivable 
 
 Accounts receivable are presented at net realizable values that reflect the consideration we expect to receive which is inclusive of adjustments for price concessions. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate, certain estimates are required in order to record revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Management s evaluation takes into consideration such factors as historical realization data, including current and historical cash collections, accounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions. 
 
 Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they may have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. It is possible that management s estimates could change, which could have an impact on operations and cash flows. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party billing arrangements, patient qualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. If the payment amount received differs from the estimated net realizable amount, an adjustment is made to the net realizable amount in the period that these payment differences are determined. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.

VIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC. September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our exposure to market risk primarily relates to fluctuations in interest rates from borrowings under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625 to 3.375 , or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625 to 2.375 . Outstanding borrowings subject to interest rate fluctuations under the 2022 Term Loan Facility were 4.7 million as of September 30, 2024. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. Based on our outstanding borrowings, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our net income. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded: 
 
 i. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (b) that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and 
 
 ii. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosures controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we may be subject to various ongoing or threatened legal actions and other proceedings, including those that arise in the ordinary course of business, which may include employment matters, breach of contract disputes, as well as governmental and regulatory matters. Please read Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and to outcomes that are not predictable with assurance and that may not be known for extended periods of time. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 6, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in that Annual Report. 
 
 We will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2024 and, as a result, we will no longer be able to avail ourselves of certain reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, subject to certain grace periods. 
 
 We are currently an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory say-on-pay votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies. 
 
 We will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2024, which the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. As a result, subject to certain grace periods, we will be required to: 
 
 engage an independent registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
 
 submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes; and 
 
 disclose a compensation discussion and analysis, including disclosure regarding certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. 
 
 We will no longer able to take advantage of cost savings associated with the JOBS Act. Furthermore, if the additional requirements applicable to non-emerging growth companies divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a non-emerging growth company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation. 
 
 As a result of our loss of emerging growth company status, it is possible that investors will find our common stock less attractive in light of the fact that we have relied on certain of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile. In addition, any failure to comply with these additional requirements in a timely manner, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.
