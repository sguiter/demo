() 

Total LIFO inventories 

The Company utilizes the LIFO method of accounting, which generally provides for the matching of current costs with current revenues. However, under the LIFO method, reductions in annual inventory balances may cause a portion of the Company s cost of sales to be based on historical costs rather than current year costs (LIFO liquidation). Reductions in interim inventory balances expected to be replenished by year-end do not result in a LIFO liquidation. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based, in part, on management s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and may differ from actual results. Since inventory levels and costs are subject to factors beyond management s control, interim results are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. There were no LIFO inventory liquidations or related impact on the cost of sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

million. The Company s intangible assets, purchased in 2018 and 2024, consist of domain names and internal use software. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, intangible assets were million and million and accumulated amortization was million and million, respectively. Intangible asset amounts were determined based on the estimated economics of the asset and are amortized over the estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over years, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received. The Company evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and considers events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that may indicate an impairment. Intangible asset amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, was million and million, respectively.

As a part of the First Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended and restated to provide for an additional Revolving B Loan (as hereinafter defined). Under the First Amendment, the Lenders agreed to provide the Company with a Revolving B Loan consisting of one or more revolving loans in a collective maximum principal amount of (Revolving B Loan Limit) throughout the term, which ends December 22, 2024 (Revolving B Loan Term). Previously, under the Credit Agreement, there was no Revolving B Loan. The First Amendment also provided that TD Bank, N.A. would serve as Syndication Agent. In conjunction with the First Amendment, on December 22, 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended and restated to refer to this loan as the Revolving A Loan. The amended and restated Credit Agreement was made an Exhibit A to the First Amendment. All of the terms of the Credit Agreement apply to the Revolving B Loan. The Notes provide the Company, in the aggregate, the ability to borrow an amount up to the Revolving A Loan Limit during the Revolving A Loan Term and Revolving B Loan Limit during the Revolving B Loan Term. The Company is not obligated to borrow any amount under the revolving loans. Within the respective loan limit, the Company may borrow, repay and reborrow at any time or from time to time while the Notes are in effect.

The Base Rate for any day is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) , (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by BOA as its prime rate, and (c) subject to certain interest rate floors. Repayment of all then outstanding principal, interest, fees and costs is due at the end of the Term. With respect to Revolving B Loans (as defined in the First Amendment), for any day, the rate per annum is a tiered pricing based upon the Consolidated Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio. The applicable rate for Revolving B Loans that are Base Rate Loans range between and and the applicable rate for Revolving B Loans that are Term SOFR/Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate range between and . Under the terms of the Security and Pledge Agreement, the Company, subject to certain permitted encumbrances, as collateral security for the above-stated loans and all other present and future indebtedness of the Company owing to the Lenders grants a continuing security interest in certain collateral described and defined in the Security and Pledge Agreement but excluding the Excluded Property (as defined in the Security and Pledge Agreement).

Compliance with Debt Covenants and Restrictions Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to certain loan compliance covenants.

For performance-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units, expense is recognized ratably over the performance and vesting period of each tranche based on management s judgment of the ultimate award that is likely to be paid out based on the achievement of the predetermined performance measures. For the employee stock purchase plan, compensation expense is recognized related to the discount on purchases. Stock-based compensation expense is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company realized million and million, respectively, of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards and recorded a corresponding benefit to income tax expense. The Company analyzes its deferred tax assets each reporting period, considering all available positive and negative evidence in determining the expected realization of those deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets primarily related to state tax credits it estimates will expire before they are realized. The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions, and, in the normal course of business, its tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future assessments by these taxing authorities, and the Company accrues a liability when it believes that it is more likely than not that benefits of tax positions will not be realized. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for all tax returns subject to examination. As of September 30, 2024, for certain tax jurisdictions tax years 2020 through 2023 remain subject to examination. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for all tax returns subject to examination.

years for Transcend decking, years for Select decking and Universal Fascia, and years for Enhance decking and Transcend, Select, Enhance and Signature railing. The warranty period for commercial use is years, excluding Signature railing and Transcend cladding, which each have a warranty period of years. The Company further warrants that Trex Transcend, Trex Enhance and Trex Select decking and cladding and Universal Fascia products will not fade in color from light and weathering exposure more than a certain amount and will be resistant to permanent staining from food and beverage substances or mold and mildew, provided the stain is cleaned within seven days of appearance, for the warranty period referred to above. If there is a breach of such warranties, the Company has an obligation either to replace the defective product or refund the purchase price. Products sold prior to January 1, 2023: The warranty period is years for residential use and years for commercial use. With respect to Trex Signature railing, the warranty period is years for both residential and commercial use. The Company further warrants that Trex Transcend, Trex Enhance, Trex Select and Universal Fascia products will not fade in color more than a certain amount and will be resistant to permanent staining from food substances or mold, provided the stain is cleaned within seven days of appearance, for the warranty period referred to above. If there is a breach of such warranties, the Company has an obligation either to replace the defective product or refund the purchase price. The Company maintains a warranty reserve for the settlement of its product warranty claims. The Company accrues for the estimated cost of product warranty claims at the time revenue is recognized based on such factors as historical claims experience and estimated future claims. Management reviews and adjusts these estimates, if necessary, based on the differences between actual experience and historical estimates. Additionally, the Company accrues for warranty costs associated with occasional or unanticipated product quality issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, as necessary. The Company continues to receive and settle claims for decking products manufactured at its Nevada facility prior to 2007 that exhibit surface flaking and maintains a warranty reserve to provide for the settlement of these claims. Estimating the warranty reserve for surface flaking claims requires management to estimate (1) the number of claims to be settled with payment and (2) the average cost to settle each claim. To estimate the number of claims to be settled with payment, the Company utilizes actuarial techniques to determine a reasonable possible range of claims to be received and the percentage of those claims that will ultimately require payment (collectively, elements). Estimates for these elements are quantified using a range of assumptions derived from claim count history and the identification of factors influencing the claim counts to determine its best estimate of future claims for which to record a related liability. The cost per claim varies due to a number of factors, including the size of affected decks, the availability and type of replacement material used, the cost of production of replacement material and the method of claim settlement. The Company monitors surface flaking claims activity each quarter for indications that its estimates require revision. Typically, a majority of surface flaking claims received in a year are received during the summer outdoor season, which spans the second and third quarters. It has been the Company s practice to utilize the actuarial techniques discussed above during the third quarter, after a significant portion of all claims has been received for the fiscal year and variances to annual claims expectations are more meaningful. The number of incoming claims received in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was lower than the number of claims received in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, but higher than the Company s expectations for 2024. Average cost per claim experienced in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was lower than that experienced in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and significantly lower than the Company s expectations for 2024. After evaluating trends in incoming claims and closures in its actuarial analysis and combining these factors with future cost estimates, the Company recorded a reduction of million to its 

13 

change in the expected number of remaining claims to be settled with payment or the expected cost to settle claims may result in approximately a million change in the surface flaking warranty reserve.

Legal Matters The Company has lawsuits, as well as other claims, pending against it which are ordinary routine litigation and claims incidental to the business. Management has evaluated the merits of these lawsuits and claims and believes that their ultimate resolution will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or competitive position. Arkansas Facility In October 2021, the Company announced plans to add a third U.S.-based Trex manufacturing facility located in Little Rock, Arkansas, that will sit on approximately acres of land. The development approach for the new campus will be modular and calibrated to demand trends for Trex outdoor living products. Construction began on the new facility in 2022. The Company anticipates spending approximately million on the facility, of which approximately million has already been disbursed. Construction for the new facility will be funded primarily through the Company s ongoing cash generation or its line of credit.

 OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS Trex is the world s largest manufacturer of high-performance composite decking and residential railing products, which are marketed under the brand name Trex and manufactured in the United States. With more than 30 years of product experience, we offer a comprehensive set of aesthetically appealing and durable, low-maintenance product offerings in the decking, residential railing, fencing and outdoor lighting categories. A majority of the products are eco-friendly and leverage recycled and reclaimed materials to the extent possible. Trex decking is made in a proprietary process that combines reclaimed wood fibers and recycled polyethylene film, making Trex one of the largest recyclers of plastic film in North America. In addition to resisting fading and surface staining, Trex products require no sanding and sealing, resist moisture damage, provide a splinter-free surface and do not require chemical treatment against rot or insect infestation. Combined, these aspects yield significant aesthetic advantages and lower maintenance than wood decking and railing and ultimately render Trex products less costly than wood over the life of the deck. Special characteristics (including resistance to splitting, the ability to bend, and ease and consistency of machining and finishing) facilitate installation, 

 15 

reduce contractor call-backs and afford consumers a wide range of design options. Trex products are sold to distributors and home centers for final resale primarily to the residential market. Trex offers the following products: 

Decking and Accessories 
 Our principal decking products are Trex Signature , Trex Transcend Lineage , Trex Transcend , Trex Select , and Trex Enhance . In addition, our Trex Transcend decking product can also be used as cladding. Our high-performance, low-maintenance, eco-friendly composite decking products are comprised of a blend of 95 percent reclaimed wood fibers and recycled polyethylene film and feature a protective polymer shell for enhanced protection against fading, staining, mold and scratching. Trex Signature decking offers realistic woodgrain aesthetics that raises the bar for beauty, performance and sustainability and is available in two luxurious hues inspired by stunning natural settings. Trex Transcend Lineage is the next generation of design and performance in composite decking and is available in four luxurious, on-trend hues inspired by some of the most picturesque locales in the United States. Our Trex Transcend decking provides elevated aesthetics paired with the highest level of performance and is available in eight multi-tonal monochromatic classical earth tones and premium tropical colors. Trex Select decking offers the perfect pairing of price and minimal maintenance and is available in five nature-inspired earth tone colors. Our Trex Enhance boards pair the beauty of authentic wood-grain appearance with the durability of composite with minimal maintenance and the affordability of wood and is available in natural and basic colors. We also offer accessories to our decking products. The Trex Hideaway Fastener Collection includes solutions for every composite deck fastening and finishing need, and includes color-matched screws and plugs and specially engineered bits, depth setters, and clips. The collection is designed to make installation easier and more efficient while delivering a clean, cohesive aesthetic, and is fully compatible with all Trex decking products. Trex DeckLighting , an outdoor lighting system, is a line of energy-efficient LED dimmable deck lighting designed to use 75 less energy compared to incandescent lighting. It can be installed into the railing, stair risers or the deck itself. The line includes a post cap light, deck rail light, riser light, a soffit light and a recessed deck light. Pre-assembled stair panels that allow for easier installation are designed to save time on the jobsite. 

Railing 
 Our railing products are Trex Transcend Railing, Trex Select Railing, and Trex Signature aluminum railing. Our high-performance composite and aluminum deck railing kits and systems are sustainably manufactured, easy to install and durable. Trex railing systems are built with the same durability as Trex decking and won t rot, warp, peel or splinter and resist fading and corrosion. Trex Transcend Railing, made from approximately 40 percent recycled content, is available in the colors of Trex Transcend decking and finishes that make it appropriate for use with Trex decking products as well as other decking materials, which we believe enhances the sales prospects of our railing products. Trex Select Railing, made from approximately 40 percent recycled content, is offered in a white finish and is ideal for consumers who desire a simple clean finished look for their deck. Trex Signature aluminum railing, made from a minimum of 40 percent recycled content, is available in three colors and designed for consumers who want a sleek, contemporary look.

Capital expenditures . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our capital expenditures were 151.5 million primarily related to 108.1 million for the Arkansas manufacturing facility, 16.0 million in capacity expansion in our existing facilities and safety, environmental and general support, and 12.0 million in cost reduction initiatives. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General. Our results of operations are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, cost of raw materials, inflation, interest rates, consumer spending and preferences, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, economic conditions, and any adverse effects from global health pandemics and geopolitical conflicts. Net Sales . Net sales consist of sales, net of discounts. The level of net sales is principally affected by sales volume and the prices paid for Trex products. Trex operating results have historically varied from quarter to quarter. Seasonal, erratic or prolonged adverse weather conditions in certain geographic regions reduce the level of home and commercial improvement and residential and commercial construction and can shift demand for our products to a later period. As part of our normal business practice and consistent with industry practice, we have historically provided our distributors and dealers of our Trex products incentives to build inventory levels before the start of the prime deck-building season to ensure adequate availability of our product to meet anticipated seasonal consumer demand and to enable production planning. These incentives include payment discounts, favorable payment terms, price discounts, or volume rebates on specified products and other incentives based on increases in purchases as part of specific promotional programs. The timing of our incentive programs can significantly impact sales, receivables and inventory levels during the offering period. Gross Profit. Gross profit represents the difference between net sales and cost of sales. Cost of sales consists of raw material costs, direct labor costs, manufacturing costs, subcontract costs and freight. Raw material costs generally include the costs to purchase and transport reclaimed wood fiber, reclaimed polyethylene, pigmentation for coloring our products, and commodities used in the production of railing and staging. Direct labor costs include wages and benefits of personnel engaged in the manufacturing process. Manufacturing costs consist of costs of depreciation, utilities, maintenance supplies and repairs, indirect labor, including wages and benefits, and warehouse and equipment rental activities. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The largest component of selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel related costs, which includes salaries, commissions, incentive compensation, and benefits of personnel engaged in sales and marketing, accounting, information technology, corporate operations, research and development, and other business functions. Another component of selling, general and administrative expenses is branding and other sales and marketing costs, which are used to build brand awareness. These costs consist primarily of advertising, merchandising, and other promotional costs. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees, office occupancy costs attributable to the business functions previously referenced, and consumer relations expenses. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses may vary from quarter to quarter due, in part, to the seasonality of our business. Below is the discussion and analysis of our operating results and material changes in our operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (2024 quarter) compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 (2023 quarter), and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (2024 nine-month period) compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (2023 nine-month period).

 Net sales decreased by 70.1 million, or 23.1 , in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. The decrease was driven by volume, predominantly in the entry level product category, as consumers reduce their discretionary spending during uncertain economic times and our channel partners normalize their inventories related to the consumer behaviors.

Excluding the surface flaking benefit, gross margin in the 2024 quarter was 39.4 compared to 41.8 in the 2023 quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume, offset partially by favorable impacts from our continuous improvement programs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

9.4 

Total net sales increased by 84.7 million, or 9.4 , in the 2024 nine-month period compared to the 2023 nine-month period. The increase was substantially all due to an increase in volume, driven primarily by changes to our early-buy program running January to March, rather than our historical December to March time frame. We estimate this change accounted for approximately 75 million, or 8.3 , of the growth in the 2024 nine month period. __________________________ 1 EBITDA represents net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We have included data with respect to EBITDA because management believes it facilitates performance comparison between the Company and its competitors, and management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments using several measures, including EBITDA. Management considers EBITDA to be an important supplemental indicator of our core operating performance because it eliminates interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization charges to net income or loss. In relation to competitors, EBITDA eliminates differences among companies in capitalization and tax structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets. For these reasons, management believes that EBITDA provides important information regarding the operating performance of the Company and its reportable segments. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for our GAAP results.

The increase in EBITDA was driven primarily by higher net sales and gross profit. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We finance operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, operating leases and normal trade credit terms from operating activities. At September 30, 2024, we had 12.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. S ources and Uses of Cash.

The 135.8 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to an increase in inventories, as a result of increased production in the 2024 nine-month period compared to the 2023 nine-month period. Investing Activities Capital expenditures in the 2024 nine-month period were 151.5 million primarily related to 108.1 million for the Arkansas manufacturing facility, 16.0 million in capacity expansion in our existing facilities and safety, environmental and general support, and 12.0 million in cost reduction initiatives. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in the 2024 nine-month period consisted primarily of net borrowings under our line of credit. Stock Repurchase Program. On February 16, 2018, the Trex Board of Directors adopted a stock repurchase program of up to 11.6 million shares of its outstanding common stock (Stock Repurchase Program). As of March 31, 2023, the Company had repurchased 10.1 million shares under the Stock Repurchase Program. On May 4, 2023, the Trex Board of Directors adopted a new stock repurchase program of up to 10.8 million shares of its outstanding common stock, and terminated the existing Stock Repurchase Program. This repurchase program has no set expiration date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 822,400 shares of its common stock under the 2023 Stock Repurchase Program. Revolving Credit Facility Indebtedness prior to October 10, 2024. On May 18, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with certain lending parties thereto (Lenders) to amend and restate the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 5, 2019. Under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders agreed to provide the Company with one or more Revolving Loans in a collective maximum principal amount of 400,000,000 (Loan Limit) throughout the term, which ends May 18, 2027 (Term). Included within the Loan Limit are sublimits for a Letter of Credit facility in an amount not to exceed 60,000,000; and Swing Line Loans in an 

 22 

aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed 20,000,000. The Revolving Loans, the Letter of Credit facility and the Swing Line Loans are for the purpose of raising working capital and supporting general business operations. On December 22, 2022, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (First Amendment). As a part of the First Amendment, the Credit Agreement was amended and restated to provide for an additional Revolving B Loan (as hereinafter defined). Under the First Amendment, the Lenders agreed to provide the Company with a Revolving B Loan consisting of one or more revolving loans in a collective maximum principal amount of 150,000,000 (Revolving B Loan Limit) throughout the term, which ends December 22, 2024 (Revolving B Loan Term). Previously, under the Credit Agreement, there was no Revolving B Loan. The First Amendment also provided that TD Bank, N.A. would serve as Syndication Agent. In conjunction with the First Amendment, on December 22, 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended and restated to refer to this loan as the Revolving A Loan. The amended and restated Credit Agreement was made an Exhibit A to the First Amendment. All of the terms of the Credit Agreement apply to the Revolving B Loan. The Notes provide the Company, in the aggregate, the ability to borrow an amount up to the Revolving A Loan Limit during the Revolving A Loan Term and Revolving B Loan Limit during the Revolving B Loan Term. The Company is not obligated to borrow any amount under the revolving loans. Within the respective loan limit, the Company may borrow, repay and reborrow at any time or from time to time while the Notes are in effect. Base Rate Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) under the Revolving A Loan and the Swing Line Loans accrue interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and Term SOFR Loans for the Revolving Loans accrue interest at the rate per annum equal to the sum of Term SOFR for such interest period plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Base Rate for any day is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 , (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by BOA as its prime rate, and (c) the Term SOFR plus 1.0 subject to certain interest rate floors. Repayment of all then outstanding principal, interest, fees and costs is due at the end of the Term. With respect to Revolving B Loans (as defined in the First Amendment), for any day, the rate per annum is a tiered pricing based upon the Consolidated Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio. The applicable rate for Revolving B Loans that are Base Rate Loans range between 1.20 and 2.15 and the applicable rate for Revolving B Loans that are Term SOFR/Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate range between 0.20 and 1.15 . Under the terms of the Security and Pledge Agreement, the Company, subject to certain permitted encumbrances, as collateral security for the above-stated loans and all other present and future indebtedness of the Company owing to the Lenders grants a continuing security interest in certain collateral described and defined in the Security and Pledge Agreement but excluding the Excluded Property (as defined in the Security and Pledge Agreement). Indebtedness on and after October 10, 2024. On October 10, 2024, Trex entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (Second Amendment) with certain lending parties thereto (Lenders) to amend that Credit Agreement dated as of May 18, 2022, as amended by that certain First Amendment dated as of December 22, 2022. The Second Amendment provides us with Revolving A Loans in the maximum principal amount of 400,000,000 (Revolving A Loans), Revolving B Loans in the maximum principal amount of 150,000,000 (Revolving B Loans), and Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Second Amendment extends the maturity date of the Revolving B Loans from December 22, 2024 to December 22, 2026. Base Rate Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) under the Revolving A Loan and the Swing Line Loans accrue interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and Term SOFR Loans for the Revolving Loans accrue interest at the rate per annum equal to the sum of Term SOFR for such interest period plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Base Rate for any day is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 , (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by BOA as its prime rate, and (c) the Term SOFR plus 1.0 subject to certain interest rate floors. Repayment of all then outstanding principal, interest, fees and costs is due at the end of the Term (as defined in the Credit Agreement). With respect to Revolving B Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement), for any day, the rate per annum is a tiered pricing based upon the Consolidated Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio. The applicable rate for Revolving B Loans that are Base Rate Loans range between 0.20 and 1.15 . and the applicable rate for Revolving B Loans that are Term SOFR/Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate range between 1.20 and 2.15 .

At September 30, 2024, we had 70 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and borrowing capacity under the facility of 480 million. Compliance with Debt Covenants. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to certain loan compliance covenants. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. Failure to comply with the financial covenants could be considered a default of repayment obligations and, among other remedies, could accelerate payment of any amounts outstanding. We believe that cash on hand, cash from operations and borrowings expected to be available under our revolving credit facilities will provide sufficient funds to fund planned capital expenditures, make scheduled principal and interest payments, fund warranty payments, and meet other cash requirements. We currently expect to fund future capital expenditures from operations and financing activities. The actual amount and timing of future capital requirements may differ materially from our estimate depending on the demand for Trex products and new market developments and opportunities. Capital Requirements. In October 2021, we announced plans to add a third U.S.-based Trex manufacturing facility located in Little Rock, Arkansas. The new campus will sit on approximately 300 acres of land and will address increased demand for Trex outdoor living products. The development approach for the new campus will be modular and calibrated to demand trends for Trex outdoor living products. Construction began on the new facility in 2022. The Company anticipates spending approximately 550 million on the facility, of which approximately 340 million has already been disbursed. Construction for the new facility will be funded primarily through the Company s ongoing cash generation or its line of credit. Our capital expenditure guidance for 2024 is 210 million to 230 million. In addition to the construction of the Arkansas facility, our capital allocation priorities for 2024 include expenditures for internal growth opportunities, manufacturing cost reductions, upgrading equipment and support systems, and acquisitions which fit our long-term growth strategy as we continue to evaluate opportunities that would be a good strategic fit for Trex, and return of capital to shareholders. Inventory in Distribution Channels. We sell our decking and railing products through a tiered distribution system. We have over 50 distributors worldwide and two national retail merchandisers to which we sell our products. The distributors in turn sell the products to dealers and retail locations who in turn sell the products to end users. Significant increases in inventory levels in the distribution channel without a corresponding change in end-use demand could have an adverse effect on future sales. Product Warranty. We warrant that for the applicable warranty period our products, when properly installed, used and maintained, will be free from material defects in workmanship and materials and our decking, cladding, fascia and railing products will not split, splinter, rot or suffer structural damage from termites or fungal decay. Products sold on or after January 1, 2023: The warranty period for residential use is 50 years for Transcend decking, 35 years for Select decking and Universal Fascia, and 25 years for Enhance decking and Transcend, Select, Enhance and Signature railing. The warranty period for commercial use is 10 years, excluding Signature railing and Transcend cladding, which each have a warranty period of 25 years. We further warrant that Trex Transcend, Trex Enhance and Trex Select decking and cladding and Universal Fascia products will not fade in color from light and weathering exposure more than a certain amount and will be resistant to permanent staining from food and beverage substances or mold and mildew, provided the stain is cleaned within seven days of appearance, for the warranty period referred to above. If there is a breach of such warranties, we have an obligation either to replace the defective product or refund the purchase price. Products sold prior to January 1, 2023: The warranty period is 25 years for residential use and 10 years for commercial use. With respect to Trex Signature railing, the warranty period is 25 years for both residential and commercial use. We further warrant that Trex Transcend, Trex Enhance, Trex Select and Universal Fascia products will not fade in color more than a certain amount and will be resistant to permanent staining from food substances or mold, provided the stain is cleaned within seven days of appearance, for the warranty period referred to above. If there is a breach of such warranties, we have an obligation either to replace the defective product or refund the purchase price. We maintain a warranty reserve for the settlement of our product warranty claims. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranty claims at the time revenue is recognized based on such factors as historical claims experience and estimated future claims. We review and adjust these estimates, if necessary, based on the differences between actual experience and historical estimates. Additionally, we accrue for warranty costs associated with occasional or unanticipated product quality issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We continue to receive and settle claims for products manufactured at our Nevada facility prior to 2007 that exhibit surface flaking and maintain a warranty reserve to provide for the settlement of these claims. Estimating the warranty reserve for surface 

 24 

flaking claims requires management to estimate (1) the number of claims to be settled with payment and (2) the average cost to settle each claim. To estimate the number of surface flaking claims to be settled with payment, we utilize actuarial techniques to quantify both the expected number of claims to be received and the percentage of those claims that will ultimately require payment (collectively, elements). Estimates for these elements are quantified using a range of assumptions derived from claim count history and the identification of factors influencing the claim counts. The cost per claim varies due to a number of factors, including the size of affected decks, the availability and type of replacement material used, the cost of production of replacement material and the method of claim settlement. We monitor surface flaking claims activity each quarter for indications that our estimates require revision. Typically, a majority of surface flaking claims received in a year are received during the summer outdoor season, which spans the second and third quarters. It has been our practice to utilize the actuarial techniques discussed above during the third quarter, after a significant portion of all claims has been received for the fiscal year and variances to annual claims expectations are more meaningful. The number of incoming claims received in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was lower than the number of claims received in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, but higher than the Company s expectations for 2024. Average cost per claim experienced in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was lower than that experienced in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and significantly lower than the Company s expectations for 2024. After evaluating trends in incoming claims and closures in its actuarial analysis and combining these factors with future cost estimates, the Company recorded a reduction of 1.1 million to its warranty reserve for the future settlement of Surface Flaking claims. The Company believes the reserve at September 30, 2024 is sufficient to cover future surface flaking obligations. Our analysis is based on currently known facts and a number of assumptions, as discussed above, and current expectations. Projecting future events such as the number of claims to be received, the number of claims that will require payment and the average cost of claims could cause the actual warranty liabilities to be higher or lower than those projected, which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We estimate that the annual number of claims received will continue to decline over time and that the average cost per claim will increase slightly, primarily due to inflation. If the level of claims received or average cost per claim differs materially from expectations, it could result in additional increases or decreases to the warranty reserve and a decrease or increase in earnings and cash flows in future periods. We estimate that a 10 change in the expected number of remaining claims to be settled with payment or the expected cost to settle claims may result in approximately a 0.7 million change in the surface flaking warranty reserve. The following table details surface flaking claims activity related to our warranty:

 Seasonality . The operating results for Trex have historically varied from quarter to quarter. Seasonal, erratic or prolonged adverse weather conditions in certain geographic regions may reduce the level of home improvement and construction activity and can shift demand for its products to a later period. As part of its normal business practice and consistent with industry practice, Trex has historically offered incentive programs to its distributors and dealers to build inventory levels before the start of the prime deck-building season in order to ensure adequate availability of its product to meet anticipated seasonal consumer demand. The seasonal effects are often offset by the positive effect of the incentive programs. Item 3. Quantitative a nd Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For information regarding our exposure to certain market risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in Part II, Item 7A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

TREX COMPANY, INC. 2023 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT 

SARs Vesting 
 The SARS are only exercisable before the Last Date to Exercise (noted on the cover sheet) and then only with respect to the vested portion of the SARs. Subject to the preceding sentence, you may exercise the SARs, in whole or in part, by following the procedures set forth in the Plan and below in this Agreement. For the purpose of this Agreement, Service means service as an employee of the Company or any Affiliate or service as Service Provider. Your right to exercise the SARs vests as to thirty three and one-third percent (33 1/3 of the total number of SARs on each anniversary of the grant, as shown on the cover sheet, provided that you then continue in Service on each such vesting date. The resulting aggregate number of vested SARs will be rounded to the nearest whole number, and you may not vest in more than the number of SARs shown on the cover sheet. Except as otherwise provided herein, no SARs will vest after your Service has terminated for any reason. 

Forfeiture; Early Vesting; Exercise 
 Upon the termination of your Services, other than by reason of your death, Disability, Retirement, or termination by the Company without Cause or at your election with Good Reason, any SARs that have not vested hereunder shall immediately be deemed forfeited and your vested SARs will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the 90th day after your termination date (or, if such 90th day is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, at the close of business on the next preceding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday); but in any event no later than the Last Date to Exercise. In the event of the termination of your Services because of your death, Disability, or Retirement, any SARs that have not vested hereunder shall immediately become fully vested and will expire at the close of business on the Last Date to Exercise. Up to the Last Date to Exercise, your or your estate or heirs may exercise your SARs. As a condition to such SARs vesting upon your termination of employment by the Company without Cause or at your election with Good Reason , you must first execute a written release and agreement provided by the Company and not revoke such release and agreement within the time permitted therein for such revocation. 

2 

In the event of the termination of your Services by the Company without Cause or at your election with Good Reason , or in the event of a Change in Control , any SARs that have not vested hereunder shall immediately become fully vested and will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the 90th day after your termination date or Change in Control, whichever is applicable, (or, if such 90th day is a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, at the close of business on the next preceding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday); but in any event no later than the Last Date to Exercise. Cause means one of the following reasons for which your employment with the Company is terminated: (1) Your willful or grossly negligent misconduct that is injurious to the Company or that violates Company policy; (2) Your embezzlement or misappropriation of funds or property of the Company; (3) Your conviction of a felony or the entrance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony; (4) Your conviction of any crime involving fraud, dishonesty, moral turpitude or breach of trust or the entrance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to such a crime; or (5) Your willful failure or refusal by you to devote your full business time (other than on account of disability or approved leave) and attention to the performance of your duties and responsibilities if such breach has not been cured within 15 days after written notice thereof is given to you by the Board of Directors. Good Reason shall exist upon: (1) a material and adverse change in your status or position(s) as an officer or management employee of the Company, including, without limitation, any adverse change in your status or position as an employee of the Company as a result of a material diminution in your duties or responsibilities (other than, if applicable, any such change directly attributable to the fact that the Company is no longer publicly owned) or the assignment to you of any duties or responsibilities which are materially inconsistent with such status or position(s) (other than any isolated and inadvertent failure by the Company that is cured promptly upon your giving notice), or any removal of you from or any failure to reappoint or reelect you to such position(s) (except in connection with your termination other than for Good Reason); (2) a 10 or greater reduction in your aggregate base salary and targeted bonus, other than any such reduction proportionately consistent with a general reduction of pay across the executive staff as a group, as an economic or strategic measure due to poor financial performance by the Company; (3) the failure by the Company to continue in effect any material employee benefit plan (excluding any equity compensation plan) in which you are participating (or plans providing you with similar benefits that are not materially reduced in the aggregate) other than as a result of the normal expiration of any such plan in accordance with its terms; or the taking of any action, or the failure to act, by the Company or any successor which would adversely 

3 

affect your continued participation in any of such plans on at least as favorable a basis to you or which would materially reduce your benefits under any of such plans; (4) Company s requiring you to be based at an office that is both more than 50 miles from where your office is located and further from your then current residence; or (5) a material breach by the Company of any agreement with you; provided, however, that if any of the conditions exists, you must provide written notice to the Company no more than ninety (90) calendar days following the initial existence of the condition and your intention to terminate your employment for Good Reason. Upon such notice, the Company shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar days during which it may remedy the condition and, if the Company fails to remedy such condition, you terminate your Services within ninety (90) calendar days following such failure. Change in Control shall have the meaning given to such term in the Change in Control Severance Agreement between you and the Company, provided that in all cases such Change in Control constitutes a change in control event within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision herein to the contrary, SARs shall also vest according to the terms and conditions, if so provided, in any separate agreement between you and the Company, including but not limited to any Employment Agreement, Severance Agreement or Change in Control Severance Agreement. 

Notice of Exercise 
 When you wish to exercise this award of SARs, you must notify the Company by filing the proper Notice of Exercise form at the address given on the form. All exercises must take place before, and your SARs will expire on, the Last Date to Exercise (shown on the cover sheet), or such earlier date following termination of your service as otherwise provided herein or a Change in Control. Your notice must specify how many SARs you wish to exercise. Your notice must also specify how the shares of Stock received on the exercise of your SARs should be registered (in your name only or in your and your spouse s names as joint tenants with right of survivorship). The notice will be effective when it is received by the Company. If someone else wants to exercise the SARs after your death, that person must prove to the Company s satisfaction that he or she is entitled to do so. 

Payment for SARs 
 Upon your exercise of the SARs, the Company will pay you in shares of Stock an amount equal to the positive difference (if any) between the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the exercise date and the SAR Grant 

4 

Price, multiplied by the number of SARs being exercised. Any fractional shares of Stock will be paid to you in cash. 

Withholding Taxes 
 You agree, as a condition of this grant, that you will make acceptable arrangements to pay any withholding or other taxes that may be due as a result of the exercise of SARs. In the event that the Company determines that any federal, state, local or foreign tax or withholding payment is required relating to the exercise of SARs, the Company shall have the right to require such payments from you, withhold shares that would otherwise have been issued to you under this Agreement or withhold such amounts from other payments due to you from the Company or any Affiliate. 

Retention Rights 
 This Agreement does not give you the right to be retained by the Company in any capacity. The Company reserves the right to terminate your Service at any time and for any reason. 

Shareholder Rights 
 You, or your estate or heirs, have no rights as a shareholder of the Company until a certificate for shares of Stock received pursuant to the exercise of your SARS has been issued (or an appropriate book entry has been made). No adjustments are made for dividends or other rights if the applicable record date occurs before your stock certificate is issued (or an appropriate book entry has been made), except as described in the Plan. 

Adjustments 
 In the event of a stock split, a stock dividend or a similar change in the Stock, the number of SARs and the SAR Grant Price per share shall be adjusted (and rounded down to the nearest whole number) if required pursuant to the Plan. Your SARs shall be subject to the terms of the agreement of merger, liquidation or reorganization in the event the Company is subject to such corporate activity. 

Applicable Law 
 This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of Delaware, other than any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction.

TREX COMPANY, INC. 2023 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT TIME-BASED VESTING 

Restricted Stock Units 
 This grant is an award of restricted stock units in the number of units set forth on the cover sheet, and subject to the vesting and other conditions described below (the RSUs ). Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. Your RSUs may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated, whether by operation of law or otherwise, nor may the RSUs be made subject to execution, attachment or similar process. 

Vesting 
 Your RSUs will vest as to thirty three and one-third percent (33 1/3 of the total number of RSUs covered by this grant, on each anniversary of the grant, as shown on the cover sheet; provided, that you continue to provide services to the Company or a Subsidiary as an employee or a Service Provider Services on each such vesting date. The resulting aggregate number of vested RSUs will be rounded to the nearest whole number, and you may not vest in more than the number of RSUs covered by this grant. 

Delivery 
 As soon as practicable following the vesting of the RSUs hereunder, the Company will issue to you a share certificate for the shares of Stock to which such vested RSUs relate. In the alternative, the Company may use the book-entry method of share recordation to indicate your share ownership. You will have no further rights with regard to a RSU once the share of Stock related to such RSU has been issued. 

Early Vesting 
 Upon the termination of your Services, other than by reason of your death, Disability, Retirement, or termination by the Company without Cause or at your election with Good Reason, any RSUs that have not vested hereunder shall immediately be deemed forfeited. In the event of the termination of your Services because of your death, Disability, Retirement or termination by the Company without Cause or at your election with Good Reason , any RSUs that have not vested hereunder shall immediately become fully vested. (For purposes of clarification, these vesting provisions apply notwithstanding any different vesting provision in the Plan.) As a condition to such RSUs vesting upon your termination of employment by the Company without Cause or at your election with Good Reason , you must first execute a written release and agreement provided by the Company and not revoke such release and agreement within the time permitted therein for such revocation. 

- 2 - 

Cause means one of the following reasons for which your employment with the Company is terminated: (1) Your willful or grossly negligent misconduct that is injurious to the Company or violates Company policy; (2) Your embezzlement or misappropriation of funds or property of the Company; (3) Your conviction of a felony or the entrance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony; (4) Your conviction of any crime involving fraud, dishonesty, moral turpitude or breach of trust or the entrance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to such a crime; or (5) Your willful failure or refusal by you to devote your full business time (other than on account of disability or approved leave) and attention to the performance of your duties and responsibilities if such breach has not been cured within 15 days after written notice thereof is given to you by the Board of Directors. Good Reason shall exist upon: (1) a material and adverse change in your status or position(s) as an officer or management employee of the Company, including, without limitation, any adverse change in your status or position as an employee of the Company as a result of a material diminution in your duties or responsibilities (other than, if applicable, any such change directly attributable to the fact that the Company is no longer publicly owned) or the assignment to you of any duties or responsibilities which are materially inconsistent with such status or position(s) (other than any isolated and inadvertent failure by the Company that is cured promptly upon your giving notice), or any removal of you from or any failure to reappoint or reelect you to such position(s) (except in connection with your termination other than for Good Reason); (2) a 10 or greater reduction in your aggregate base salary and targeted bonus, other than any such reduction proportionately consistent with a general reduction of pay across the executive staff as a group, as an economic or strategic measure due to poor financial performance by the Company; (3) the failure by the Company to continue in effect any material employee benefit plan (excluding any equity compensation plan) in which you are participating (or plans providing you with similar benefits that are not materially reduced in the aggregate) other than as a result of the normal expiration of any such plan in accordance with its terms; or the taking of any action, or the failure to act, by the Company or any successor which would adversely affect your continued participation in any of such plans on at least as favorable a basis to you or which would materially reduce your benefits under any of such plans; (4) Company s requiring you to be based at an office that is both more than 50 miles from where your office is located and further from your then current residence; or (5) a material breach by the Company of any agreement with you; provided, however, that if any of the conditions exists, you must provide written notice to the Company no more than ninety (90) calendar days following the initial existence of the condition and your intention to terminate your employment for Good Reason. Upon such notice, the Company shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar days during which it may remedy the condition and, if the Company fails to 

- 3 - 

remedy such condition, you terminate your Services within ninety (90) calendar days following such failure. In the event of a Change in Control, any RSUs that have not vested hereunder shall immediately become fully vested. Change in Control shall have the meaning given to such term in the Change in Control Severance Agreement between you and the Company, provided that in all cases such Change in Control constitutes a change in control event within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision herein to the contrary, RSUs shall also vest according to the terms and conditions, if so provided, in any separate agreement between you and the Company, including but not limited to any Employment Agreement, Severance Agreement or Change in Control Severance Agreement. 

Withholding Taxes 
 You agree, as a condition of this grant, that you will make acceptable arrangements to pay any withholding or other taxes that may be due as a result of vesting in RSUs (including any employment taxes that may become payable if you become eligible for Retirement prior to the end of the performance period for the RSUs) or delivery of Stock acquired under this grant. In the event that the Company determines that any federal, state, local or foreign tax or withholding payment is required relating to the vesting in RSUs or delivery of shares arising from this grant, the Company shall have the right to require such payments from you, withhold shares that would otherwise have been issued to you under this Agreement or withhold such amounts from other payments due to you from the Company or any Affiliate.

Shareholder Rights

Adjustments

Your RSUs shall be subject to the terms of the agreement of merger, liquidation or reorganization in the event the Company is subject to such corporate activity. 

- 4 - 

Applicable Law 
 This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of Delaware, other than any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. 

Section 409A 
 To the extent applicable, the RSUs granted under this Agreement are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively, Section 409A ). The provisions of this paragraph shall qualify and supersede all other provisions of this Agreement and the Plan as necessary to fulfill the foregoing intent. In furtherance of the foregoing, any RSUs that accelerate and vest upon a termination of Services hereunder and that are otherwise subject to Section 409A shall accelerate and vest upon such a termination of Services solely if such termination constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. Additionally, if at the time of any such separation from service you are entitled to accelerated vesting of any RSUs granted hereunder and are also a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A and as determined by the Company) and such RSUs granted hereunder may not be settled without subjecting you to additional tax, interest and/or penalties under Section 409A, then such RSUs shall accelerate and vest upon your separation from service but shall not settle until the earlier of (i) your death or (ii) the first business day of the seventh (7th) month immediately following your separation from service.
