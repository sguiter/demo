The increase was primarily due to stock-based compensation of approximately 3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024; there was no such expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net Loss . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net loss was 4,195,265 and 1,392,683, respectively. The increase in net loss was primarily due to higher operating expenses as discussed above. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we have yet to achieve profitable operations, and while we hope to achieve profitable operations in the future, if not, we may need to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to sustain operations and to ultimately achieve viable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities, as well as our ability to raise capital. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if we will be able to become profitable and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and/or manage operating expenses, we may not be able to achieve profitability. Our ability to continue in existence is dependent on our ability to achieve profitable operations. To continue operations for the next 12 months, we will have a cash need of approximately 1,000,000. Should we not be able to fulfill our cash needs through the increase of revenue, we will need to raise money through outside investors through convertible notes, debt or similar instrument(s). Our plans to pay off current liabilities through sales and increasing revenue through sales of our services and or products, or through financing activities as mentioned above, although there is no guarantee that we will ultimately do so. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 710,699 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of our net loss of 4,195,265, change in fair value of derivative liabilities of 41,859, and gain on debt extinguishment of 102,579, offset by shares issued for services provided of 3,033,400 amortization of debt discount of 292,470, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 208,781. Net cash used in operating activities was 591,749 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of our net loss of 1,392,683, offset by shares issued for services provided of 218,002, financing costs of 225,952, change in fair value of derivative liabilities of 42,372, 65,000 for the write-off of investments, amortization of debt discount of 31,482, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 218,126. Investing Activities There was no cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, totaled 86,500. The Company made preliminary investments of 50,000 and 15,000 in two separate operating companies which were then subsequently written-off. The 21,500 in 2024 related to additional funds advanced to one of the target companies for which the Company has Notes Receivable which is has now been determined to be uncollectible. 16 Table of Contents Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our financing activities provided cash of 688,540, including 315,933 from the sale of our common stock, 419,500 in net proceeds from convertible notes, and 270,000 in proceeds from note payment to shareholder. These inflows were offset by the repayment of 316,893 in convertible notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our financing activities provided cash of 607,500, including 412,500 from the sale of our common stock, 175,000 in net proceeds from convertible notes, and 20,000 in proceeds from note payment to shareholder. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Notes to Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Condensed Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Condensed Financial Statements. Derivative Liabilities The Company has certain financial instruments that are derivatives or contain embedded derivatives. The Company evaluates all its financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 810-10-05-4 and 815-40. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on extinguishment. When a convertible note that contains a bi-furcated derivative is converted, it is not considered to be a convertible note for accounting purposes. Therefore, the Company will recognize a gain or loss on the conversion as a debt extinguishment gain or loss based on the difference between the fair value of the shares issued and the book value of the debt converted. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires all stock-based awards granted to employees, directors and non-employees to be measured at grant date fair value of the equity instrument issued and recognized as expense. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally equivalent to the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The measurement date for the non-forfeitable awards to non-employees that vest immediately is the date the award is granted. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 of the condensed financial statements for discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not currently a party to, or otherwise involved with, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards None. Purchase of Significant Equipment We have not previously, nor do we intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 229.305(e)), we are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 17 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our President and CEO, who also serves as our CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure due to the material weaknesses described below. Based on our evaluation under the framework described above, our management concluded that we had material weaknesses (as such term is defined below) in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following as of the Evaluation Date: 1) lack of a functioning audit committee resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal control and procedures; and 2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. A material weakness is defined under SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. A system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during the Company s quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 18 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Except as discussed below, we are not presently a party to any material litigation, nor to the knowledge of management is any litigation threatened against us, which may materially affect us. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. Preferred Shares During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 1,000,000 Class A Preferred shares to Venu Aravamudan, 1,000,000 Class A Preferred shares to Govindan Gowrishankar, and 2,000,000 Class A Preferred shares to Austen Lambrecht for services valued at 2,930,000. Common Shares On July 9, 2024, the Company sold 3,343,500 shares to GHS Investments LLC for 96,517. On August 5, 2024, the Company sold 1,994,424 shares to GHS Investments LLC for 34,888. On September 17, 2024, the Company sold 4,162,313 shares to GHS Investments LLC for 62,597. Convertible Notes On July 22, 2024, the Company issued a convertible note to 1800 Diagonal Lending LLC in the principal amount of 70,150. On August 19, 2024, the Company issued a convertible note to 1800 Diagonal Lending LLC in the principal amount of 97,200. The securities above were issued in reliance upon the exemption from securities registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, based in part on the representations of the investors. No commissions were paid in connection with the sales of the securities above. Item 5. Other Information. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
