 Specific Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The Company elected to apply a practical expedient for collateral dependent assets in which the allowance for credit losses is calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated cost to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan. As such, these loans receivable are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs and are classified as Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the underlying collateral is determined using the market approach, the income approach, or a combination thereof. The significant unobservable input used for the income approach is the exit capitalization rate assumptions, which ranged from to . The significant unobservable input used for the market approach is the estimated fair value less cost to sell based on a negotiated price from an anticipated buyer.

 (2) Depending upon the significance of the fair value inputs utilized in determining these fair values, our collateralized loan obligations are classified as either Level II or Level III of the fair value hierarchy. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, the transfers from Level III to Level II were a result of the availability of current and reliable market data provided by third party pricing services or other valuation techniques which utilized observable inputs. 
 Repurchase agreements - commercial mortgage loans of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and repurchase agreements - real estate securities of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are not carried at fair value and do not include accrued interest expense, which are presented in Note 7 Debt. For these instruments, carrying value generally approximates fair value and are classified as Level III. 
 The fair value of the commercial mortgage loans, held for investment is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Advisor's experience with similar types of investments. The Company estimates the fair value of the collateralized loan obligations using external broker quotes. The mortgage note payable was recorded at transaction proceeds, which are considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. The fair value of the other financings is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. The fair value of the unsecured debt is based on discounted cash flows using Company estimates for market yields on similarly structured debt instruments.

 Interest rate swap agreements are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily using Level II Inputs in accordance with ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820). In determining fair value estimates for swaps, the Company utilizes the standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted future variable cash receipts which are based on expected future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves. The Company also incorporates both its own nonperformance risk and its counterparties nonperformance risk in determining fair value. In considering the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company considered the impact of netting and credit enhancements, such as collateral postings and guarantees, and has concluded that counterparty risk is not significant to the overall valuation.

 Overview 
 The Company is a Maryland corporation and has made tax elections to be treated as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes since 2013. The Company, through one or more subsidiaries which are each treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), is indirectly subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. We commenced business in May 2013. We primarily originate, acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate debt investments secured by properties located within and outside of the United States. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP, a Delaware limited partnership. We are the sole general partner and directly or indirectly hold all of the units of limited partner interests in the OP. 
 The Company has no employees. We are managed by the Advisor pursuant to an advisory agreement, as amended on August 18, 2021 (the "Advisory Agreement") with the Advisor. The Advisor manages our affairs on a day-to-day basis. The Advisor receives compensation and fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets and our operations. 
 The Advisor, an SEC-registered investment adviser, is a credit-focused alternative asset management firm. The Advisor manages funds for institutions and high-net-worth investors across various credit funds and complementary strategies including high yield, levered loans, private / opportunistic debt, liquid credit, structured credit and commercial real estate debt. These strategies complement each other as they all leverage the sourcing, analytical, compliance, and operational capabilities that encompass the Advisor s robust platform. The Advisor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc., which together with its various subsidiaries operates as "Franklin Templeton". 
 The Company invests in commercial real estate debt investments, which may include first mortgage loans, subordinated mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and participations in such loans. The Company also originates conduit loans which the Company intends to sell through its TRS into commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") securitization transactions. Historically this business has focused primarily on CMBS, commercial real estate collateralized loan obligation bonds and single asset single borrower bonds (collectively "CMBS bonds"), collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs") and other securities. The Company also owns real estate that was either acquired by the Company through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or that was purchased for investment, primarily subject to triple net leases.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Critical accounting estimates are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing the financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 (3) Fully extended maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower; provided, however, that our loans may be repaid prior to such date. 
 (4) Our floating rate loan agreements generally contain the contractual obligation for the borrower to maintain an interest rate cap to protect against rising interest rates. In a simple interest rate cap, the borrower pays a premium for a notional principal amount based on a capped interest rate (the cap rate ). When the floating rate exceeds the cap rate, the borrower receives a payment from the cap counterparty equal to the difference between the floating rate and the cap rate on the same notional principal amount for a specified period of time. When interest rates rise, the value of an interest rate cap will increase, thereby reducing the borrower's exposure to rising interest rates. 
 (5) As of September 30, 2024, all of our commercial mortgage loans, held for investment which had been indexed at LIBOR have been converted from LIBOR to compounded SOFR, plus a benchmark adjustment of 11.448 basis points, and the applicable spreads remain unchanged. The loans which have the SOFR adjustment are indicated with "Adj. 1M SOFR Term." 
 (6) Effective yield is calculated as the spread of the loan plus the greater of the applicable index or index floor. 
 (7) Loan-to-value percentage ("LTV") represents the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the property at the time of origination. However, for predevelopment construction loans at origination, LTV is not applicable and is therefore nil. 
 (8) Commitment on the loan was unfunded as of September 30, 2024.

 Results of Operations 
 The Company conducts its business through the following segments: 
 The real estate debt business focuses on originating, acquiring and asset managing commercial real estate debt investments, including first mortgages, subordinate mortgages, mezzanine loans and participations in such loans. 
 The real estate securities business focuses on investing in and asset managing real estate securities. Historically this business has focused primarily on CMBS, CMBS bonds, CDO notes, and other securities. 
 The commercial real estate conduit business operated through the Company's TRS, which is focused on generating risk-adjusted returns by originating and subsequently selling fixed-rate commercial real estate loans into the CMBS securitization market at a profit. The TRS may also hold certain mezzanine loans that don't qualify as good REIT assets due to any potential loss from foreclosure. 
 The real estate owned business represents real estate acquired by the Company through foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or purchase.

 Interest Income 
 Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 134.1 million and 137.0 million, respectively, a decrease of 2.9 million. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in non-performing loans, which averaged 189.8 million in principal during the three months ended September 30, 2024 partially offset by an increase in the average carrying value of our real estate debt. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of (i) 157 commercial mortgage loans, held for investment and (ii) ten real estate securities, available for sale, measured at fair value.

 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 89.9 million and 78.0 million, respectively, an increase of 11.9 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 444.6 million in the average carrying balance of our collateralized loan obligations coupled with an increase in deferred fee amortization due to the utilization of expected duration of our CLOs compared to contractual duration. 
 Revenue from Real Estate Owned 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from real estate owned was 5.4 million and 3.3 million, respectively.

General benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to the portfolio turnover of older vintage loans with new originated loans. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in general reserve was attributable to a more pessimistic view of the macroeconomic scenario utilized for the CECL model compared to preceding periods. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, specific provision for credit losses was 0.5 million compared to a specific benefit of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net Result from Derivative Transactions 
 Net result from derivative transactions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of a 1.3 million loss was composed of a realized loss of 1.6 million primarily related to the termination and settlement of credit default swaps and treasury note futures partially offset by an unrealized gain of 0.3 million. Net result from derivative transactions for the three months ended June 30, 2024 of a 0.2 million loss composed of a realized gain of 22.0 thousand primarily due to the termination and settlement of credit default swaps and treasury note futures offset by an unrealized loss of 0.2 million. 
 (Provision)/Benefit for Income Tax 
 Provision for income tax for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million compared to a benefit of 0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The difference is related to changes in taxable income/loss in our TRS segment. 
 Net (Income)/Loss Attributable to Non-controlling Interest 
 Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest in our consolidated joint ventures for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 was 1.4 million and 1.6 million, respectively. 
 Expenses from operations 
 Expenses from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Asset management and subordinated performance fee 4,906 6,252 Acquisition expenses 255 195 Administrative services expenses 3,801 704 Professional fees 3,588 3,864 Share-based compensation 2,134 2,087 Depreciation and amortization 1,387 1,417 Other expenses 5,709 3,202 Total expenses from operations 21,780 17,721 
 The increase in operating expense was primarily related to (i) an increase in administrative service expenses due to an increase in personnel time spent on securitizations and deal workout and (ii) an increase in REO operating expenses due to the onboarding of additional properties during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended June 30, 2024, offset by (iii) a decrease in incentive fees due to the decrease in projected income for the remainder of 2024 as the market adjusts for rate decreases.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our expected material cash requirements over the next twelve months and thereafter are composed of (i) contractually obligated payments, including payments of principal and interest and contractually-obligated fundings on our loans; (ii) other essential expenditures, including operating and administrative expenses and dividends paid in accordance with REIT distribution requirements; and (iii) opportunistic investments, including new loans. 
 Our contractually obligated payments primarily consist of payment obligations under the debt financing arrangements which are set forth below, and included in Contractual Obligations and Commitments. 
 We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities or repurchase or redeem our equity securities. Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. 
 We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe that we have sufficient current liquidity and access to additional liquidity to meet our financial obligations for the next twelve months and beyond. 
 Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio 
 The following table presents our debt-to-equity and total leverage ratios: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Net debt-to-equity ratio (1) 
 2.7x 2.3x Total leverage ratio (2) 
 2.9x 2.5x ________________________ 
 (1) Represents (i) total outstanding borrowings under secured financing arrangements, including collateralized loan obligations, repurchase agreements - commercial mortgage loans, repurchase agreements - real estate securities, asset-specific financing arrangements, and unsecured debt, less cash and cash equivalents, to (ii) total equity and total redeemable convertible preferred stock, at period end . Recourse net debt-to-equity ratio was 0.1x and 0.2x as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 (2) Represents (i) total outstanding borrowings under secured financing arrangements, including collateralized loan obligations, repurchase agreements - commercial mortgage loans, repurchase agreements - real estate securities, asset-specific financing arrangements, and unsecured debt, to (ii) total equity and total redeemable convertible preferred stock, at period end. Recourse leverage ratio was 0.3x and 0.4x as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity include unrestricted cash, capacity in our collateralized loan obligations available for reinvestment, and financings available and in progress on financing lines. 
 Our current sources of near-term liquidity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are set forth in the following table (dollars in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Unrestricted cash 346 338 CLO reinvestment available (1)

 645 1,131 Total 1,129 1,524 ________________________ 
 (1) See discussion below for further information on the Company's collateralized loan obligations. 
 (2) Represents cash available we can invest at a market advance rate utilizing our available capacity on financing lines. 
 We expect to use additional debt and equity financing as a source of capital. Our board of directors currently intends to operate at a leverage level of between one to three times book value of equity. However, our board of directors may change this target without shareholder approval. We anticipate that our debt and equity financing sources and our anticipated cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund our anticipated uses of capital. 
 We have an effective shelf registration statement for offerings of equity securities that is not limited on the amount of securities we may issue. We also have authorized an at-the-market sales program ("ATM") pursuant to which we may sell up to 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 200 million of shares of our common stock from time to time. We have not sold any shares of common stock under the ATM to date. We also may access liquidity through our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan ("DRIP"). 
 In addition to our current mix of financing sources, we may also access additional forms of financings, including credit facilities, securitizations, public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances by the Company or its subsidiaries, or through capital recycling initiatives whereby we sell certain assets in our portfolio and reinvest the proceeds in assets with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Collateralized Loan Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 137.6 million of reinvestment capital available across all outstanding collateralized loan obligations. The following table shows the par value outstanding for each CLO and the respective reinvestment end dates (dollars in millions): 
 CLO Name Debt Amount Reinvestment End Date 2021-FL6 Issuer 401.84 Ended 2021-FL7 Issuer 610.51 Ended 2022-FL8 Issuer 895.11 Ended 2022-FL9 Issuer 618.09 Ended 2023-FL10 Issuer 717.24 04/08/25 2024-FL11 Issuer 886.18 10/08/27 
 Repurchase Agreements and Revolving Credit Facilities ("Repo and Revolving Credit Facilities") 
 The Repo and Revolving Credit Facilities are financing sources through which the Company may pledge one or more mortgage loans to the financing entity in exchange for funds at an advance rate that typically ranges between 60 to 75 of the principal amount of the mortgage loan being pledged. 
 We expect to use the advances from these Repo and Revolving Credit Facilities to finance the acquisition or origination of eligible loans, including first mortgage loans, subordinated mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and participation interests therein. 
 The Repo and Revolving Credit Facilities generally provide that in the event of a decrease in the value of our collateral, the lenders can demand additional collateral. Should the value of our collateral decrease as a result of deteriorating credit quality, resulting margin calls may cause an adverse change in our liquidity position.

 The use of our warehouse lines is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to: origination volume, loan repayments and prepayments, our use of other financing sources such as collateralized loan obligations, our liquidity needs and types of loan assets and underlying collateral that we hold. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the maximum average outstanding balance was 1.1 billion, of which 0.8 billion was related to repurchase agreements on our commercial mortgage loans and 0.3 billion for repurchase agreements on our real estate securities.

 Distributions 
 In order to maintain our election to qualify as a REIT, we must currently distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to 90 of our taxable income, without regard to the deduction for distributions paid and excluding net capital gains. The Company must distribute 100 of its taxable income (including net capital gains) to avoid paying corporate U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Distributions on our common stock are payable when declared by our board of directors. 
 Dividends payable on each share of Series H convertible preferred stock ("Series H Preferred Stock") is generally equal to the quarterly dividend that would have been paid had such share of preferred stock been converted to a share of common stock, except to the extent common stock dividends have been reduced below certain specified levels. To the extent dividends on shares of preferred stock are not authorized and declared by our board of directors and paid by the Company monthly, the dividend amounts will accrue. 
 Holders of shares of the Company's 7.50 Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series E Preferred Stock") are entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by the Company, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 7.50 of the 25.00 per share liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to 1.875 per annum per share). 
 In September 2024, the Company's board of directors declared the following: (i) a third quarter 2024 dividend of 0.355 per share on the Company's common stock (equivalent to 1.42 per annum), (ii) a third quarter 2024 dividend of 106.216 per share on the Company s Series H Preferred Stock, and (iii) a third quarter 2024 dividend of 0.46875 per share on the Company s Series E Preferred Stock, all of which were paid in October 2024 to holders of record as of September 30, 2024. 
 Under the Company s DRIP, the Company may elect to supply shares for reinvestment via newly issued shares of common stock or via shares of common stock purchased by the DRIP administrator on the open market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 0 and 768 shares were newly issued, and 125,350 and 169,354 shares of common stock were purchased, respectively, by the administrator under the dividend reinvestment component of the DRIP. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid an aggregate of 88.4 million and 87.8 million, respectively, of common stock distributions.

 Election as a REIT 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. As a REIT, if we meet certain organizational and operational requirements and distribute at least 90 of our "REIT taxable income" (determined before the deduction of dividends paid and excluding net capital gains) to our stockholders in a year, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent of the income that we distribute. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our contractual obligations, excluding interest obligations (as amounts are not fixed or determinable), as of September 30, 2024 are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings to Common 
 Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP measure, which the Company defines as GAAP net income (loss), adjusted for (i) non-cash CLO amortization acceleration and amortization over the expected useful life of the Company's CLOs, (ii) unrealized gains and losses on loans and derivatives, including CECL reserves and impairments, net of realized gains and losses, as described further below, (iii) non-cash equity compensation expense, (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) subordinated performance fee accruals/(reversal), (vi) realized gains and losses on debt extinguishment and CLO calls, and (vii) certain other non-cash items. Further, Distributable Earnings to Common, a non-GAAP measure, presents Distributable Earnings net of (i) perpetual preferred stock dividend payments and (ii) non-controlling interests in joint ventures. 
 As noted in (ii) above, we exclude unrealized gains and losses on loans and other investments, including CECL reserves and impairments, from our calculation of Distributable Earnings and include realized gains and losses. The nature of these adjustments is described more fully in the footnotes to our reconciliation tables. GAAP loan loss reserves and any property impairment losses have been excluded from Distributable Earnings consistent with other unrealized losses pursuant to our existing definition of Distributable Earnings. We expect to only recognize such potential credit or property impairment losses in Distributable Earnings if and when such amounts are deemed nonrecoverable upon a realization event. This is generally at the time a loan is repaid, or in the case of a foreclosure or other property, when the underlying asset is sold. Amounts may also be deemed non-recoverable if, in our determination, it is nearly certain the carrying amounts will not be collected or realized. The realized loss amount reflected in Distributable Earnings will generally equal the difference between the cash received and the Distributable Earnings basis of the asset. The timing of any such loss realization in our Distributable Earnings may differ materially from the timing of the corresponding loss reserves, charge-offs or impairments in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 The Company believes that Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings to Common provide meaningful information to consider in addition to the disclosed GAAP results. The Company believes Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings to Common are useful financial metrics for existing and potential future holders of its common stock as historically, over time, Distributable Earnings to Common has been an indicator of common dividends per share. As a REIT, the Company generally must distribute annually at least 90 of its taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, and therefore believes dividends are one of the principal reasons stockholders may invest in its common stock. Further, Distributable Earnings to Common helps investors evaluate performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that the Company does not believe are necessarily indicative of current loan portfolio performance and the Company's operations and is one of the performance metrics the Company's board of directors considers when dividends are declared. 
 Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings to Common do not represent net income (loss) and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss). The methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings to Common may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies and thus may not be comparable to the Distributable Earnings reported by other companies.

 (1) Before Q1 2024, we adjusted GAAP income for non-cash CLO amortization acceleration to effectively amortize the issuance costs of our CLOs over the expected lifetime of the CLOs. We assume our CLOs will be outstanding for approximately four years and amortized the financing costs over approximately four years in our distributable earnings as compared to effective yield methodology in our GAAP earnings. Starting in Q1 2024, we amortized the issuance costs incurred on our CLOs over the expected lifetime of the CLOs in our GAAP presentation, making our previous adjustment no longer necessary. 
 (2) Represents unrealized gains and losses on (i) commercial mortgage loans, held for sale, measured at fair value, (ii) other real estate investments, measured at fair value and (iii) derivatives. 
 (3) Represents accrued and unpaid subordinated performance fee. In addition, reversal of subordinated performance fee represents cash payment obligations in the quarter. 
 (4) Represents amounts deemed nonrecoverable upon a realization event, which is generally at the time a loan is repaid, or in the case of a foreclosure or other property, when the underlying asset is sold. Amounts may also be deemed non-recoverable if, in our determination, it is nearly certain the carrying amounts will not be collected or realized upon sale. Amount may be different than the GAAP basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 11.9 million of GAAP loss adjustments that would run through distributable earnings if and when cash losses are realized.

 (5) Represents loan workout charges the Company incurred, which the Company deemed likely to be recovered. Reversal of loan workout charges represent recoveries received. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company recovered 5.1 million of loan workout charges, in aggregate, related to the loan workout charges incurred in the first, second, and third quarters of 2022 amounting to 1.9 million, 3.0 million, and 0.2 million, respectively. 
 (6) Represents the average of all classes of equity except the Series E Preferred Stock. 
 (7) Fully Converted assumes conversion of our series of convertible preferred stock and full vesting of our outstanding equity compensation awards. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our investments are subject to a high degree of credit risk. Credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults. Default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, borrower financial condition, property performance, property management, supply/demand factors, construction trends, consumer behavior, regional economics, interest rates, the strength of the U.S. economy, and other factors beyond our control. All loans are subject to a certain probability of default. We manage credit risk through the underwriting process, acquiring our investments at the appropriate discount to face value, if any, and establishing loss assumptions. We also carefully monitor the performance of the loans, as well as external factors that may affect their value. 
 Capital Market Risk 
 We are exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through borrowings under repurchase obligations or other debt instruments. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing and terms of capital we raise. 
 Market uncertainty and volatility may cause fluctuation in market value of certain asset classes within our portfolio. We have and may continue to receive margin calls from our lenders as a result of the decline in the market value of the assets pledged by us to our lenders under our repurchase agreements and warehouse credit facilities, and if we fail to resolve such margin calls when due by payment of cash or delivery of additional collateral, the lenders may exercise remedies including demanding payment by us of our aggregate outstanding financing obligations and/or taking ownership of the loans or other assets securing the applicable obligations and liquidating them at inopportune prices. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to interest rate fluctuations. Many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we may borrow funds at fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. We do not have any foreign denominated investments, and thus, we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our portfolio included 144 and 141 variable rate investments, respectively, based on LIBOR and SOFR (or "indexing rates") for various terms. As of June 2023, the Company has fully transitioned all loans formerly on LIBOR indexing rates to SOFR indexing rates. Borrowings under our financing arrangements are based on SOFR. The following table quantifies the potential changes in interest income net of interest expense should interest rates increase by 50 basis points or decrease by 50 or 100 basis points, assuming that our current balance sheet was to remain constant, and no actions were taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity. The changes in the portfolio for each basis points increase/decrease is a change from the base scenario.

 Real Estate Risk 
 The market values of commercial mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; and demographic factors. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), management with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of such period, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Please refer to Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings in "Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. The Company believes that those proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, operating results or cash flows. 
 Loan Fraud Lawsuit 
 The Company originated a loan in April 2022 secured by a portfolio of 24 properties net leased to Walgreens (the Collateral Properties ). As described in more detail in Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to the sponsor s fraud and default under the loan the Company foreclosed on all of the Collateral Properties in 2022 and 2023. The Company has sold some of the Collateral Properties, is marketing the others for sale and is actively pursuing its civil remedies. Note that the collectability, if any, of legal judgments we have achieved to date and that we may achieve in the future is not currently determinable. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our potential risks and uncertainties are presented in the section entitled "Risk Factors" contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes from these risk factors. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
 The Company s board of directors has authorized a 65 million share repurchase program that permits share repurchases at prices below the most recently reported book value per share as determined in accordance with GAAP. Purchases made under the Company s program may be made through open market, block, and privately negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any purchases by the Company are determined by the Company in its reasonable business judgment and consistent with the exercise of its legal duties and are subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The Company's share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. The Company s share repurchase program will remain open until expiration or until the capital committed to the repurchase program has been exhausted, whichever is sooner. In October 2024, the Company's board of directors extended the term of the share repurchase program to December 31, 2025. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may be suspended from time to time at the Company s discretion without prior notice. 
 The Company did not repurchase shares of common stock through its share repurchase program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of November 4, 2024, 31.1 million remains available under the Company s share repurchase program.
