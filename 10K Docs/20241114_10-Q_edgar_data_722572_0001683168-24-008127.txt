 (Unaudited) 

(approximately is
owned by non-controlling interests) as of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024. In the preparation of consolidated financial statements
of the Company, intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of the net earnings
of the subsidiary applicable to non-controlling interests. 

equity interests in FTI held by minority shareholders as of the reporting dates. As of September 30, 2024, the non-controlling
interest was , which represents a increase from as of June 30, 2024. The increase of in the non-controlling
interest consists of from income in the subsidiary of and from foreign exchange translation incurred for the
three months ended September 30, 2024. 

We generate revenue from two geographic
areas, consisting of North America and Asia. The following enterprise-wide disclosure is prepared on a basis consistent with the preparation
of the consolidated financial statements. The following table contains certain financial information by geographic area:

The balance of contract assets
was immaterial as we did not have a significant amount of un-invoiced receivables in the periods ended September 30, 2024, and June 30,
2024. 

Our contract liabilities are as
follows: 

Performance Obligations 

A performance obligation is a
promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606. At contract
inception, we assess the products and services promised in our contracts with customers. We then identify performance obligations to transfer
distinct products or services to the customer. In order to identify performance obligations, we consider all the products or services
promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. 

Our performance obligations are
primarily satisfied at a point in time. Revenue from products transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for of
net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Revenue recognized over a period of time for non-recurring engineering
projects is based on the percent complete of a project and accounted for of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023. The majority of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the sale of hotspot router products. Revenue from these contracts
is recognized when the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product, which generally
coincides with title transfer at completion of the shipping process. 

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023,
our contracts do not contain any unsatisfied performance obligations, except for undelivered products.

before technological feasibility is reached are expensed and included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

 of our accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2023. No other customers accounted for more than ten percent of total net
sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

For the three months ended September
30, 2024, we purchased the majority of our wireless data products from two manufacturing companies located in Asia. If these manufacturing
companies were to experience delays, capacity constraints or quality control problems, product shipments to our customers could be delayed,
or our customers could consequently elect to cancel the underlying product purchase order, which would negatively impact the Company's
revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased wireless data products from these manufacturers in the amount of
 , or of total purchases, and had related accounts payable of as of September 30, 2024. For the three months
ended September 30, 2023, we purchased wireless data products from these manufacturers in the amount of , or of total
purchases, and had related accounts payable of as of September 30, 2023. 

We maintain our cash accounts
with established commercial banks. Such cash deposits exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit of 250,000 for each
financial institution. However, we do not anticipate any losses on excess deposits.

Litigation 

We are from time to time involved
in certain legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. 

Verizon Jetpack Recall 

On April 8, 2021, Verizon issued
a press release announcing that it was working with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to conduct a voluntary recall of
certain Verizon Ellipsis Jetpack mobile hotspot devices, indicating that the lithium-ion battery in the devices can overheat, posing a
fire and burn hazard. According to the CPSC release, the recall affects approximately 2.5 million devices. We imported the devices and
supplied them to Verizon. 

Verizon first advised us of one
alleged Jetpack device failure at the end of February 2021. We immediately began meeting with Verizon and requested access to the device.
We also began internal testing to evaluate device performance. We did not receive any further incident information until the last week
of March 2021. On April 1, 2021 we issued a press release announcing that we had received reports from Verizon about potential issues
with the batteries in the devices. On April 9, 2021 we issued a press release announcing the voluntary recall by Verizon. 

As of the date of this report,
we have been unable to recreate any device failures of the type identified by Verizon. All internal testing conducted to date has confirmed
that the Jetpack devices are performing within normal parameters. We are not currently aware of any aspect of the Jetpack design that
could cause the devices to fail in the way described in Verizon s recall notice. 

Future Impact on Financial
Performance 

We are striving to avoid any litigation
with Verizon arising from the recall and have not been served with any legal action by Verizon relating to the products covered by the
recall. We are not currently able to estimate the financial impact of the recall on our future operations. At this time, we do not have
information that identifies the cause of the alleged incidents. We also do not have any specific legal claims or theories of causation
for device failure incidents that would help us estimate the cost of potential future litigation. No liability has been recorded for this
litigation because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time. 

Shareholder Litigation 

Ali 

A shareholder action, Ali vs.
Franklin Wireless Corp. et al. Case #3:21-cv-00687-AJB-MSB, was filed in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San
Diego) on April 16, 2021, alleging, among other things, that we had prior knowledge that the Verizon recall was likely and that we did
not disclose that information to investors in a timely manner. The Class and Defendants have executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement
under which the Class releases all claims against Defendants in exchange for a payment by Defendants of million (the Settlement
Amount ), which is reflected in liabilities under accrued legal contingency expense with a corresponding charge to
 loss from a legal contingency . The Class has submitted a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement, which the Court
denied on January 24, 2024. On April 22, 2024, after resubmission of the application, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.
On May 6, 2024, per the terms of the settlement agreement, we sent by wire transfer to an account specified by the Ali class
action claim administrator, Epiq (the appointed Settlement Administrator by the Court). 

Harwood / Martin 

A legal action was filed in the
U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San Diego) against Franklin, as a nominal defendant, by Stephen Harwood, derivatively
on behalf of nominal defendant Franklin Wireless Corp. v. O.C. Kim, et al., Case #21cv01837-AJB-MSB, on or about October 29, 2021, claiming
among other things, that we had prior knowledge that the recall was likely and that we did not disclose that information to investors
in a timely manner. We believe these allegations are not supported by the facts and we will vigorously defend against such claims. 

A legal action was filed in the
U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San Diego) against Franklin, as a nominal defendant, by Debra Martin, derivatively

among other things, that we had prior knowledge that the recall was likely and that we did not disclose that information to investors
in a timely manner. We believe these allegations are not supported by the facts and we will vigorously defend against such claims. 

The Harwood and Martin actions
have been consolidated into a single action in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San Diego) titled In re
Franklin Wireless Corp. Derivative Litigation , Case No.: 21cv1837-AJB (MSB). Discovery has been completed and trial is scheduled
to begin on December 9, 2024. 

Pape 

A legal action was filed in the
Second Judicial District Court of Nevada in the County of Washoe against Franklin, as a nominal defendant, Barbara Pape, derivatively
on behalf of nominal defendant Franklin Wireless Corp. v. O.C. Kim, et al., Case # CV22-00471, on or about March 21, 2022, claiming among
other things, that we had prior knowledge that the recall was likely and that we did not disclose that information to investors in a timely
manner. We believe these allegations are not supported by the facts and we will vigorously defend against such claims. 

The Company will vigorously defend
such shareholder litigation and proceedings. No liability has been recorded for these litigations because the Company believes that any
such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable as of the reporting date. 

Short-Swing Profits
Litigation 

A legal action was filed in the
U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San Diego) against Franklin, as a nominal defendant, Nosirrah Management LLC v.
Franklin Wireless et al., Case # 3:21-cv-01316-RSH-JLB, on or about July 22, 2021, claiming that our Chief Executive Officer, O.C. Kim,
violated Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for receiving short-swing profits from a sale and purchase
of Franklin shares, in violation of that Act. On October 19, 2023, the jury returned a verdict of 2,000,000 in favor of the Company against
the Company s Chief Executive Officer, O.C. Kim. Mr. Kim. Subsequently, the parties entered into a settlement agreement on June
12, 2024, for Mr. Kim to pay 1,000,000, and the appeal by OC Kim was dismissed. On September 23, 2024 the Company and Mr. Kim entered
into a Forbearance Agreement to defer payment of the settlement in exchange for deferment of a 1,250,000 bonus for securing a joint venture
agreement with MeiG Smart Technology Co., Ltd. to allow Mr. Kim time to pursue remedies with the State of Nevada. 

Loan Agreement with Subsidiary 

On March 21, 2022, Franklin Wireless
Corp. (the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with its South Korean subsidiary, FTI, under which the Company agreed
to loan US to FTI. The Company owns a majority of the outstanding equity of FTI. FTI s primary business is providing
design and development services to the Company for our wireless products. As part of the loan transaction, FTI delivered a 10 million
Promissory Note to the Company (the Note ). In the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the Company, the
transactions and balances related to the loan of 10 million, including the accrued interest for the three months ended September 30,
2024, were eliminated as intercompany transactions. 

The purpose of the loan is to allow FTI to purchase a facility in South Korea to house
its operations, and to provide it with additional working capital. The purchase of such a facility with the loan proceeds is subject
to the Company s reasonable approval. Upon acquisition of the facility, FTI is required to grant the Company a mortgage on it to
secure payment of the Note. The Note is for a term of five years, provides for annual payments of interest at 2 per annum, and is due
and payable upon maturity. The Note and Loan Agreement includes customary provisions for default and acceleration upon default, and a
default interest rate of 7 per annum. FTI has not yet acquired a facility for its operations. 

Employment Contracts 

On October 1, 2020, we entered
into Change of Control Agreements with OC Kim, our President, and Yun J. (David) Lee, our Senior Vice President of Sales and previously
served as Chief Operating Officer. Each Change of Control Agreement provides for a lump sum payment to the officer in case of a change
of control of the Company. The term includes the acquisition of Common Stock of the Company resulting in one person or company owning
more than 50 of the outstanding shares, a significant change in the composition of the Board of Directors of the Company during any 12-month
period, a reorganization, merger, consolidation or similar transaction resulting in the transfer of ownership of more than fifty percent
(50 of the Company s outstanding Common Stock, or a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or sale of substantially all of
the Company s assets. 

The Change of Control Agreement
with Mr. Kim calls for a payment of 5 million upon a change of control, and the agreement with Mr. Lee calls for a payment of 2 million
upon a change of control. These agreements were for an initial term of three years but have now been extended through October 2027. 

On November 10, 2022, the Company
and OC Kim, its President, entered into an amendment of the employment agreement dated September 7, 2021. The amendment provides for a
severance payment of 3 million if Mr. Kim voluntarily terminates his employment by the Company or if he voluntarily terminates his employment
due to a change in circumstances, generally defined as a material breach by the Company of its salary and benefit obligations
or a significant reduction in Mr. Kim s title or responsibilities. In the case of a termination of employment by the Company for
cause (generally defined as conviction of a felony, or a misdemeanor where imprisonment is imposed, commission of any act of theft, fraud,
dishonesty, or material falsification of any employment or Company records, or improper disclosure of the Company s confidential
or proprietary information), the Company is to make a severance payment of 1,500,000. In either case, any unvested options become immediately
vested. 

In the amendment, Mr. Kim also
agrees that, for a period of two years after termination, he will not disparage the Company or its officers, solicit any of its employees
to terminate their employment, or disclose any of the Company s proprietary information. In addition, the amendment provides
for the payment of an incentive bonus to Mr. Kim of 125,000 for each calendar quarter during the remaining four-year term of the employment
letter, with the first such bonus due on December 31, 2022. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, bonus had
been accrued, respectively, with and accrual bonus balances as of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, respectively. 

The employment agreement with
OC Kim was renewed and extended by the Board in September 2024 and will continue through October 2027. 

Forbearance Agreement 

On May 14, 2024, the Company entered
into an Agreement for Formation of Corporation (the Agreement with MeiG Smart Technology Co., Ltd. MeiG ),
a leading supplier of cellular modules, IoT terminals and wireless data solutions. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company and MeiG
are to form a Nevada corporation to be owned 60 by Franklin and 40 by MeiG. The Company will contribute to the new corporation
and MeiG will contribute , each for Common Stock in the new corporation. Under the terms of the Agreement, the new corporation
will have a Board of Directors consisting of three members, with two to be appointed by the Company and one to be appointed by MeiG. The
new company will engage in worldwide sales, marketing, customer support and operations for telecommunications modules to be provided by
MeiG, under such brands or designations as the Board of Directors of the new company will determine. As of September 30, 2024, contribution
for Common Stock has been made by the Company or MeiG. 

On September 23, 2024, the Board
acknowledged that Mr. Kim had earned an incentive bonus of for negotiating and securing a joint venture agreement with MeiG
Smart Technology Co., Ltd. However, the Company and Mr. Kim entered into a Forbearance Agreement, dated September 23, 2024, under which
Mr. Kim agreed to defer the bonus, in exchange for the Company s agreement to allow Mr. Kim to defer payment of the settlement
amount owed by Mr. Kim to the Company under a Settlement Agreement, dated June 12, 2024. The forbearance is to allow Mr. Kim time to pursue
remedies with the State of Nevada during the forbearance period (September 23, 2024 to September 23, 2025) 

International Tariffs 

We believe that our products are
currently exempt from international tariffs upon import from our manufacturers to the United States. However, following the 2024 US election,
it is possible that tariffs may be imposed on imports, but it is not currently known which countries imports will be affected.
If such tariffs are imposed, they could have a materially adverse effect on sales and operating results. 

Customer Indemnification 

Under purchase orders and contracts
for the sale of our products we may provide indemnification to our customers for potential intellectual property infringement claims for
which we may have no corresponding recourse against our third-party licensors. This potential liability, if realized, could materially
adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 

shares of Common
Stock. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted stock to our employees,
directors, and independent contractors. These options will have such vesting or other provisions as may be established by the Board of
Directors at the time of each grant. 

The estimated forfeiture rate
considers historical turnover rates stratified into employee pools in comparison with an overall employee turnover rate, as well as expectations
about the future. We periodically revise the estimated forfeiture rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
There were and compensation expenses recorded under this method for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this report. This report contains certain forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in
this report. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information, which speaks only as of the date of this report. We
are not obligated to publicly update this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the
extent we are required to do so in connection with our obligation to file reports with the SEC. For a discussion of the important risks
to our business and future operating performance, see the discussion under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors and under the
caption Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended June
30, 2024, filed on September 30, 2024. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed
in this report might not occur. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

Doing business as FranklinAccess ,
we are a leading global provider of integrated wireless solutions utilizing the latest 5G (fifth generation) and 4G LTE (fourth generation
long-term evolution) technologies including mobile hotspots, fixed wireless routers, and mobile device management (MDM) solutions. We
are a leading enabler of the Digital Divide initiative, and our expertise extends to innovation in Internet of Things (IOT) and machine-to-machine
(M2M) applications, driving forward seamless communication and connectivity for both individuals and enterprises. 

We have majority ownership of
Franklin Technology Inc. (FTI), a research and development company based in Seoul, South Korea. FTI primarily provides design and development
services for our wireless products. 

Our products are generally marketed
and sold directly to wireless operators and indirectly through strategic partners and distributors. Our primary markets are in North America
and Asia. 

FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We believe that our revenue growth
will be influenced largely by (1) the successful maintenance of our existing customers, (2) the rate of increase in demand for wireless
data products, (3) customer acceptance of our new products, (4) new customer relationships and contracts, (5) our ability to meet customers 
demands, (6) our ability to maintain good relationships with our manufacturing partners and suppliers, and (7) the defect rates experienced
by end users of our hardware and software products. 

We have entered into and expect
to continue to enter into new customer relationships and contracts for the supply of our products, and this may require significant demands
on our resources, resulting in increased operating, selling, and marketing expenses associated with such new customers. 

We continuously evaluate the performance
of our hardware and software products to discover defects that can adversely affect our revenue, income, and the price of our stock. If
defects occur that customers believe are either severe in nature or excessively frequent in occurrence, customers could stop buying our
products and services and the value of our stock may decrease. 

We are also seeing that demand
from end-users has been shifting in the post-pandemic economy as remote education and work from home trends are declining. Current demand
for mobile device management (MDM) services has been declining. We are working to improve and further enhance our software service offerings
to address this change in the market. 

26 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our discussion and analysis of
our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements in
accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions
have been prepared on the basis of the most current reasonably available information. The results of these estimates form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

We have several critical accounting
policies, which were described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, that are both important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective, and complex
judgments. Typically, the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective, and complex have to do with making estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies for the
three months ended September 30, 2024. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following table sets forth,
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our statements of comprehensive income (loss) including data expressed as a percentage

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED
TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

NET SALES - Net sales increased
by 3,667,366, or 38.0 , to 13,322,912 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9,655,546 for the corresponding period of
2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America and Asia, were 13,322,448
(100.0 of net sales) and 464 (0.0 of net sales), respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net sales by geographic
regions, consisting of North America and Asia, were 9,655,546 (100.0 of net sales) and 0 (0.0 of net sales), respectively. 

Net sales in North America increased
by 3,666,902, or 38.0 , to 13,322,448 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9,655,546 for the corresponding period of
2023. The increase in net sales in North America was primarily due to the increased sales of approximately 6.4M for our two wireless
products from two major carrier customers for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by the decreased sales
of one wireless product by approximately 2.7M, compared to the corresponding period of 2023. Net sales in Asia increased by 464, or
100 , to 464 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0 for the corresponding period of 2023. 

27 

GROSS PROFIT - Gross profit
increased by 558,342, or 36.9 , to 2,071,502 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,513,160 for the corresponding period
of 2023. The gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was 15.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.7 for
the corresponding period of 2023. 

The increase in gross profit was
primarily due to the change in net sales as described above. The decrease in gross profit margin in terms of net sales was primarily driven
by a decline in the proportion of high-margin sales while overall sales increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the corresponding period of 2023. 

OPERATING EXPENSES - Operating expenses increased
by 346,608, or 16.5 , to 2,444,285 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,097,677 for the corresponding period of 2023. 

Selling, general, and administrative
expenses increased by 189,251, or 15.4 , to 1,419,973 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1,230,722 for the corresponding
period of 2023. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increased legal expenses and payroll
expenses of approximately 74,000 and 70,000, respectively. 

Research and development expense
increased by 157,357, or 18.2 , to 1,024,312 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 866,955 for the corresponding period
of 2023. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to the increased sample generations to test new products of
approximately 150,000, which typically vary from period to period. 

TOTAL OTHER INCOME, NET 
- Other income, net increased by 872,063, or 442.1 , to 1,069,319 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 197,256 for the
corresponding period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the favorable changes in foreign currency and the gain from the appreciation
on the currency exchange rates in FTI of approximately 650,000 and the forgiven accrued commission from a customer of approximately 250,000. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our historical operating results,
capital resources and financial position, in combination with current projections and estimates, were considered in management's plan
and intentions to fund our operations over a reasonable period of time, which we define as the twelve-month period ending from the date
of the filing of this Form 10-Q. For purposes of liquidity disclosures, we assess the likelihood that we have sufficient available working
capital and other principal sources of liquidity to fund our operating activities and obligations as they become due. 

Our principal source of liquidity
as of September 30, 2024 consisted of cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term investments, of 40,678,153. We believe we have
sufficient available capital to cover our existing operations and obligations through at least one year from the date of the filing of
this Form 10-Q. Our long-term future cash requirements will depend on numerous factors, including our revenue base, profit margins, product
development activities, market acceptance of our products, future expansion plans and ability to control costs. If we are unable to achieve
our current business plan or secure additional funding that may be required, we would need to curtail our operations or take other similar
actions outside the ordinary course of business in order to continue to operate as a going concern. 

OPERATING ACTIVITIES -
Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,670,900, and net cash used in operating
activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 5,223,316. 

The 2,670,900 in net cash provided
by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable of 3,550,907
as well as our operating results (net income adjusted for depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash charges), which was partially
offset by the increase of inventories of 1,127,477 

The 5,223,316 in net cash used
in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in accounts payable of 5,800,795
and the increase of accounts receivable of 978,093 of as well as our operating results (net loss adjusted for depreciation, amortization,
and other non-cash charges), which was partially offset by the decrease in inventory of 1,479,279. 

28 

INVESTING ACTIVITIES 
Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 334,785 and 98,759, respectively. 

The 334,785 in net cash used
in financial activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was from the purchased short-term investments of 291,869 and the
payments for property and equipment of 21,544, respectively. 

The 98,759 in net cash used in
investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increased short-term investments of 73,832
and the payments for capitalized product development of 22,500. 

FINANCING ACTIVITIES -
Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 0 and 1,023, respectively. The 1,023
in net cash used in financial activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was from the increased loan interest to an employee. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS 

Leases 

We lease approximately 11,400
square feet of office space in San Diego, California, at a monthly rent of 27,789, which commenced on January 1, 2024. This lease will
expire on May 31, 2029. In addition to monthly rent, the lease includes payment for certain common area costs. Our facility is covered
by an appropriate level of insurance, and we believe it to be suitable for our use and adequate for our present needs. 

Our Korea-based subsidiary, FTI,
leases approximately 10,000 square feet of office space, at a monthly rent of approximately 8,000, and additional office space consisting
of approximately 2,682 square feet at a monthly rent of approximately 2,700, both located in Seoul, South Korea. These leases expired
on August 31, 2024, and were extended for an additional 24 months to August 31, 2026. In addition to monthly rent, the leases provide
for periodic cost of living increases in the base rent and payment for certain common area costs. These facilities are covered by an appropriate
level of insurance, and we believe them to be suitable for our use and adequate for our present needs.

facility, located in Seoul, South Korea, primarily for our employees who travel, under a non-cancelable operating lease that expires on
September 4, 2025.
