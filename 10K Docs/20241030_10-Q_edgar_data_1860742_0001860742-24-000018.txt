 Acquisition-related Contingent Consideration Obligations 
 Acquisition-related contingent consideration, which primarily consists of potential milestone payments, is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at its acquisition date estimated fair value, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in fair value measurement accounting. 
 The fair value measurement of contingent consideration obligations arising from business combinations is determined via a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis, using unobservable (Level 3) inputs. These inputs may include: (i) the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, (ii) the probability of the achievement of the factor(s) on which the contingency is based and (iii) the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. At September 30, 2024, the fair value measurements of acquisition-related contingent consideration were determined using risk-adjusted discount rates ranging from to , and a weighted average risk-adjusted discount rate of . The weighted average risk-adjusted discount rate was calculated by weighting each contract s relative fair value at September 30, 2024.

 Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually as of October 1st at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the same as, or one level below, an operating segment. Bausch + Lomb performs its annual impairment test by first assessing qualitative factors. Where the qualitative assessment suggests that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed for that reporting unit (Step 1). 
 2023 Annual Goodwill Impairment Test 
 The Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023 by performing a quantitative assessment for each of its reporting units. The quantitative assessment utilized long-term growth rates of and and discount rates ranging from and , in estimation of the fair value of the reporting units. After completing the testing, the fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded its carrying value by more than , and, therefore, there was impairment to goodwill. 
 September 30, 2024 Interim Assessment 
 No events occurred or circumstances changed during the period from October 1, 2023 (the last time goodwill was tested for all reporting units) through September 30, 2024 that would indicate that the fair value of any reporting unit might be below its carrying value. 
 If market conditions deteriorate, or if the Company is unable to execute its strategies, it may be necessary to record impairment charges in the future. 
 There were goodwill impairment charges from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

 common shares of Bausch + Lomb were originally authorized for issuance under the Plan. Effective April 24, 2023, Bausch + Lomb s shareholders approved an amendment and restatement of the Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance thereunder by an additional common shares, resulting in an aggregate common shares of Bausch + Lomb authorized for issuance under the Plan (the 2023 Plan Amendment ). At the Company s annual meeting of shareholders held on May 29, 2024, Bausch + Lomb s shareholders approved a further amendment and restatement of the Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance thereunder by an additional common shares, resulting in an aggregate common shares of Bausch + Lomb authorized for issuance under the Plan (the 2024 Plan Amendment ). 
 The Plan provides for the grant of various types of awards, including restricted stock units RSUs ), restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, stock options, performance-based awards and cash awards. Under the Plan, the exercise price of awards, if any, is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share on that date. Generally, stock options have a term of and a vesting period, subject to limited exceptions. 
 Approximately common shares were available for future grants as of September 30, 2024. Bausch + Lomb uses reserved and unissued common shares to satisfy its obligations under its share-based compensation plans. 
 The Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a Performance Share Unit PSU award for a limited number of key senior leaders (the Executives as of February 28, 2024, including each of the Company's current named executive officers (Brent Saunders, Sam Eldessouky, Bob Bailey, Yehia Hashad and Andrew Stewart) whose compensation is required to be disclosed pursuant to applicable U.S. securities laws (the "OPG PSU"). This OPG PSU award is designed to reward the Executives for achieving significant outperformance of performance goals that the Company believes would ultimately deliver substantial value to the Company's shareholders if achieved. 
 The OPG PSUs may be earned between and based on the level of achievement of: (i) a revenue metric (measured for fiscal year 2026) and (ii) a relative total shareholder return TSR metric (if applicable). Any OPG PSUs that are earned will vest on February 28, 2027, subject generally to the Executive s continued employment through such date, except in limited circumstances set forth in the applicable award agreement. 
 The fair value of the OPG PSUs was estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model, which utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that the performance condition will be achieved. Expense recognized for the OPG PSUs in each reporting period reflects the latest probability of the Company achieving certain revenue targets in determining the number of PSUs that are expected to vest. If the OPG PSUs do not ultimately vest due to the revenue targets not being met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. 
 During July 2024, the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved certain amendments to: (i) the TSR performance metric of certain PSU awards, including the previously granted OPG PSU and (ii) the time-based vesting conditions of awards previously granted to certain eligible recipients in connection with the B+L IPO (the "IPO Founder Grants"). The Company began accounting for these modifications during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. These modifications did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Product Development 
 We continuously search for new product opportunities through internal development, strategic licensing agreements and acquisitions, that, if successful, will allow us to leverage our commercial footprint and supplement our existing product portfolio and address specific unmet needs in the market. 
 Our team of approximately 850 dedicated Research and Development R D employees is focused on advancing our pipeline and identifying new product opportunities and we believe we have a significant innovation opportunity today. We plan to develop and, where applicable, commercialize our global pipeline of approximately 60 projects, many of which are global projects being developed in and for multiple countries. These global and individual projects are in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, including new contact lenses for myopia, next-generation cataract equipment, premium IOLs, investigational treatments for dry eye, novel formulation for eye vitamins and preservative free formulation of eye drops, among others, that are designed to grow our portfolio and accelerate future growth. 
 Our internal R D organization focuses on the development of products through robust bench testing that is designed to comply with international standards and through clinical trials. Certain key near-term pipeline products that have received a significant portion of our R D investment in current and prior periods are listed below.

 Strategic Acquisitions and Licensing Agreements 
 To supplement our internal R D initiatives and to build-out and refresh our product portfolio, we also search for opportunities to augment our pipeline through arrangements that allow us to gain access to unique products and investigational treatments, by strategically aligning ourselves with other innovative product solutions. In addition to licensing agreements, we selectively consider acquisitions that we believe align well with our current organization and strategic plan to help drive profitable growth and advance our mission of helping people see better to live better. Certain recent strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements that we have entered into include the following: 
 Acquisition of Trukera Medical In July 2024, we acquired TearLab Corporation, d/b/a Trukera Medical Trukera Medical from its private equity owner, AccelMed Partners, and other shareholders.

 Acquisition of XIIDRA In September 2023, the Company acquired XIIDRA , the first and only non-steroid eye drop specifically approved to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease focusing on inflammation associated with dry eye, and certain other ophthalmology assets from Novartis Pharma AG and Novartis Finance Corporation (together with Novartis Pharma AG, Novartis (the XIIDRA Acquisition ). The XIIDRA Acquisition complements and grows our existing dry eye franchise. 
 Acquisition of Blink Product Line In July 2023, we acquired the Blink OTC product line of eye and contact lens drops from Johnson Johnson Vision, which consists of Blink Tears Lubricating Eye Drops, Blink Tears Preservative Free Lubricating Eye Drops, Blink GelTears Lubricating Eye Drops, Blink Triple Care Lubricating Eye Drops, Blink Contacts Lubricating Eye Drops and Blink-N-Clean Lens Drops (collectively, the Blink Product Line ). This acquisition has enabled us to continue to grow our global OTC business. 
 Acquisition of AcuFocus During January 2023, we acquired AcuFocus, Inc. ("AcuFocus"). AcuFocus is an ophthalmic medical device company that has delivered breakthrough small aperture intraocular technology to address diverse unmet needs in eye care. The IC-8 Apthera IOL was approved by the FDA in July 2022 as the first and only small aperture non-toric EDOF IOL for certain cataract patients who have as much as 1.5 diopters of corneal astigmatism and wish to address presbyopia at the same time. We believe that the IC-8 Apthera TM IOL will bolster our surgical portfolio by enhancing our IOL offerings, which is a strategic area of focus for the Company. 
 We regularly consider further strategic licensing and acquisition opportunities, some of which could be material in size. 
 
 Business Trends 
 In addition to the actions previously outlined, the events described below have affected and may affect our business trends. The matters discussed in this section contain Forward-Looking Statements. Please see Forward-Looking Statements for additional information. 
 
 Russia-Ukraine War 
 In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. As military activity and sanctions against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine have continued, the war has continued to affect economic and global financial markets and placed further pressure on ongoing economic challenges, including issues such as inflation and global supply-chain disruption. 
 The Biden administration has imposed U.S. sanctions and export controls against Russia and Belarus in response to the ongoing war. These sanctions temporarily impacted our ability to distribute our U.S. manufactured contact lenses and our U.S. surgical products to Russia and Belarus. However, in response to these sanctions, we applied for licenses with the U.S. Department of Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security for both Russia and Belarus and we have all licenses, or other 

 33 

applicable governmental authorizations, necessary to allow us to sell the applicable currently sanctioned products in each of these countries. 
 In addition, the EU has also imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia. We have obtained licenses, where required, for products and services provided to Russia from the EU and from the relevant EU member states. 
 To date, the challenges associated with the Russia-Ukraine War and related sanctions from the U.S., EU and elsewhere have not yet had a material impact on our operations; although, as noted above, we continue to review recent EU sanctions and are still assessing their impact on our operations. 
 Our revenues attributable to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, in the aggregate, were approximately 3 of our total revenues for, both, the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, we do not have any research or manufacturing facilities in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus. While we have been monitoring this conflict, and will continue to do so as this conflict continues to evolve, we are unable to predict the impact of this conflict on the Company s business. 
 For a further discussion of these and other risks relating to our international business, see Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Business Trends of our Annual Report. 
 Conflict in the Middle East 
 The conflict between Israel and Hamas began during October 2023 and has since expanded to include other countries and militant groups and continues to impact the region. Our revenues attributable to the impacted regions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023 were less than 1 of our total revenues in each period. Sales in Iran are covered by a general OFAC license. While we have been monitoring this conflict, and will continue to do so as this conflict continues to evolve, we are unable to predict the impact of this conflict on the Company s business. 
 For a further discussion of these and other risks relating to our international business, see Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Business Trends of our Annual Report. 
 
 Supply Chain 
 Over the past few years we had experienced supply chain challenges, which had caused disruptions in availability and delays in shipping. We therefore implemented actions to help mitigate those challenges, including strategically spot buying key components of inventory and securing multiple supply sources. While we will continue to monitor any future supply chain challenges, the actions taken to mitigate our previous challenges had resulted in higher cost of inventory, which in turn had put pressure on our margins, primarily within our surgical business. 
 
 Global Minimum Corporate Tax Rate 
 On October 8, 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD )/G20 inclusive framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Inclusive Framework published a statement updating and finalizing the key components of a two-pillar plan on global tax reform originally agreed on July 1, 2021, and a timetable for implementation by 2023. The timetable for implementation has since been extended to 2024 or, with respect to certain components of the plan, to 2025. The Inclusive Framework plan has now been agreed to by 147 OECD members, including several countries which did not agree to the initial plan. Under pillar one, a portion of the residual profits of multinational businesses with global turnover above 20 billion and a profit margin above 10 will be allocated to market countries where such allocated profits would be taxed. Under pillar two, the Inclusive Framework has agreed on a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 for companies with revenue above 750 million, calculated on a country-by-country basis. On October 30, 2021, the G20 formally endorsed the new global minimum corporate tax rate rules. The Inclusive Framework agreement must now be implemented by the OECD Members who have agreed to the plan, effective in 2024. Many members of the Inclusive Framework have either introduced or announced their intention to introduce certain components of the global minimum tax in line with the model rules for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. For example, on December 15, 2022, the European Union member states unanimously adopted the directive to implement pillar two rules. According to the directive, the member states were expected to enact pillar two rules into domestic law in 2023, with certain elements becoming effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. On August 4, 2023, Canada released draft legislation to enact certain components of the pillar two proposals into Canadian law as the Global Minimum Tax Act GMTA ), which was enacted on June 20, 2024. The GMTA is generally aligned with the model rules proposed by the OECD and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. The United States did not announce plans to enact the tax measures under the two-pillar plan. On February 1, 2023, the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board indicated that they believe the minimum tax imposed under pillar two is an alternative minimum tax, and, accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 34 

associated with the minimum tax would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated future effects of the minimum tax but would be recognized in the period incurred. The OECD has published model rules and other guidance with respect to pillar two, which are generally consistent with the agreement reached by the Inclusive Framework in October 2021. On February 1, 2023, the Inclusive Framework released a package of technical and administrative guidance on the implementation of pillar two, including the scope of companies that will be subject to the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules, transition rules, and guidance on domestic minimum taxes that countries may choose to adopt, among other topics. On December 18, 2023 the OECD announced plans to release additional guidance on model rules and to start the peer review process in 2024. On June 17, 2024, the OECD published further administrative guidance to clarify the operation of the model rules. While many jurisdictions in which the Company operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the OECD pillar two effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, the Company has concluded that there is minimal impact to its 2024 tax rate due to the accounting for the tax effects of intercompany transactions. The Company expects that there is risk that the impact of the global minimum tax may eventually result in an increase to its overall effective tax rate. 
 
 Health Care Reform 
 The U.S. federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the health care industry. Many of these changes focus on health care cost containment, which result in pricing pressures relating to the sales and reimbursements of health care products. The Biden administration and Congress continue to focus on health care cost containment which could result in legislative and regulatory changes that may negatively impact our businesses. 
 In addition, we continue to face various proposed health care pricing changes and regulations from governments throughout the world in locations in which we operate our business. These proposed changes may also continue to result in pricing pressures relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of our product portfolio. 
 We continually review newly enacted and proposed U.S. federal and state legislation, as well as proposed rulemaking and guidance published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA and applicable foreign governments in locations in which we operate; however, at this time, it is unclear the effect these matters may have on our businesses. 
 
 Generic Competition and Loss of Exclusivity 
 Certain of our products face the expiration of their patent or regulatory exclusivity, following which we anticipate generic competition of these products. Following a loss of exclusivity LOE of and/or generic competition for a product, we would anticipate that product sales for such product would decrease significantly shortly following the LOE or entry of a generic competitor. Where we have the rights, we may elect to launch an authorized generic AG of such product (either ourselves or through a third party) prior to, upon or following generic entry, which may mitigate the anticipated decrease in product sales. 
 Prolensa began facing LOE in the fourth quarter of 2023, which accounted for approximately 1 of our total revenues in 2023. While we expect our risk of LOE to be limited over the next five years, this could change based on, among other things, successful challenge to our patents, settlement of existing or future patent litigation and at-risk generic launches. We believe the entry into the market of generic competition generally would have an adverse impact on the volume and/or pricing of the affected products, however we are unable to predict the magnitude or timing of this impact. 
 In addition, in connection with our Lumify , PreserVision , Vyzulta and Lotemax SM products, we have commenced ongoing infringement proceedings against potential generic competitors or other potential infringers in the U.S. If we are not successful in these proceedings, we may face increased generic competition for these products. 
 In addition, the PreserVision U.S. formulation patent expired in March 2021, but a patent covering methods of using the formulation remains in force into 2026. PreserVision products accounted for approximately 7 and 7 of our total revenues in 2023 and 2022, respectively. PreserVision is (or was) the subject of certain ongoing and past patent infringement proceedings. While the Company cannot predict the magnitude or timing of the impact from the PreserVision patent expiry, this is an OTC product and thus, the impact is not expected to be as significant as the LOE of a branded pharmaceutical product. 
 See Note 16, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS to our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, as well as Note 20, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report , for further details regarding certain of these infringement proceedings. 
 The risks of generic competition are a fact of the eye health industry and are not specific to our operations or product portfolio. These risks are not avoidable, but we believe they are manageable. To manage these risks, our leadership team routinely evaluates the impact that generic competition may have on future profitability and operations. In addition to aggressively defending our patents and other intellectual property, our leadership team makes operational and investment 

 35 

decisions regarding these products and businesses at risk, including decisions regarding our pipeline. Our leadership team actively manages our pipeline in order to identify innovative and realizable projects that are expected to provide incremental and sustainable revenues and growth into the future. We believe that we have a well-established product portfolio that is diversified within our core businesses. We also believe that we have a robust pipeline that not only provides for the next generation of our existing products, but also brings new solutions into the market. 
 See the section entitled Risk Factors included in our Annual Report, for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property and our competition risks.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues are primarily generated from product sales in the therapeutic areas of eye health that consist of: (i) branded prescription eye-medications and pharmaceuticals, (ii) generic and branded generic prescription eye medications and pharmaceuticals, (iii) OTC vitamin and supplement products and (iv) medical devices (contact lenses, IOLs and ophthalmic surgical equipment). Other revenues include alliance and service revenue from the licensing and co-promotion of products and contract service revenue. Contract service revenue is derived primarily from contract manufacturing for third parties and is not material. See Note 17, SEGMENT INFORMATION to our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the disaggregation of revenues which depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by the economic factors of each category of customer contracts. 
 Our revenues were 1,196 million and 1,007 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 189 million, or 19 . The increase was attributable to: (i) incremental sales attributable to acquisitions of 96 million, primarily within our Pharmaceuticals segment, (ii) increased volumes of 81 million across each of our segments and (iii) increased net realized pricing of 20 million, primarily driven by our Vision Care segment. The increases in revenue were partially offset by: (i) the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies of 5 million, primarily in Latin America, and (ii) the impact of divestitures and discontinuations of 3 million, particularly the discontinuation of certain products within our Pharmaceuticals segment. 
 The following table presents segment revenues, segment revenues as a percentage of total revenues and the period-over-period changes in segment revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 2024 2023 Change (in millions) Amount Pct. Amount Pct. Amount Pct. Segment Revenues Vision Care 684 57 648 64 36 6 Pharmaceuticals 306 26 174 17 132 76 Surgical 206 17 185 19 21 11 Total revenues 1,196 100 1,007 100 189 19 
 Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Growth (non-GAAP) 
 Constant Currency Revenue Growth, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as a change in Revenues (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) on a period-over-period basis adjusted for changes in foreign currency exchange rates (if applicable). The Company uses Constant Currency Revenues (non-GAAP) and Constant Currency Revenue Growth (non-GAAP) to assess performance of its reportable segments, and the Company in total, without the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The Company believes that such measures are useful to investors as they provide a supplemental period-to-period comparison. 
 Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates are part of our business, they are not within management s control. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, however, can mask positive or negative trends in the underlying business performance. The impact for changes in foreign currency exchange rates is determined as the difference in the current period reported revenues at their current period currency exchange rates and the current period reported revenues revalued using the monthly average currency exchange rates during the comparable prior period. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios are not prepared in accordance with GAAP nor do they have any standardized meaning under GAAP. In addition, other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures and ratios that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures and ratios. Accordingly, the Company s non-GAAP financial measures and ratios may not be comparable to such similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures and ratios used by other companies.

The following table presents a reconciliation of Revenues to constant currency revenues (non-GAAP) and the period-over-period changes in constant currency revenue (non-GAAP) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Vision Care Segment Revenue 
 The Vision Care segment revenue was 684 million and 648 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 36 million, or 6 . The increase was primarily driven by sales from our dry eye portfolio within our consumer eye care business and SiHy Daily lenses within our contact lens business. This increase included: (i) an increase in volumes of 24 million and (ii) an increase in net pricing of 16 million, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies of 4 million, primarily in Latin America. 
 Our 2023 revenues were negatively impacted due to previously unfulfilled orders at our Lynchburg distribution facility. During the second quarter of 2023, we put into place a system upgrade; however, we incurred disruptions during the implementation of this upgrade, which resulted in slower than normal processing of certain orders, thereby negatively impacting our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We substantially resolved the Lynchburg implementation disruptions during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Pharmaceuticals Segment Revenue 
 The Pharmaceuticals segment revenue was 306 million and 174 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 132 million, or 76 . The increase was primarily driven by: (i) the XIIDRA Acquisition and (ii) the launch of MIEBO in September 2023. This increase included: (i) incremental sales from the XIIDRA Acquisition of 92 million and (ii) an increase in volumes of 44 million, partially offset by: (i) the impact of discontinuations of 3 million and (ii) a decrease in net realized pricing of 1 million. 
 Surgical Segment Revenue 
 The Surgical segment revenue was 206 million and 185 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 21 million, or 11 . The increase was primarily driven by: (i) increased demand of consumables, (ii) increased system sales and (iii) increased demand of implantables, driven by our premium IOL portfolio. This increase included: (i) an increase in volumes of 13 million, (ii) an increase in net realized pricing of 5 million and (iii) incremental sales from acquisitions of 4 million, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currencies of 1 million. 
 Cash Discounts and Allowances, Chargebacks and Distribution Fees 
 As is customary in the health care industry, gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions in arriving at net product sales. Provisions for these deductions are recognized concurrently with the recognition of gross product sales. These provisions include cash discounts and allowances, chargebacks and distribution fees, which are paid or credited to direct customers, as well as rebates and returns, which can be paid or credited to direct and indirect customers. Provision balances relating to amounts payable to direct customers are netted against trade receivables and balances relating to indirect customers are included in accrued liabilities. 
 We actively manage these offerings, focusing on the incremental costs of our patient assistance programs, the level of discounting to non-retail accounts and identifying opportunities to minimize product returns. We also concentrate on managing our relationships with our payors and wholesalers, reviewing the ranges of our offerings and being disciplined as to the amount and type of incentives we negotiate. Provisions recorded to reduce gross product sales to net product sales and revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 

 38 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions) Amount Pct. Amount Pct. Gross product sales 1,853 100.0 1,394 100.0 Provisions to reduce gross product sales to net product sales Discounts and allowances 107 5.8 92 6.6 Returns 26 1.4 22 1.6 Rebates 358 19.3 136 9.8 Chargebacks 150 8.1 134 9.6 Distribution fees 20 1.1 6 0.4 Total provisions 661 35.7 390 28.0 Net product sales 1,192 64.3 1,004 72.0 Other revenues 4 3 Revenues 1,196 1,007 
 Cash discounts and allowances, returns, rebates, chargebacks and distribution fees as a percentage of gross product sales were 35.7 and 28.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 7.7 percentage points, and is primarily attributable to the increase in rebates from XIIDRA and MIEBO . 
 Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Goods Sold (exclusive of amortization and impairments of intangible assets) 
 Cost of goods sold primarily includes: manufacturing and packaging; the cost of products we purchase from third parties; royalty payments we make to third parties; depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment; and lower of cost or market adjustments to inventories. Cost of goods sold typically vary between periods as a result of product mix, volume, royalties, changes in foreign currency and inflation. Cost of goods sold excludes the amortization and impairments of intangible assets. 
 Cost of goods sold was 464 million and 391 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 73 million, or 19 . The increase was primarily driven by: (i) costs of sales associated with acquisitions entered into subsequent to September 30, 2023, which includes the amortization of inventory step-up and (ii) higher volumes. 
 Contribution (product sales revenue less cost of goods sold, exclusive of amortization and impairments of intangible assets) increased by 115 million, primarily driven by: (i) contribution associated with acquisitions entered into subsequent to September 30, 2023, (ii) the increase in volumes, including related to the launch of MIEBO during September 2023 and (iii) the increase in net realized pricing, as previously discussed. 
 Cost of goods sold as a percentage of Product sales was 38.9 and 38.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses primarily include: employee compensation associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other administrative functions; certain outside legal fees and consultancy costs; product promotion expenses; overhead and occupancy costs; depreciation of corporate facilities and equipment; and other general and administrative costs. 
 SG A expenses were 511 million and 418 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 93 million, or 22 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher selling and advertising and promotion costs, primarily attributable to XIIDRA and the launch of MIEBO . 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Included in R D are costs related to our product development and quality assurance programs. Expenses related to product development include: employee compensation costs; overhead and occupancy costs; depreciation of research and development facilities and equipment; clinical trial costs; clinical manufacturing and scale-up costs; and other third-party 

 39 

development costs. Quality assurance are the costs incurred to meet evolving customer and regulatory standards and include: employee compensation costs; overhead and occupancy costs; amortization of software; and other third-party costs. 
 R D expenses were 84 million and 82 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 2 million, or 2 . 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally 3 to 17 years. Management continually assesses the useful lives related to our long-lived assets to reflect the most current assumptions. 
 Amortization of Intangible assets was 72 million and 47 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 25 million, or 53 , primarily due to assets acquired through acquisitions, as previously discussed. 
 See Note 8, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL to our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Amortization of intangible assets. 
 Other expense, net 
 Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consists of the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Restructuring, integration and separation costs 3 11 Litigation and other matters 1 2 Acquired in-process research and development costs 15 Acquisition-related costs 2 16 Acquisition-related contingent consideration 1 (1) Other expense, net 
 22 28 
 Operating income 
 Operating income was 43 million and 40 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 3 million. This increase primarily reflects the increase in contribution, partially offset by increases in SG A and amortization expense, each as previously discussed. 
 Segment Profit 
 Segment profit is based on operating income after the elimination of intercompany transactions. Certain costs, such as Amortization of intangible assets and Other expense, net, are not included in the measure of segment profit, as management excludes these items in assessing segment financial performance. Segment profit is a measure of operating performance of our reportable segments and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Segment profit is a performance metric utilized by the Company s CEO, who is the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker, to allocate resources to and assess performance of the Company s segments. See Note 17, SEGMENT INFORMATION to our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of segment profit to Income before provision for income taxes. 
 The following table presents segment profits, segment profits as a percentage of segment revenues and the period-over-period changes in segment profits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Vision Care Segment Profit 
 The Vision Care segment profit was 201 million and 182 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 19 million, or 10 . The increase was primarily driven by: (i) increased contribution, driven by the increases in volume and pricing, as previously discussed and (ii) lower R D expense to strategically position our portfolio within our consumer eye care business. The increase in contribution was partially offset by higher advertising and promotional expenses in our consumer eye care business driven by the Blink OTC product line, acquired in July 2023. 
 Pharmaceuticals Segment Profit 
 The Pharmaceuticals segment profit was 69 million and 53 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 16 million, or 30 . The increase was primarily driven by increased contribution, primarily driven by XIIDRA and MIEBO , partially offset by selling and advertising and promotional expenses related to MIEBO and XIIDRA . 
 Surgical Segment Profit 
 The Surgical segment profit was 13 million and 9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 4 million, or 44 , primarily due to the increase in revenues, partially offset by higher cost of sales and higher selling expenses. 
 Non-Operating Income and Expense 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense primarily consists of interest payments due, amortization of debt discounts and deferred issuance costs on indebtedness under our credit facilities. 
 Interest expense was 100 million and 76 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 24 million . The increase is primarily attributable to interest expense associated with our October 2028 Secured Notes and September 2028 Term Facility (each as defined and discussed in further detail, under Item Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Debt Long-term Debt ), partially offset by certain upfront financing commitment costs incurred in connection with the XIIDRA Acquisition during the prior period. See Note 10, FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS to our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the October 2028 Secured Notes and September 2028 Term Facility. 
 Foreign Exchange and Other 
 Foreign exchange and other primarily includes translation gains/losses on intercompany balances and third-party liabilities and the gain/loss due to the change in fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts. Foreign exchange and other was a net loss of 5 million and 3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues were 3,511 million and 2,973 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 538 million, or 18 . The increase was attributable to: (i) incremental sales attributable to acquisitions of 288 million, primarily within our Pharmaceuticals segment, (ii) increased volumes of 226 million across each of our segments and (iii) increased net realized pricing of 83 million, primarily driven by our Vision Care segment. The increase in revenues were partially offset by: (i) the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies of 52 million, primarily in Asia and Latin America and (ii) the impact of divestitures and discontinuations of 7 million, particularly the discontinuation of certain products within our Pharmaceuticals and Vision Care segments. 
 The following table presents segment revenues, segment revenues as a percentage of total revenues and the period-over-period changes in segment revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Vision Care Segment Revenue 
 The Vision Care segment revenue was 2,016 million and 1,881 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 135 million, or 7 . The increase was primarily driven by sales from our dry eye portfolio and Lumify within our consumer eye care business and SiHy Daily lenses within our contact lens business. This increase included: (i) an increase in net pricing of 79 million, (ii) an increase in volumes of 75 million and (iii) incremental sales attributable to acquisitions driven by the acquisition of the Blink Product Line in July 2023, partially offset by: (i) the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies of 42 million, primarily in Russia, Asia and Latin America, and (ii) the impact of discontinuations. 
 Our 2023 revenues were negatively impacted due to previously unfulfilled orders at our Lynchburg distribution facility. During the second quarter of 2023, we put into place a system upgrade; however, we incurred disruptions during the implementation of this upgrade, which resulted in slower than normal processing of certain orders, thereby negatively impacting our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We substantially resolved the Lynchburg implementation disruptions during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Pharmaceuticals Segment Revenue 
 The Pharmaceuticals segment revenue was 883 million and 529 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 354 million, or 67 .

This increase included: (i) incremental sales from the XIIDRA Acquisition of 260 million and (ii) an increase in 

 42 

volumes of 116 million, partially offset by: (i) a decrease in net realized pricing of 12 million, (ii) the impact of discontinuations of 6 million and (iii) the unfavorable effect of foreign currencies of 4 million. 
 Surgical Segment Revenue 
 The Surgical segment revenue was 612 million and 563 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 49 million, or 9 .

This increase included: (i) an increase in volumes of 35 million, (ii) an increase in net realized pricing of 16 million and (iii) incremental sales from acquisitions of 4 million, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currencies of 6 million. 
 Cash Discounts and Allowances, Chargebacks and Distribution Fees 
 Provisions recorded to reduce gross product sales to net product sales and revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 Cost of Goods Sold (exclusive of amortization and impairments of intangible assets) 
 Cost of goods sold was 1,369 million and 1,179 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 190 million, or 16 . The increase was primarily driven by: (i) costs of sales associated with acquisitions entered into subsequent to September 30, 2023, which includes the amortization of inventory step-up and (ii) higher volumes. 
 Contribution (product sales revenue less cost of goods sold, exclusive of amortization and impairments of intangible assets) increased by 346 million, primarily driven by: (i) contribution associated with acquisitions entered into subsequent to September 30, 2023, (ii) the increase in volumes, including related to the launch of MIEBO during September 2023 and (iii) the increase in net realized pricing, as previously discussed. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies.

 The Vision Care segment profit was 571 million and 503 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 68 million, or 14 . The increase was primarily driven by: (i) increased contribution, driven by the increases in pricing and volume, as previously discussed and (ii) lower R D expense within our consumer eye care business.

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 210 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used by operating activities of 32 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 242 million. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was positively impacted by: (i) our net earnings, excluding non-cash expenses and other adjustments primarily for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes and share-based compensation, and (ii) changes in our operating assets and liabilities driven by the timing of payments, partially offset by an increase in inventories and interest payments. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by: (i) ongoing operating expenses, (ii) interest payments and (iii) the change in our operating assets and liabilities, due to: (a) a strategic increase in inventories, (b) the timing of payments in the ordinary course of business and (c) growth in sales volumes, as previously discussed, which drove an increase in our trade receivables. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 227 million and 1,974 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 1,747 million and was primarily driven by payments related to acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 1,892 million primarily related to the XIIDRA Acquisition, the acquisition of the Blink Product Line and the acquisition of AcuFocus, each as previously discussed, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Payments related to acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 47 million primarily related to the acquisition of Trukera Medical, as previously discussed, and certain other investments. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 32 million and 1,992 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 1,960 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to less borrowings of debt. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, issuances of long-term debt, net of discounts were 125 million, representing borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, issuances of long-term debt, net of discounts were 2,180 million, related to the September 2028 Term Facility, the October 2028 Secured Notes and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined below). 
 Liquidity and Debt 
 Future Sources of Liquidity 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are expected to be our cash and cash equivalents, cash collected from customers, funds as needed from our Revolving Credit Facility, and issuances of other long-term debt, additional equity and equity-linked securities. We believe these sources will be sufficient to meet our current liquidity needs for the next twelve months, from the date of issuance of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, and be sufficient to support our future cash needs, however, we can provide no assurance that our liquidity and capital resources will meet future funding requirements. 
 The global financial markets recently have undergone and may continue to experience significant volatility and disruption. The timing and sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional macroeconomic, business and 

 46 

financial disruptions may arise. As markets change, there can be no assurance that the challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing on reasonable terms or at all. 
 We regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and various financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. If opportunities are favorable, we may from time to time enter into new financing arrangements, refinance the Credit Facilities (as defined below) or repurchase debt, or issue additional equity and equity-linked securities. 
 Long-term Debt 
 On May 10, 2022, in connection with the B+L IPO and in order to properly capitalize our business, Bausch + Lomb entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement , and the credit facilities thereunder, the Credit Facilities ). Prior to the September 2023 Credit Facility Amendment (as defined below), the Credit Agreement provided for a term loan of 2,500 million with a five-year term to maturity (the May 2027 Term Facility and a five-year revolving credit facility of 500 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ).

A portion of the proceeds from the September 2028 Term Facility and October 2028 Secured Notes were used to finance the 1,750 million upfront payment related to the XIIDRA Acquisition and related acquisition and financing costs. 
 On April 19, 2024, Bausch + Lomb entered into a Suspension of Rights Agreement (the Suspension of Rights Agreement with respect to the Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Canadian dollar-denominated loans ceased to be available from June 28, 2024 until such date as the parties enter into an amendment of the Credit Agreement to replace the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate with an alternative benchmark with respect to Canadian dollar-denominated loans.

A portion of the proceeds from the October 2028 Secured Notes, along with the proceeds of September 2028 Term Facility, were used to finance the 1,750 million upfront payment related to the acquisition of XIIDRA and certain other ophthalmology assets from Novartis and related acquisition-related transaction and financing costs. The October 2028 Secured Notes accrue interest at a rate of 8.375 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on each April 1 and October 1, which commenced on April 1, 2024. 
 The October 2028 Secured Notes are guaranteed by each of the Company s subsidiaries that is a guarantor under the Amended Credit Agreement (the Note Guarantors ). The October 2028 Secured Notes and the guarantees related thereto are senior obligations and are secured, subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions, by the same first priority liens that secure the Company s obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement under the terms of the indenture governing the October 2028 Secured Notes.

 Rating Agency Corporate Rating Senior Secured Rating Outlook Moody s B1 Stable Standard Poor s B- B- Positive Fitch B- BB- Rating Watch Evolving

 Upon full Separation, we expect to refinance the Bausch + Lomb debt, and to transition to a longer-term capital structure. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital expenditures, liquidity, or capital resources. 
 Other Future Cash Requirements 
 Our other future cash requirements relate to working capital, capital expenditures, business development transactions (contingent consideration), restructuring and integration, benefit obligations and litigation settlements. In addition, we may use cash to enter into licensing arrangements and/or to make strategic acquisitions. We regularly consider further acquisition opportunities within our core therapeutic areas, some of which could be sizable. 
 In addition to our working capital requirements, as of the date of this filing, October 30, 2024, we expect our primary cash requirements for the period October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 to include: 
 Debt repayments and interest We expect to make interest payments of approximately 130 million and mandatory debt amortization payments of 8 million for the period October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and may elect to make additional principal payments under certain circumstances. Further, in the ordinary course of business, we may borrow and repay amounts under our Revolving Credit Facility to meet business needs, see Item 1A. Risk Factors "Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations included in our Annual Report; 
 Capital expenditures We expect to make payments of approximately 50 million for property, plant and equipment for the period October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. 
 Cost Savings Programs 
 The Company has been launching certain initiatives that may result in certain changes to, and investment in, its organizational structure and operations. The Company refers to the charges related to these initiatives as Business Transformation Costs . These costs are recorded in SG A in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and include third-party advisory costs, as well as certain compensation-related costs associated with changes in 

 49 

the Company s executive officers, such as severance-related costs associated with the departure of the Company s former executives and the costs associated with the appointment of the Company s new executives. 
 Further, we continue to evaluate opportunities to improve our operating performance and may initiate cost savings programs to streamline our operations and eliminate redundant processes and expenses. These cost savings programs may include, but are not limited to: (i) reducing headcount, (ii) eliminating real estate costs associated with unused or under-utilized facilities and (iii) implementing contribution margin improvement and other cost reduction initiatives. Although a specific plan does not exist at this time, we may identify and take additional exit and cost-rationalization restructuring actions in the future, the costs of which could be material. 
 Future Litigation 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in litigation, claims, government inquiries, investigations, charges and proceedings. See Note 16, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS to our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of these matters. Our ability to successfully defend the Company against pending and future litigation may impact cash flows. 
 Future Licensing Payments 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into select licensing and collaborative agreements for the commercialization and/or development of unique products. In connection with these agreements, the Company may pay an up-front fee to secure the agreement. See Note 21, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report. 
 
 OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA 
 Our common shares are listed on the TSX and the NYSE under the ticker symbol BLCO . 
 At October 23, 2024, we had 352,164,025 issued and outstanding common shares. In addition, as of October 23, 2024, we had outstanding approximately 9,000,000 stock options and 6,800,000 restricted share units that each represent the right of a holder to receive one of Bausch + Lomb s common shares and 4,100,000 performance-based restricted share units that represent the right of a holder to receive a number of the Company s common shares up to a specified maximum. A maximum of 10,600,000 common shares could be issued upon vesting of the performance-based restricted share units outstanding. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies and estimates that are most important and material to the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and which require management s most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to select policies from among alternatives available, and to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has reassessed the critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report, and determined that there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 None.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect actual outcomes, except as required by law.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Other than as indicated below under Interest Rate Risk , there have been no material changes to the Company's assessment of its sensitivity to market risks that affect the disclosures presented in the section entitled Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our Annual Report. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,289 million and 1,400 million in outstanding aggregate principal amount of issued variable rate and fixed rate debt, respectively. We are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt as changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. A 100 basis-points increase or decrease in interest rates would have an annualized pre-tax effect of approximately 33 million in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash Flows, based on current outstanding borrowings and effective interest rates on our variable rate debt. While our variable-rate debt may impact earnings and cash flows as a result of changes in effective interest rates, it is not subject to changes in fair value. The estimated fair value of our issued fixed rate debt as of September 30, 2024 was 1,477 million. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis-points, the fair value of our issued fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately 38 million. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis-points, the fair value of our issued fixed rate debt would increase by approximately 20 million. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act or under other applicable U.S. or Canadian securities laws or stock exchange rules is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

 56 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in legal proceedings from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Based on information currently available and established reserves, we have no reason to believe that the ultimate resolution of any known legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any such legal proceeding will be favorable, and adverse results in certain of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations in any one reporting period, or liquidity.
