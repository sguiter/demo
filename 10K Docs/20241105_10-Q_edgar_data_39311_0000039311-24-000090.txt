 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Statements in this report that are not statements of historical fact, including statements that include terms such as will, may, should, believe, expect, forecast, anticipate, estimate, project, intend, likely, optimistic and plan and statements about future or projected financial and operating results, plans, projections, objectives, expectations, and intentions, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, descriptions of plans and objectives for future operations, products or services; projections of our future revenue, earnings or other measures of economic performance; forecasts of credit losses and other asset quality trends; statements about our business and growth strategies; and expectations about economic and market conditions and trends. These forward-looking statements express our current expectations, forecasts of future events, or long-term goals. They are based on assumptions, estimates, and forecasts that, although believed to be reasonable, may turn out to be incorrect. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including: 
 economic, market, operational, liquidity, credit, and interest rate risks associated with our business; 
 economic conditions generally and in the financial services industry, particularly economic conditions within Michigan and the regional and local real estate markets in which our bank operates; 
 the failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of, and provisions made to, our allowance for credit losses; 
 increased competition in the financial services industry, either nationally or regionally; 
 our ability to achieve loan and deposit growth; 
 volatility and direction of market interest rates; 
 the continued services of our management team; and 
 implementation of new legislation, which may have significant effects on us and the financial services industry. 
 This list provides examples of factors that could affect the results described by forward-looking statements contained in this report, but the list is not intended to be all-inclusive. The risk factors disclosed in Part I Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as updated by any new or modified risk factors disclosed in Part II Item 1A of any subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, include the known risks our management believes could materially affect the results described by forward-looking statements in this report. However, those risks may not be the only risks we face. Our results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and prospects could also be materially and adversely affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us that we currently consider to be immaterial, or that develop after the date of this report. We cannot assure you that our future results will meet expectations. While we believe the forward-looking statements in this report are reasonable, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. In addition, these statements speak only as of the date made. We do not undertake, and expressly disclaim, any obligation to update or alter any statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

 Securities AFS in unrealized loss positions are evaluated quarterly for impairment related to credit losses. For securities AFS in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities AFS that do not meet this criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, adverse conditions specifically related to the security and the issuer and the impact of changes in market interest rates on the market value of the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an ACL is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. ACL for securities AFS was needed at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Accrued interest receivable on securities AFS totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,

 U.S. agency, U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed and U.S. agency commercial mortgage-backed securities whose fair value is less than amortized cost. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major credit rating agencies, and have a long history of no credit losses. The unrealized losses are largely attributed to widening spreads to Treasury bonds and/or an increase in interest rates since acquisition. 
 Private label mortgage backed, other asset backed and corporate securities at September 30, 2024, we had private label mortgage backed, other asset backed, and corporate securities whose fair value is less than amortized cost. The unrealized losses are primarily due to credit spread widening and/or an increase in interest rates since acquisition. 
 Obligations of states and political subdivisions at September 30, 2024, we had municipal securities whose fair value is less than amortized cost. The unrealized losses are primarily due to an increase in interest rates since acquisition. 
 Trust preferred securities at September 30, 2024, we had trust preferred security whose fair value is less than amortized cost. This trust preferred security is a single issue security issued by a trust subsidiary of a bank holding company. The pricing of trust preferred securities has suffered from credit spread widening. This security is rated by a major rating agency as investment grade. 
 At September 30, 2024 management does not intend to liquidate any of the securities discussed above and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of these unrealized losses. 
 We recorded credit related charges in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations related to securities AFS during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The ACL on securities HTM is a contra asset valuation account that is deducted from the carrying amount of securities HTM to present the net amount expected to be collected. Securities HTM are charged off against the ACL when deemed uncollectible. Adjustments to the ACL are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in provision for credit losses. We measure expected credit losses on securities HTM on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and we consider historical credit loss information. Accrued interest receivable on securities HTM totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses and is included in accrued income and other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. With regard to U.S. Government-sponsored agency and mortgage-backed securities (residential and commercial), all these securities are issued by a U.S. government-sponsored entity and have an implicit or explicit government guarantee; therefore, allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to obligations of states and political subdivisions, private label-mortgage-backed, corporate and trust preferred securities HTM, we consider (1) issuer bond ratings, (2) long-term historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (3) the financial condition of the issuer, and (4) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. Historical loss rates associated with securities having similar grades as those in our portfolio have been insignificant. During the first quarter of 2023, corporate security (Signature Bank) defaulted resulting in a million provision for credit losses and a corresponding full charge-off. Subsequent to this security's charge-off, a portion of its fair value had recovered and was subsequently sold during the first quarter of 2024 for million during which period we recorded that amount as a recovery to the ACL. Despite this lone security loss, the long-term historical loss rates associated with securities having similar grades as those in our portfolio have been insignificant. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no past due principal and interest payments associated with these securities. At those same dates an allowance for credit losses of and , respectively was recorded on non U.S. agency securities HTM based on applying the long-term historical cred it loss rate, as published by credit rating agencies, for similarly rated securities.

 Of the loans modified during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are on non-accrual status totaling million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were troubled loan modifications or subsequent defaults. 
 A loan is generally considered to be in payment default once it is days contractually past due under the modified terms for commercial loans and installment loans and when four consecutive payments are missed for mortgage loans. 
 In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, we perform an evaluation of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy. 
 Credit Quality Indicators As part of our on-going monitoring of the credit quality of our loan portfolios, we track certain credit quality indicators including (a) risk grade of commercial loans, (b) the level of classified commercial loans, (c) credit scores of mortgage and installment loan borrowers, and (d) delinquency history and non-performing loans. 
 For commercial loans, we use a loan rating system that is similar to those employed by state and federal banking regulators. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 12. A description of the general characteristics of the ratings follows: 
 Rating 1 through 6 : These loans are generally referred to as our non-watch commercial credits that include very high or exceptional credit fundamentals through acceptable credit fundamentals. 
 Rating 7 and 8 : These loans are generally referred to as our watch commercial credits. These ratings include loans to borrowers that exhibit potential credit weakness or downward trends. If not checked or cured these trends could weaken our asset or credit position. While potentially weak, no loss of principal or interest is envisioned with these ratings. 
 Rating 9 : These loans are generally referred to as our substandard accruing commercial credits. This rating includes loans to borrowers that exhibit a well-defined weakness where payment default is probable and loss is possible if deficiencies are not corrected. Generally, loans with this rating are considered collectible as to both principal and interest primarily due to collateral coverage. 
 Rating 10 and 11 : These loans are generally referred to as our substandard - non-accrual and doubtful commercial credits. These ratings include loans to borrowers with weaknesses that make collection of the loan in full, on the basis of current facts, conditions and values at best questionable and at worst improbable. All of these loans are placed in non-accrual. 
 Rating 12 : These loans are generally referred to as our loss commercial credits. This rating includes loans to borrowers that are deemed incapable of repayment and are charged-off.

 We have established management objectives and strategies that include interest-rate risk parameters for maximum fluctuations in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity. We monitor our interest rate risk position via simulation modeling reports. The goal of our asset/liability management efforts is to maintain profitable financial leverage within established risk parameters. 
 
 We have entered into pay-fixed interest rate swaps and caps to protect a portion of the fair value of a certain fixed rate commercial loan and certain mortgage and installment loans Fair Value Hedge Portfolio Loans ). As a result, changes in the fair values of the pay-fixed interest rate swaps and caps are expected to offset changes in the fair values of the fixed rate portfolio loans due to fluctuations in interest rates. We record the fair values of Fair Value Hedge Portfolio Loans in accrued income and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The hedged items (a fixed rate commercial loan and certain fixed rate mortgage and installment loans) are also recorded at fair value which offsets the adjustment to the Fair Value Hedge Portfolio Loans. On an ongoing basis, we adjust our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition to reflect the then current fair values of both the Fair Value Hedge Portfolio Loans and the hedged items. The related gains or losses are reported in interest income interest and fees on loans in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the second quarter of 2023 we terminated the interest rate cap that was previously hedging certain installment loans. The remaining unrealized gain on this terminated interest cap is being amortized into earnings over the original life of the interest rate cap.

 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into rate-lock mortgage loan commitments with customers Rate-Lock Commitments ). These commitments expose us to interest rate risk. We also enter into mandatory commitments to sell mortgage loans Mandatory Commitments to reduce the impact of price fluctuations of mortgage loans held for sale and Rate-Lock Commitments. Mandatory Commitments help protect our loan sale profit margin from fluctuations in interest rates. The changes in the fair value of Rate-Lock Commitments and Mandatory Commitments are recognized currently as part of net gains on mortgage loans in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We obtain market prices on Mandatory Commitments and Rate-Lock Commitments. Net gains on mortgage loans, as well as net income may be more volatile as a result of these derivative instruments, which are not designated as hedges. 
 We have a program that allows commercial loan customers to lock in a fixed rate for a longer period of time than we would normally offer for interest rate risk reasons. We will enter into a variable rate commercial loan and an interest rate swap agreement with a customer and then enter into an offsetting interest rate swap agreement with an unrelated party. The interest rate swap agreement fair values will generally move in opposite directions resulting in little or no net impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. All of the interest rate swap agreements - commercial in the table above with no hedge designation relate to this program.

Our actual federal income tax expense is different than the amount computed by applying our statutory income tax rate to our income before income tax primarily due to tax-exempt interest income and tax-exempt income from the increase in the cash surrender value on life insurance. In addition, the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2024 include reductions of million and million, respectively of income tax expense related to the impact of the excess value of stock awards that vested and stock options that were exercised as compared to the initial fair values that were expensed.

 We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard.

 million. It is not our intent to have dividends paid in amounts that would reduce the capital of our Bank to levels below those which we consider prudent or that would not be in accordance with guidelines of regulatory authorities. 
 We are also subject to various regulatory capital requirements. The prompt corrective action regulations establish quantitative measures to ensure capital adequacy and require minimum amounts and ratios of total, Tier 1, and common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to average assets. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly discretionary, actions by regulators that could have a material effect on our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, capital adequacy rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of of risk-weighted assets that applies to all supervised financial institutions. To avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments we must meet the minimum ratio for adequately capitalized institutions plus the buffer. Under capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures as well as qualitative judgments by the regulators. The most recent regulatory filings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, categorized our Bank as well capitalized and exceeding the minimum ratio for adequately capitalized institutions plus the capital conservation buffer. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would have changed the most recent Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC categorization.

 shares of Visa Inc. Class B-1 common stock (all of the Class B-1 shares we owned) for shares of Visa Inc. Class C common stock and shares of Visa Inc. Class B-2 common stock pursuant to an exchange offer conducted by Visa. Each Class C share automatically converts to shares of Visa Inc. Class A common stock upon a transfer to anyone other than a Visa member or an affiliate of a Visa member. The Class B-2 shares have the same transfer restrictions as the transfer restrictions on the Class B-1 shares and can only be sold to other Class B shareholders. 
 Because of the very limited liquidity for the Class B-1 shares (prior to completion of the exchange offer) and uncertainty regarding the likelihood, ultimate timing, and eventual exchange rate for Class B-1 shares into Class A shares, we were carrying these shares at zero, representing cost basis less impairment. In light of the continued uncertainty regarding the likelihood, ultimate timing, and eventual exchange rate for Class B-2 shares into Class A shares, we are carrying the Class B-2 shares at zero, representing cost basis less impairment. 
 With the completion of the exchange, we recorded a gain related to the Class C shares of million during the second quarter of 2024 based on the conversion privilege of those shares and the closing price of the Class A shares on May 3, 2024 (the exchange expiration date) of per share. Subsequent to the exchange, we sold all shares of our Class C shares for net proceeds of million. We held Class C shares at September 30, 2024. 
 As a condition to our participation in the exchange offer, we were required to enter into a Makewhole Agreement that will require us to reimburse Visa in certain circumstances if certain litigation in which Visa has been involved since 2008 results in damages significantly higher than Visa currently expects. Potential payments under the Makewhole Agreement are designed to equal the decline in value we would have experienced had we not participated in Visa s exchange offer. Based on the disclosures that have been made by Visa regarding the status of this litigation and other circumstances

 Service charges on deposit accounts and other deposit related income : Revenues are earned on depository accounts for commercial and retail customers and include fees for transaction-based, account maintenance and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees, which includes services such as ATM use fees, stop payment charges and ACH fees are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the time we fulfill our customer s request. Account maintenance fees, which includes monthly maintenance services are earned over the course of a month representing the period over which the performance obligation is satisfied. Our obligation for overdraft services is satisfied at the time of the overdraft. 
 Interchange income : Interchange income primarily includes debit card interchange and network revenues. Debit card interchange and network revenues are earned on debit card transactions conducted through payment networks such as MasterCard and Accel. Interchange income is recognized concurrently with the delivery of services on a daily basis. Interchange and network revenues are presented gross of interchange expenses, which are presented separately as a component of non-interest expense. 
 Investment and insurance commissions : Investment and insurance commissions include fees and commissions from asset management, custody, recordkeeping, investment advisory and other services provided to our customers. Revenue is recognized on an accrual basis at the time the services are performed and generally based on either the market value of the assets managed or the services provided. We have an agent relationship with a third party provider of these services and net certain direct costs charged by the third party provider associated with providing these services to our customers. 
 Net (gains) losses on other real estate and repossessed assets : We record a gain or loss from the sale of other real estate when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. If we were to finance the sale of other real estate to the buyer, we would assess whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligations under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction is probable. Once these criteria are met, the other real estate asset would be derecognized and the gain or loss on sale would be recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer. There were other real estate properties sold during the nine month periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023 that were financed by us.

 Introduction . The following section presents additional information to assess the financial condition and results of operations of Independent Bank Corporation IBCP ), its wholly-owned bank, Independent Bank (the Bank ), and their subsidiaries. This section should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We also encourage you to read our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). That report includes a list of risk factors that you should consider in connection with any decision to buy or sell our securities. 
 Overview . We provide banking services to customers located primarily in Michigan s Lower Peninsula. We also have a loan production office in Fairlawn, Ohio. As a result, our success depends to a great extent upon the economic conditions in Michigan s Lower Peninsula. 
 
 Recent Developments. Pressures from various global and national macroeconomic conditions, including heightened inflation, uncertainty regarding future interest rates, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, recent adverse weather conditions, the continuation of the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East wars, the pending Presidential and Congressional elections, and potential governmental responses to these events, continue to create significant economic uncertainty. The extent to which these pressures may impact our business, results of operations, asset valuations, financial condition, and customers will depend on future developments, which continue to be highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Material adverse impacts may include all or a combination of valuation impairments on our intangible assets, securities available for sale ("AFS"), securities held to maturity ("HTM"), loans, capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights or deferred tax assets. 
 
 It is against this backdrop that we discuss our results of operations and financial condition for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to earlier periods. 
 
 R ESULTS OF O PERATIONS 
 
 Summary. We recorded net income of 13.8 million and 17.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in 2024 third quarter results as compared to 2023 is due primarily to a 5.7 unfavorable change in the fair value due to price of capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights that was partially offset by a 2.4 million increase in net interest income. 
 We recorded net income of 48.3 million and 45.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 year-to-date results as compared to 2023 is primarily due to an increase in net-interest income and a decrease in the provision for credit losses that were partially offset by increases in non-interest expense and income tax expense and a decrease in non-interest income. 
 Key performance ratios Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (annualized) to Average assets 1.04 1.34 1.24 1.19 Average shareholders equity 12.54 18.68 15.42 16.62 Net income per common share Basic 0.66 0.84 2.31 2.16 Diluted 0.65 0.83 2.29 2.14 

Net interest income. Net interest income is the most important source of our earnings and thus is critical in evaluating our results of operations. Changes in our net interest income are primarily influenced by our level of interest-earning assets and 
 66 

Index 

 the income or yield that we earn on those assets and the manner and cost of funding our interest-earning assets. Certain m acro-economic factors can also influence our net interest income such as the level and direction of interest rates, the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates (the steepness of the yield curve) and the general strength of the economies in which we are doing business. Finally, risk management plays an important role in our level of net interest income. The ineffective management of credit risk and interest-rate risk in particular can adversely impact our net interest income. 
 Our net interest income totaled 41.9 million during the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 2.4 million, or 6.2 from the year-ago period. This increase primarily reflects a 93.6 million increase in average interest-earning assets and a 14 basis point increase in our tax equivalent net interest income as a percent of average interest-earning assets (the net interest margin ). 
 For the first nine months of 2024, net interest income totaled 123.4 million, an increase of 7.2 million, or 6.2 from 2023. This increase primarily reflects a 145.3 million, or 3.0 increase in average interest-earning assets and a nine basis point increase in our net interest margin. 
 The increase in average interest-earning assets in both the three and nine month periods in 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily reflects growth in commercial and mortgage loans funded from a decrease in securities available for sale and an increase in deposits. 
 The increases in our net interest margin during the three and nine month periods in 2024 is attributed to increases in interest income as a percent of average interest-earning assets ("Asset Yield") that were only partially offset by increases in interest expense as a percent of average interest-earning assets ("Cost of Funds"). These increases are primarily attributed to the increases in the federal funds rate since January of 2023. Our Asset Yield has been positively impacted by new loans being originated at higher rates than existing loans being paid off as well as a shift in earning asset mix from generally lower rate investment securities to higher rate loans while our Cost of Funds has been negatively impacted by changes in funding mix (such as shifting from non-interest bearing deposits to interest-bearing deposits and an increase in time deposits) as well as higher deposit pricing sensitivity to the increases in interest rates discussed above. This change in funding mix and pricing is expected to continue to impact our Cost of Funds during the fourth quarter of 2024. See Asset/liability management. 
 Our net interest income is also impacted by our level of non-accrual loans. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, non-accrual loans averaged 4.5 million and 4.1 million, respectively. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, non-accrual loans averaged 4.4 million and 4.0 million, respectively. In addition, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 we had net recoveries of 0.12 million and 0.51 million, respectively of unpaid interest on loans placed on or taken off non-accrual or on loans previously charged-off compared to net recoveries of 0.09 million and 0.47 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2023.

 Provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses was an expense of 1.49 million and an expense of 1.35 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the provision for credit losses was an expense of 2.25 million and a expense of 6.83 million, respectively. The provision reflects our assessment of the allowance for credit losses (the ACL taking into consideration factors such as loan growth, loan mix, levels of non-performing and classified loans, economic conditions and loan net charge-offs. While we use relevant information to recognize losses on loans, additional provisions for related losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, customer circumstances and other credit risk factors. See Portfolio Loans and asset quality for a discussion of the various components of the ACL and their impact on the provision for credit losses in 2024. 
 The year-to-date provision for credit losses on loans in 2024 compared to 2023, decreased 0.44 million. The provision for credit losses on securities HTM in 2024 and 2023 was an expense (credit) of (1.15) million and 2.99 million, respectively. The change in provision for credit losses on securities HTM reflects a charge-off in the first quarter of 2023 and a subsequent partial recovery during the first quarter of 2024 of one corporate security (Signature Bank). See Securities below and note #3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Non-interest income. Non-interest income is a significant element in assessing our results of operations. Non-interest income totaled 9.5 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 15.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, non-interest income totaled 37.2 million compared to 41.6 million for the first nine months of 2023.

Mortgage loan sales during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 include 14.7 million and 41.2 million, respectively, of portfolio loan transactions. These transactions were performed for interest rate risk purposes. 
 Mortgage loans originated decreased in 2024 as compared to 2023 due primarily to higher mortgage loan interest rates in 2024 reducing this activity. Mortgage loans sold, excluding portfolio loan sales, were relative unchanged in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 The volume of loans sold is dependent upon our ability to originate mortgage loans as well as the demand for fixed-rate obligations and other loans that we choose to not put into portfolio because of our established interest-rate risk parameters. (See Portfolio Loans and asset quality. Net gains on mortgage loans are also dependent upon economic and competitive factors as well as our ability to effectively manage exposure to changes in interest rates and thus can often be a volatile part of our overall revenues.

Index 

 Net gains on mortgage loans totaled 2.2 million and 2.1 million during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 , respectively. For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, net gains on mortgage loans totaled 4.9 million and 5.5 million, respectively. T he decrea se from the prior year to date period was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage loans sold. 
 Our Loan Sales Margin is impacted by several factors including competition and the manner in which the loan is sold. Net gains on mortgage loans are also impacted by recording fair value accounting adjustments. Excluding these fair value accounting adjustments, the Loan Sales Margin would have been 1.40 and 2.14 in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.38 and 1.10 for the comparative 2024 and 2023 year-to-date periods, respectively. The decline in the Loan Sales Margin (excluding fair value adjustments) in the third quarter of 2024 was generally due to lower primary-to-secondary market pricing spreads as market interest rates rose in 2024 (relative to 2023) which were impacted by the decrease in salable mortgage loan volumes. 
 
 Gain on equity securities at fair value totaled 2.7 million during the first nine months of 2024. This gain is the consequence of the exchange of our shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock on May 6, 2024 into a combination of Visa Class C common stock and Visa Class B-2 common stock. With the completion of this exchange, we were able to sell our Visa Class C common stock (as it was convertible into publicly traded Visa Class A common stock) while the Visa Class B-2 common stock continues to be held and carried at zero. See note #13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We recorded a net loss o f 0.4 m illion and a net loss of 0.2 million on securities AFS for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded no credit related charges in either 2024 or 2023 on securities AFS. See Securities below and note #3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Mortgage loan servicing, net, generated income (expense) of (3.1) million and 2.7 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, mortgage loan servicing, net, generated income of 1.7 million and 7.1 million, respectively. The significant variances in mortgage loan servicing, net are primarily due to changes in the fair value of capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights associated with changes in interest rates and the associated expected future prepayment levels and expected float rates. 
 Mortgage loan servicing, net activity is summarized in the following table:

Index 

 At September 30, 2024 we were se rvicing approximately 3.55 billion in mortgage loans for others on which servicing rights have been capitalized. This servicing portfolio had a weighted average coupon rate of 4.08 and a weighted average service fee of approximately 25.5 basis points. Capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights at September 30, 2024 totaled 40.2 million, representing approximately 113.2 basis p oints on the related amount of mortgage loans serviced for others. 
 
 Other income in the table above decreased by 0.1 million and 0.8 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the prior year including a one time gain on the sale of an office building and a decrease in certain internet banking fees no longer being charged that were partially offset by higher commercial loan swap fees. T he decrea se from the prior year to date period was primarily due to the prior year including one time gains on the sale of an office building and a purchase credit impaired loan as well as a decrease in certain internet banking fees no longer being charged. 
 
 Non-interest expense. Non-interest expense is an important component of our results of operations. We strive to efficiently manage our cost structure. 
 Non-interest expense increased by 0.5 million to 32.6 million and increased by 2.9 mill ion to 98.1 m illion during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.

 Compensation and employee benefits expenses, in total, increased 0.1 million on a quarterly comparative basis and increased 2.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 73 

Index 

 Compensation exp ense increased by 0.2 million and 0.1 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. These comparative increases in 2024 were primarily due to salary increases that were predominantly effective on January 1, 2024 that were only partially offset by a decrease in mortgage lending and other retail personnel. 
 Performance-based compensation increased by 0.5 million and 2.4 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher expected incentive compensation payout for salaried and hourly employees. 
 Payroll taxes and employee benefits decreased by 0.6 million and 0.3 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases were primarily due to decreases in employee medical insurance costs and a mortgage loan origination related incentive due to lower loan volumes. 
 Data p rocessing expense increased by 0.3 million and 0.9 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods due in part to core data processor annual asset growth and CPI related cost increases as well as new solutions implemented during this time frame. 
 Advertising increased by 0.2 mill ion and 0.6 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods due primarily to modifications in strategic marketing spend as well as costs related to certain website redesign initiatives. 
 Taxes licenses and fees increased by 0.1 million and 0.2 m illio n in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to higher Michigan Corporate Income Tax expense as the result of an increase in tax base. 
 Costs (recoveries) related to unfunded lending commitments decreased by 0.3 million and 0.8 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively compared to the same prior year periods. These decreases are due to decreases in the changes to both the balance of lending commitments and the loss rates applied to those lending commitments. 
 
 Income tax expense. We recorded an income tax expense of 3.5 m illion and 11.9 mi llion in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, respectively. This compares to an income tax expense of 4.1 million and 10.4 million in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2023, respectively. The changes in expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 are primarily due to changes in pretax income. 
 Our actual income tax expense is different than the amount computed by applying our statutory income tax rate to our income before income tax primarily due to tax-exempt interest income, tax-exempt income from the increase in the cash surrender value on life insurance, and differences in the value of stock awards that vest and stock options that are exercised as compared to the initial fair values that were expensed. 
 We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard. The ultimate realization of this asset is primarily based on generating future income. We concluded at September 30, 2024 and 2023 and at December 31, 2023, that the realization of substantially all of our deferred tax assets continues to be more likely than not. 
 
 F INANCIAL C ONDITION 
 
 Summar y. Our total assets decreased by 4.5 million during the first nine months of 2024. Loans, excluding loans held for sale, were 3.94 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.79 billion at December 31, 2023. Commercial loans and mortgage loans each increased while installment loans decreased during the first nine months of 2024. (See Portfolio Loans and asset quality. Securities available for sale and securities held to maturity together totaled 932.3 million at September 30, 2024, a decline of 101.1 million since December 31, 2023. 
 Deposits tota led 4.63 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.0 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2023, is due to increases in savings and interest-bearing checking, reciprocal and time deposits that were partially off set by a decrease in non-interest bearing deposits as well as scheduled maturities of brokered time deposits. 
 
 Securities. We maintain diversified securities portfolios, which include obligations of U.S. government-sponsored agencies, securities issued by states and political subdivisions, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate securities, trust preferred securities and foreign government securities (that are 
 74 

Index 

 denominated in U.S. dollars). We regularly evaluate asset/liability management needs and attempt to maintain a portfolio structure that provides sufficient liquidity and cash flow. 
 We believe that the unrealized losses on securities AFS are temporary in nature and are expected to be recovered within a reasonable time period. Based upon our liquidity and capital resources (as explained in more detail below under "Liquidity and capital resources"), we believe that we have the ability and intent to hold securities with unrealized losses to maturity or until such time as the unrealized losses reverse.(See Asset/liability management. 
 On April 1, 2022, we transferred certain securities AFS with an amortized cost and unrealized loss at the date of transfer of 418.1 million and 26.5 million, respectively to securities HTM. The transfer was made at fair value, with the unrealized loss becoming part of the purchase discount which will be accreted over the remaining life of the securities. The other comprehensive loss component is separated from the remaining available for sale securities and is accreted over the remaining life of the securities transferred. Based upon our liquidity and capital resources (as explained in more detail below under "Liquidity and capital resources"), we believe that we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until they mature, at which time we would receive full value for these securities.

 (1) Represents the remaining unrealized loss to be accreted on securities that were transferred from AFS to HTM on April 1, 2022. 
 Securities AFS in unrealized loss positions are evaluated quarterly for impairment related to credit losses. For securities AFS in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities AFS that do not meet this criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, adverse conditions specifically related to the security and the issuer and the impact of changes in market interest rates on the market value of the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an ACL is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. No ACL for securities AFS was needed at September 30, 2024. The decrease in unrealized losses during the first nine months of 2024 is primarily attributed to lower interest rates, pay downs of security balances, par reversion and the narrowing of certain interest rate spreads. See note #3 to the Condensed Consol idated Financial Statements included within this report for further discussion. 
 For securities HTM an ACL is maintained at a level which represents our best estimate of expected credit losses. This ACL is a contra asset valuation account that is deducted from the carrying amount of securities HTM to present the net amount 
 75 

Index 

 expected to be collected. Securities HTM are charged off against the ACL when deemed uncollectible. Adjustments to the ACL are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in provision for credit loss. We measure expected credit losses on securities HTM on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics. With regard to U.S. Government-sponsored agency and mortgage-backed securities (residential and commercial), all these securities are issued by a U.S. government-sponsored entity and have an implicit or explicit government guarantee; therefore, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to obligations of states and political subdivisions, private label-mortgage-backed, corporate and trust preferred securities HTM, we consider (1) issuer bond ratings, (2) long-term historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (3) the financial condition of the issuer, and (4) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. During the first quarter of 2023, one corporate security (Signature Bank) defaulted resulting in a 3.0 million provision for credit losses and a corresponding full charge-off. Subsequent to this security's charge-off, a portion of its fair value had recovered and was subsequently sold during the first quarter of 2024 for 1.1 million during which period we recorded that amount as a recovery to the ACL. See note #3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report for further discussion.

Class B-2 common stock pursuant to an exchange offer conducted by Visa. With the completion of the exchange, we recorded a gain related to the Class C shares of 2.677 million based on the conversion privilege of those shares and the closing price of the Class A shares on May 3, 2024 (the exchange expiration date) of 268.49 per share. Subsequent to the exchange, we sold all of our Class C shares for net proceeds of 2.685 million. See note #13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report for further discussion. 
 
 Portfolio Loans and asset quality. In addition to the communities served by our Bank branch and loan production office network, our principal lending markets also include nearby communities and metropolitan areas. Subject to established underwriting criteria, we also may participate in commercial lending transactions with certain non-affiliated banks and make whole loan purchases from other financial institutions. 
 The senior management and board of directors of our Bank retain authority and responsibility for credit decisions and we have adopted uniform underwriting standards. Our loan committee structure and the loan review process attempt to provide requisite controls and promote compliance with such established underwriting standards. However, there can be no assurance that our lending procedures and the use of uniform underwriting standards will prevent us from incurring significant credit losses in our lending activities. 
 We generally retain loans that may be profitably funded within established risk parameters. (See Asset/liability management. As a result, we may hold adjustable-rate and fixed rate jumbo mortgage loans as Portfolio Loans, while 15- and 30-year fixed-ra te conforming mortgage loans are generally sold to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. (See Non-interest income. The growth in mortgage loans during the first nine months of 2024 has primarily been attributed to the origination of adjustable-rate mortgage loans and advances on adjustable rate construction mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. (See Asset/liability management. ).

 Non-performing loans have declined modestly as a percent of Portfolio Loans since year-end 2023, reflecting our ongoing collection efforts. Our collection and resolution efforts have generally resulted in a positive trend in non-performing loans. 
 Other real estate and repossessed assets total ed 0.78 m illion and 0.57 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We will place a loan that is 90 days or more past due on non-accrual, unless we believe the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Accordingly, we have determined that the collection of the accrued and unpaid interest on any loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest is probable.

 Some loans will not be repaid in full. Therefore, an ACL on loans is maintained at a level which represents our best estimate of expected credit losses. Our ACL on loans is comprised of three principal elements: (i) specific analysis of individual loans identified during the review of the loan portfolio, (ii) pooled analysis of loans with similar risk characteristics based on historical experience, adjusted for current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and expected prepayments, and (iii) additional allowances based on subjective factors, including local and general economic business factors and trends, portfolio concentrations and changes in the size and/or the general terms of the loan portfolios. See note #4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report for further discussion on the ACL on loans. 
 While we use relevant information to recognize losses on loans, additional provisions for related losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, customer circumstances and other credit risk factors. 
 The ACL increased 2.8 million to 57.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 54.7 million at December 31, 2023, and was equal to 1.46 and 1.44 of total Portfolio Loans at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Since December 31, 2023, the ACL related to specific loans increased 1.2 million due primarily to one commercial loan addition during the first quarter of 2024. The ACL related to pooled analysis of loans and subjective factors increased 1.1 million and 0.5 million, respectively due primarily to loan growth. 
 
 Deposits and borrowings. Historically, the loyalty of our customer base has allowed us to price deposits competitively, contributing to a net interest margin that generally compares favorably to our peers. However, we still face a significant amount of competition for deposits within many of the markets served by our branch network, which limits our ability to materially increase deposits without adversely impacting the weighted-average cost of core deposits. 
 78 

Index 

 To attract new core deposits, we have implemented various account acquisition strategies as well as branch staff sales training. Account acquisition initiatives have historically generated increases in customer relationships. Over the past several years, we have also expanded our treasury management products and services for commercial businesses and municipalities or other governmental units and have also increased our sales calling efforts in order to attract additional deposit relationships from these sectors. We view long-term core deposit growth as an important objective. Core deposits generally provide a more stable and lower cost source of funds than alternative sources such as short-term borrowings. (See Liquidity and capital resources. 
 Deposits totaled 4.63 billion and 4.62 billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in deposits is primarily due to increases in savings and interest-bearing checking, reciprocal and time deposits that were partially off set by a decrease in non-interest bearing deposits as well as scheduled maturities of brokered time deposits. R eciprocal deposits totaled 995.5 million and 832.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These deposits represent demand, money market and time deposits from our customers that have been placed through IntraFi Network. This service allows our customers to access multi-million dollar FDIC deposit insurance on deposit balances greater than the standard FDIC insurance maximum. 
 We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain our current level of core deposits. In particular, those deposits that are uninsured may be susceptible to outflow . Data relating t o our deposit portfolios (excluding brokered time) f ollows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Uninsured deposits (1) 1,056,791 961,974 Uninsured deposits as a percentage of deposits 23.0 22.2 Average deposit account size 21.91 20.38 Balance of top 100 largest depositors 1,144,474 890,289 Balance of top 100 depositors as a percentage of deposits, excluding brokered time deposits 
 24.9 20.5 
 (1) These amounts exclude intercompany related deposits of 51.8 million and 51.2 million respectively. Uninsured deposits reported in our Call Report at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 totaled 1,108.6 million and 1,013.2 million, respectively. 
 We have also implemented strategies that incorporate using federal funds purchased, other borrowings and Brokered CDs to fund a portion of our interest-earning assets. The use of such alternate sources of funds supplements our core deposits and is also an integral part of our asset/liability management efforts. 
 Other borrowings, historically comprising primarily of FRB and FHLB borrowings, totaled zero and 50.0 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As described above, we have utilized wholesale funding, including federal funds purchased, FHLB and FRB borrowings and Brokered CDs to augment our core deposits and fund a portion of our assets. At September 30, 2024, our use of such wholesale funding sources (including reciprocal deposits) amounted to approxim ately 1.04 billion, or 22.4 of total funding (deposits and all borrowings, excluding subordinated debt and debentures). Because wholesale funding sources are affected by general market conditions, the availability of such funding may be dependent on the confidence these sources have in our financial condition and operations. The continued availability to us of these funding sources is not certain, and Brokered CDs may be difficult for us to retain or replace at attractive rates as they mature. Our liquidity may be constrained if we are unable to renew our wholesale funding sources or if adequate financing is not available in the future at acceptable rates of interest or at all. Our financial performance could also be affected if we are unable to maintain our access to funding sources or if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources. In such case, our net interest income and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 We historically employed derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. During the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we enter ed into 136.0 million and 92.9 million (aggregate notional amounts), respectively, of interest rate swaps with commercial loan customers, which were offset with interest rate swaps that the Bank entered into with a broker-dealer. We recorded 1.52 million and 1.46 million of fee income related to these transactions during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respective ly. See note #6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report for more information on our derivative financial instruments.

 Liquidity and capital resources. Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to timely meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost or without incurring unacceptable losses. Our liquidity management involves the measurement and monitoring of a variety of sources and uses of funds. Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows categorize these sources and uses into operating, investing and financing activities. We primarily focus our liquidity management on maintaining adequate levels of liquid assets (primarily funds on deposit with the FRB and certain securities AFS) as well as developing access to a variety of borrowing sources to supplement our deposit gathering activities and provide funds for purchasing securities or originating Portfolio Loans as well as to be able to respond to unforeseen liquidity needs. 
 Our primary sources of funds include our deposit base, secured advances from the FHLB and FRB, federal funds purchased, borrowing facilities with o ther banks, and access to the capital markets (for Brokered CDs). At September 30, 2024, in addition to liquidity available from our normal operating, funding and investing activities we had unused credit lines with the FHLB and FRB of approximately 1.111 billion and 471.7 million, respectively. We also had approximately 771.3 million in fair value of unpledged securities AFS and HTM at September 30, 2024, which could be pledged for an estimated additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRB of approximately 718.0 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 698.5 million of time deposits that mature in the next 12 months. Historically, a majority of these maturing time deposits are renewed by our cus tomers. Additionally, 3.85 billion of our deposits at September 30, 2024, were in account types from which the customer could withdraw the funds on demand. Changes in the balances of deposits that can be withdrawn upon demand are usually predictable and the total ba lances of these accounts have generally grown or have been stable over time as a result of our marketing and promotional activities. However, there can be no assurance that historical patterns of renewing time deposits or overall growth or stability in deposits will continue in the future. 
 We have developed contingency funding plans that stress test our liquidity needs that may arise from certain events such as an adverse change in our financial metrics (for example, credit quality or regulatory capital ratios). Our liquidity management also includes periodic monitoring that measures quick assets (defined generally as highly liquid or short-term assets) to total assets, short-term liability dependence and basic surplus (defined as quick assets less volatile liabilities to total assets). Policy limits have been established for our various liquidity measurements and are monitored on a quarterly basis. In addition, we also prepare cash flow forecasts that include a variety of different scenarios. 
 We believe that we currently have adequate liquidity at our Bank because of our cash and cash equivalents, our portfolio of securities AFS, our access to secured advances from the FHLB and FRB and our ability to issue Brokered CDs. 
 We also believe that the available cash on hand at the parent company including time deposits) of approximately 47.0 million as of September 30, 2024, provides sufficient liquidity resources at the parent company to meet operating expenses, to make interest payments on the subordinated debt and debentures, and, along with dividends from the Bank, to pay projected cash dividends on our common stock. 
 Effective management of capital resources is critical to our mission to create value for our shareholders. In addition to common stock, our capital structure also currently includes subordinated debt and cumulative trust preferred securities.

 In May 2020, we issued 40.0 million of fixed to floating subordinated notes with a ten year maturity and a five year call option. The initial coupon rate is 5.95 fixed for five years and then floats at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 5.825 . These notes are presented in the Conden sed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition under the caption Subordinated debt and the September 30, 2024, balance of 39.6 million is net of remaining unamortized deferred issuance costs of approximately 0.4 million that are being amortized through the maturity date into interest expense on other borrowings and subordinated debt and debentures in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 We currently have four special purpose entities wit h 39.8 million of outstanding cumulative trust preferred securities as of September 30, 2024. These special purpose entities issued common securities and provided cash to our parent company that in turn issued subordinated debentures to these special purpose entities equal to the trust preferred securities and common securities. The subordinated debentures represent the sol e asset of the special purpose entities. The common securities and subordinated debentures are included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 The FRB has issued rules regarding trust preferred securities as a component of the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies. The aggregate amount of trust preferred securities (and certain other capital elements) are limited to 25 percent of Tier 1 capital elements, net of goodwill (net of any associated deferred tax liability). The amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit can be included in Tier 2 capital, subject to restrictions. At the parent company, all of these securities qualified as Tier 1 capital at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 Common shareholders equity increased to 452.4 million at September 30, 2024, from 404.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to earnings retention and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Our tangible common equity TCE totaled 422.5 million and 374.1 million, respectively, at those same dates. Our ratio of TCE to tangible assets was 8.08 and 7.15 at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. TCE and the ratio of TCE to tangible assets are non-GAAP measures. TCE represents total common equity less goodwill and other intangible assets. 
 In December 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a 2024 share repurchase plan. Under the terms of the 2024 share repurchase plan, we are authorized to buy back up to 1,100,000, or approximately 5 of our outstanding common stock. There we re no sha res repurchased during the first nine months of 2024. During the first nine months of 2023, we repurchased 288,401 shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of 5.0 million . 
 We currently pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. These dividends totaled 0.72 per share and 0.69 per share in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. We generally favor a dividend payout ratio between 30 and 50 of net income. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Bank (and holding company) continued to meet the requirements to be considered well-capitalized under federal regulatory standards (also see note #10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report). 
 
 Asset/liability management. Interest-rate risk is created by differences in the cash flow characteristics of our assets and liabilities. Options embedded in certain financial instruments, including caps on adjustable-rate loans as well as borrowers rights to prepay fixed-rate loans, also create interest-rate risk. 
 Our asset/liability management efforts identify and evaluate opportunities to structure our assets and liabilities in a manner that is consistent with our mission to maintain profitable financial leverage within established risk parameters. We evaluate various opportunities and alternate asset/liability management strategies carefully and consider the likely impact on our risk profile as well as the anticipated contribution to earnings. The marginal cost of funds is a principal consideration in the implementation of our asset/liability management strategies, but such evaluations further consider interest-rate and liquidity risk as well as other pertinent factors. We have established parameters for interest-rate risk. We regularly monitor our interest-rate risk and report at least quarterly to our board of directors. 
 We employ simulation analyses to monitor our interest-rate risk profile and evaluate potential changes in our net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that result from changes in interest rates. The purpose of these simulations is to identify sources of interest-rate risk. The simulations do not anticipate any actions that we might initiate in response to changes in interest rates and, accordingly, the simulations do not provide a reliable forecast of anticipated results. The simulations are predicated on immediate, permanent and parallel shifts in interest rates and generally assume that current loan and deposit pricing relationships remain constant. The simulations further incorporate assumptions relating to changes in customer behavior, including changes in prepayment rates on certain assets and liabilities. At September 30, 2024, our interest rate risk profile as measured by our longer term interest rate risk measure based on changes in economic value 
 81 

Index 

 indicates exposure to rising rates. This measure has decreased modestly from December 31, 2023 due to a decline in asset duration, an increase in liability duration and a higher base value. Asset duration declined given a shift in the asset mix to shorter duration loans. The increase in liability duration is due to modestly lower betas on some non-maturity deposit accounts and a favorable shift in deposit mix with a decline in low duration brokered time deposits combined with growth in higher duration deposits. In addition, at September 30, 2024 our simulation base-rate scenario for market value of portfolio equity increased from December 31, 2023 due primarily to an increase in the Bank s tangible equity and an improvement in asset values given a decline in interest rates. We are carefully monitoring the change in our funding mix as well as the composition of our earning assets and the impact of potential future changes in interest rates on our changes in market value of portfolio equity and changes in net interest income. As a result, we may add some longer-term borrowings, may utilize derivatives (interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and interest rate floors) and may continue to sell some fixed rate jumbo and other portfolio mortgage loans in the future.

 (1) Simulation analyses calculate the change in the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including debt and related financial derivative instruments, under parallel shifts in interest rates by discounting the estimated future cash flows using a market-based discount rate. Cash flow estimates incorporate anticipated changes in prepayment speeds and other embedded options. 
 (2) Simulation analyses calculate the change in net interest income under immediate parallel shifts in interest rates over the next twelve months, based upon a static statement of financial condition, which includes debt and related financial derivative instruments, and do not consider loan fees or loan origination costs.

 L ITIGATION M ATTERS 
 The aggregate amount we have accrued for losses we consider probable as a result of litigation matters is immaterial. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of outcomes from any litigation matter, we believe it is reasonably possible we may incur losses in addition to the amounts we have accrued. At this time, we estimate the maximum amount of additional losses that are reasonably possible is insignificant. However, because of a number of factors, including the fact that certain of these litigation matters are still in their early stages, this maximum amount may change in the future. 
 82 

Index 

 The litigation matters described in the preceding paragraph primarily include claims that have been brought against us for damages, but do not include litigation matters where we seek to collect amounts owed to us by third parties (such as litigation initiated to collect delinquent loans). These excluded, collection-related matters may involve claims or counterclaims by the opposing party or parties, but we have excluded such matters from the disclosure contained in the preceding paragraph in all cases where we believe the possibility of us paying damages to any opposing party is remote. 
 
 Accounting standards update. See note #2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for details on recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact on our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Fair valuation of financial instruments. Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures FASB ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. 
 We utilize fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. FASB ASC Topic 820 differentiates between those assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value at every reporting period recurring and those assets and liabilities that are only required to be adjusted to fair value under certain circumstances nonrecurring ). Equity securities at fair value, securities AFS, loans held for sale, carried at fair value, derivatives and capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held for investment and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets. See note #11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report for a complete discussion on our use of fair valuation of financial instruments and the related measurement techniques. 
 
 C RITICAL A CCOUNTING P OLICIES 
 Our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Accounting and reporting policies for the ACL and capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights are deemed critical since they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. Application of assumptions different than those that we have used could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or results of operations. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 The Company maintains a Deferred Compensation and Stock Purchase Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Plan") pursuant to which non-employee directors can elect to receive shares of the Company's common stock in lieu of fees otherwise payable to the director for his or her service as a director. A director can elect to receive shares on a current basis or to defer receipt of the shares, in which case the shares are issued to a trust to be held for the account of the director and then generally distributed to the director after his or her retirement from the Board. Pursuant to this Plan, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company issued 343 shares of common stock to non-employee directors on a current basis and 1,802 shares of common stock to the trust for distribution to directors on a deferred basis. These shares were issued on July 1, 2024 representing aggregate fees of 0.05 million. The shares on a current basis were issued at a price of 27.00 per share and the shares on a deferred basis were issued at a price of 24.30 per share, representing 90 of the fair value of the shares on the credit date. The price per share was the consolidated closing bid price per share of the Company's common stock as of the date of issuance, as determined in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. The Company issued the shares pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 due to the fact that the issuance of the shares was made on a private basis pursuant to the Plan. 
 The following table shows certain information relating to repurchases of common stock for the three-months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Period Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of a Publicly Announced Plan Remaining Number of Shares Authorized for Purchase Under the Plan July 2024 242 31.35 1,100,000 August 2024 101 33.88 1,100,000 September 2024 1,100,000 Total 343 32.10 1,100,000
