per share (the Common Stock ), confers upon the holders the right to receive notice to participate
and vote in general meetings of the Company, the right to receive dividends, if declared, and to participate in the distribution of the

Reverse
stock split 

On
February 8, 2023, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its Common Stock at a ratio of 1 post-split share for every 20 pre-split
shares. The Company s Common Stock begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opened on February 9, 2023 (the Reverse
Stock Split ). 

At
the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, every 20 shares of the Company s issued and outstanding Common Stock were converted
automatically into one issued and outstanding share of Common Stock without any change in the par value per share. Stockholders holding
shares through a brokerage account had their shares automatically adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock
Split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder s percentage interest in the Company s equity,
except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in a stockholder owning a fractional share. Any fractional share of a stockholder
resulting from the Reverse Stock Split was rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares. Proportional adjustments were made to the
number of shares of the Company s Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of the Company s equity awards, warrants,
and other convertible securities, as well as the applicable exercise or conversion price thereof. On February 16, 2023, the Company rounded
up fractional shares to its nearest whole number of shares. On March 31, 2024, the Company rounded up fractional shares to its
nearest whole number of shares. 

All
references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to number of shares, price per share, and weighted average number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding prior to the Reverse Stock Split have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis, unless
otherwise noted.

Financial
Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

The
fair value accounting standards define fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is determined based upon assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurements are rated on a three-tier hierarchy as follows: 

Level
 1 inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 

Level
 2 inputs: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own
 assumptions. 

There
were no transfers between Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.

On
March 15, 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award which determined that (i) the Company had the right to terminate the Exclusive Distribution
Agreement; (ii) the Company did not breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing with regard to the Exclusive Distribution Agreement;
and (iii) the Company did not breach any confidentiality obligations to Protrade. Nevertheless, the arbitrator determined that the Company
did not comply with the obligation to supply Protrade with a year s supply of patches and awarded Protrade , which consists
of for lost profits and as reimbursement of arbitration costs, on the grounds that the Company allegedly
failed to supply Protrade with certain patches utilized by users of DV0057 Painshield MD device. The arbitrator based the decision on
the testimony of Protrade s president who asserted that a user would use in excess of 33 patches per device. The Company believes
that the number of patches per device alleged by Protrade is grossly inflated and that these claims were not properly raised before the
arbitrator. Accordingly, on April 13, 2022, the Company submitted an application for correction of the award which the arbitrator denied
on June 22, 2022. 

On
April 5, 2022, Protrade filed a Petition with the Supreme Court of New York, Nassau County seeking to confirm the award. On April 13,
2022, the Company submitted an application to the ICA seeking to correct an error in the award based on the evidence that the Company
only sold 2-3 reusable patches per device contrary to the 33 reusable patches claimed by Protrade. The same arbitrator who issued the
award denied the application. 

On
July 22, 2022, the Company filed a cross-motion seeking to vacate the arbitration award on the grounds that the arbitrator exceeded her
authority, that the award was procured by fraud, and that the arbitrator failed to follow procedures established by New York law. In
particular, the Company averred in its motion that Protrade s witness made false statements in arbitration and that the arbitrator
resolved a claim that was never raised by Protrade and has no factual basis. 

On
October 3, 2022, the court issued a decision granting Protrade its petition to confirm the award and denying the cross-motion. 

On
November 9, 2022, the Company filed a motion to re-argue and renew its cross-motion to vacate the arbitration decision based on newer
information that was not available during the initial hearing. On the same day, the Company also filed a notice of appeal with the Appellate
Division, Second Department. On March 21, 2023, the court denied the motion to re-argue and renew. 

On
July 10, 2023, the Company filed an appeal with the Appellate Division, Second Department. The Company intends to continue to vigorously
pursue its opposition to the award in all appropriate fora.

Overview 

We
are a medical device company focusing on noninvasive biological response-activating devices that target wound healing and pain therapy
and can be administered at home, without the assistance of medical professionals. Our WoundShield, PainShield and UroShield products
are backed by novel technology which relates to ultrasound delivery through surface acoustic waves. 

Compliance
with Nasdaq Continued Listing Rules 

On
April 10, 2024, the Company received a letter (the Letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating
that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company s Common Stock for the 30 consecutive business days between February 27,
2024 and April 9, 2024, the Company did not meet the minimum bid price of 1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq
Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Rule ). The Letter also indicated that the Company was provided
with a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until October 7, 2024 (the Compliance Period ), in which to regain compliance
pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). 

Pursuant
to the Letter, in order to regain compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement, the Company s Common Stock was
required to maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 for at least ten consecutive business days during the Compliance Period. In
the event that the Company did not regain compliance by the end of the Compliance Period, the Company may have been eligible for additional
time to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company was required to meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of its
publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement,
and was required to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting
a reverse stock split if necessary. If the Company met these requirements, the Company may have been eligible for an additional 180 calendar
days to regain compliance. 

The
Company did not regain compliance with the Rule by October 7, 2024, and on October 8, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that the Company
was not eligible for an additional 180 day compliance period because the Company does not comply with the 5,000,000 minimum stockholders 
equity initial listing requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market, and accordingly, the Company s securities were subject to delisting
from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ). The Company subsequently
timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which has stayed any further action by Nasdaq at least pending completion of the hearing
and the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Panel. The hearing is scheduled to be held on December 5, 2024. If the
Company is delisted from Nasdaq, among other things, it will increase the difficulty in the Company s ability to raise money through
the sale of its securities. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company s cash used in operations was 1,968,000 leaving a cash balance of 1,305,000 as of September 30, 2024. Because
the Company does not have sufficient resources to fund its operations for the next twelve months from the date of this filing, management
has substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Protrade
Proceeding 

On
February 26, 2021, Protrade Systems, Inc. Protrade filed a Request for Arbitration (the Request with the
International Court of Arbitration (the ICA of the International Chamber of Commerce alleging that we were in breach of
the Exclusive Distribution Agreement. Protrade alleges, in part, that we breached the Exclusive Distribution Agreement by discontinuing
the manufacture of the DV0057 Painshield MD device in favor of an updated 10-100-001 Painshield MD device. Protrade claims damages estimated
at 3 million. 

On
March 15, 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award, which, determined that (i) we had the right to terminate the Exclusive Distribution
Agreement; (ii) we did not breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing with regard to the Exclusive Distribution Agreement; and (iii)
we did not breach any confidentiality obligations to Protrade. Nevertheless, the arbitrator determined that we did not comply with the
obligation to supply Protrade with a year s supply of patches and awarded Protrade 1,500,250, which consists of 1,432,000 for
 lost profits and 68,250 as reimbursement of arbitration costs, on the grounds that we allegedly failed to supply Protrade
with certain patches utilized by users of DV0057 Painshield MD device. The arbitrator based the decision on the testimony of Protrade s
president who asserted that a user would use in excess of 33 patches per each device. We believe that the number of patches per device
alleged by Protrade is grossly inflated and that these claims were not properly raised before the arbitrator. Accordingly, on April 13,
2022, we submitted an application for the correction of the award which the arbitrator denied on June 22, 2022. 

On
April 5, 2022, Protrade filed a Petition with the Supreme Court of New York, Nassau County seeking to confirm the award. On April 13,
2022, we submitted an application to the ICA seeking to correct an error in the award based on the evidence that we only sold 2-3 reusable
patches per device contrary to the 33 reusable patches claimed by Protrade. The same arbitrator who issued the award denied the application. 

On
July 22, 2022, we filed a cross-motion seeking to vacate arbitration award on the grounds that the arbitrator exceeded her authority,
that the award was procured by fraud, and that the arbitrator failed to follow procedures established by New York law. In particular,
we averred in our motion that Protrade s witness made false statements in arbitration and that the arbitrator resolved a claim
that was never raised by Protrade and that has no factual basis. 

14 

On
October 3, 2022, the court issued a decision granting Protrade its petition to confirm the award and denying the cross-motion. 

On
November 9, 2022, we filed a motion to re-argue and renew its cross-motion to vacate the arbitration decision based on newer information
that was not available during the initial hearing. On the same day, we also filed a notice of appeal with the Appellate Division, Second
Department. On March 21, 2023, the court denied the motion to re-argue and renew. 

On
July 10, 2023, we filed an appeal with the Appellate Division, Second Department. We intend to continue to vigorously pursue our opposition
to the award in all appropriate fora. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company accrued the amount of the arbitration award to Protrade of approximately 2.1
million for both periods including interest which is classified in Other accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires
us to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. Certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management
in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. A critical accounting policy is one that is both important
to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult, subjective, or complex
judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting
policies are more fully described in both (i) Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations and (ii) Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K,
as amended, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have not been any material changes to such critical accounting policies
since December 31, 2023.

of Operations 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues .
For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenues were approximately 376,000 and 458,000, respectively, a decrease
of approximately 18 , or 82,000, between the periods. The decrease was mainly attributable to decrease of revenues received from customers
from Veteran Administration facilities or through workman s compensation programs, referred to us from three sales representatives
to whom we sold our products directly due to our lowering of certain wholesale prices to these representatives during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our revenues may fluctuate as we add new customers
or when existing distributors make large purchases of our products during one period and no purchases during another period. Our revenues
by quarter may not be linear or consistent. We do not anticipate that our revenues will be impacted by inflation or changing prices in
the foreseeable future.

of devices which have higher gross margins, and to a lesser extent the write-off of obsolete inventory. 

Gross
profit as a percentage of revenues was approximately 35 and 76 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is mainly due to the reasons described above.

Research
and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were approximately 66 and 7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024

compensation expenses, expenses related to subcontracting, patents application and registration, and clinical trial and facilities expenses
associated with and allocated to research and development activities.

 673,000 and 796,000, respectively, a decrease of approximately 15 , or 123,000, between the periods. The decrease was primarily due
to a decrease in legal fees related to securities and litigation matters, as well as accounting fees incurred in 2024, as compared to
2023.

respectively, an increase of approximately 28,000 between the periods mainly due to the gain/loss related to the termination of the investment
in Sanuwave and interest payments received. 

Net
loss. Our net loss increased by approximately 37 , or 270,000, to approximately 997,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2024 from approximately 724,000 in the same period of 2023. The decrease in net loss resulted primarily from the factors described above. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues .
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenues were approximately 2,114,000 and 1,106,000 respectively, an increase
of approximately 91 , or 1,008,000 between the periods. The increase was due to increased revenues from customers from Veteran Administration
facilities and through workman s compensation programs who are referred to us from certain sales representatives, and UPPI in 2024.

an increase of approximately 53 or 425,000. The increase was mainly due to the increase in revenues in 2024. The decrease in the gross
margin percentage for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to lowering our wholesale sales price awarded to customers from
Veteran Administration facilities or through workman s compensation programs who are referred to us from certain sales representatives,
which took place in the second quarter of 2024. 

Gross
profit as a percentage of revenues was approximately 58 and 72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 557,000 and 123,000, respectively, an increase of approximately 353 , or 434,000, between the periods. The increase was due to the
costs of our product development project which we started in 2024 as well as the cost of our clinical trial test program with the University

Our
research and development expenses consist mainly of payroll expenses to employees involved in research and development activities, stock-based

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

General 

We
have incurred losses in the amount of approximately 2,274,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as we continue to maintain
significant net operating losses from operations. We also had negative cash flow from operating activities of 1,968,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. We had a cash balance of just over 1,305,000 as of September 30, 2024, and we expect to continue to
incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. Due to the continued expected negative cash flow from operations and
the potential arbitration payment, if we are unsuccessful in our appeals, the Company does not have sufficient resources to fund operations
for at least the next twelve months from the date of this filing. As such, there is substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a
going concern. 

We
will need to continue to raise additional capital to finance our losses and negative cash flows from operations and may continue to be
dependent on additional capital raising as long as our products do not reach commercial profitability. If we are unable to raise additional
capital, we will need to adjust our business plan and reduce workforce, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and
its financial position. 

During
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we met our short-term liquidity requirements from our existing cash reserves and from
the sale of our securities. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including
our ability to successfully commercialize our products, our development of future products, competing technological, and market developments.
We expect to continue to incur losses and negative flows from operations. We intend to use the proceeds generated from equity financings,
or strategic alliances with third parties, either alone or in combination with equity financing to meet our short-term liquidity requirements
as well as to advance our long-term plans. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital, as required, on
terms favorable to us. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we do not have a commitment to fund our product redevelopment project for approximately another 1.2 million over
the next four quarters as well as the 2 million owed to Protrade as of September 30, 2024, under the court decision, which we continue
to appeal. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other
relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have, or may have, a material effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

of September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately 1,305,000, compared to approximately 3,283,000 as of December 31, 2023. The decrease
in cash was primarily due to our net loss of 2,274,000 which primarily consisted of increased revenues and increased gross margins offset
by our operating expenses. We have historically met our cash needs through a combination of issuance of equity, borrowing activities
and sales. Our cash requirements are generally for product development, research, and development cost, marketing and sales activities,
finance and administrative cost, capital expenditures, and general working capital. 

Cash
used in our operating activities was approximately 1,968,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,111,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash
used in our investing activities was approximately 3,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash
provided by financing activities was approximately 1,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4,222,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this Item 3. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term
 disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls
and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form
10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting as described in Item 9A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal ended December 31, 2023,
initially filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024. 

Remediation
Efforts to Address Material Weakness 

With
the oversight of senior management and audit committee of the Board of Directors, we have taken the steps below and we plan to take additional
measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described in
Item 9A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal ended December 31, 2023, initially filed with the SEC on April
8, 2024: 

We
 have been able to remediate the material weakness identified above with respect to the issuance of shares in excess of the number
 of authorized shares in 2021 issued in connection with the conversion of shares of our preferred stock and the exercise of certain
 warrants and implemented a plan to have adequate controls in place to avoid future issuances in excess of authorized shares. The
 Company took steps to remediate the stock issuance material weakness through creating procedures over the approval of any new equity
 issuances to ensure that there are no further over-issuances which includes the creation of an equity roll forward master sheet that
 must be approved and signed off by senior management before any new equity issuances, including warrants, stock options, and issuances
 of any shares of stock. 

With
 assistance from a finance and accounting third-party service provider, the Company was able to formalize our risk assessment process,
 policies, and procedures, implementing revised control activities, controls documentation, and ongoing monitoring activities related
 to the internal controls over financial reporting, including testing documentation to provide evidence that our system of internal
 controls over financial reporting meets the requirements of the COSO 2013 framework and provide a foundation for the Company to communicate
 internal control deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible for taking corrective action. 

We
 expanded consultations with third-party specialists on complex accounting matters, financial reporting and regulatory filings, and
 to create enhanced documentation to support a more precise review process, as well as enhanced monitoring of the review process,
 effective enhanced monitoring of the review process, and an effective system of training of use and review of our inventory recording
 systems. 

In
addition, under the direction of the audit committee of the Board of Directors, management will continue to review and make necessary
changes to the overall design of the Company s internal control environment, as well as to refine policies and procedures to improve
the overall effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of the Company. After all the remediation efforts, not all material
weaknesses may be remediated and others may arise in future periods. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than described above in Item 4, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last
fiscal quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Part
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may be involved in certain claims and litigation arising out of the ordinary course and conduct of business. Management
assesses such claims and, if it considers that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred and the
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, provisions for loss are made based on management s assessment of the most likely outcome. 

The
information set forth in Note 10 Commitment and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q is incorporated by reference herein. 

There
are no other material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers, affiliates, any registered or beneficial stockholder of more
than 5 of our Common Stock, or any associate of any of the foregoing is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

The
following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, the risk factors addressed
below associated with our business, financial condition and results of operations previously disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors 
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as initially filed with the SEC on April
8, 2024. Our business, financial condition, and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or
unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual
financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating
results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating
results, and stock price. 

The
following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other
statements in this Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements
and related notes in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements and Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-Q. 

We
conduct our operations in Israel Conditions in Israel, and, therefore, our business, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely
affected by political, economic and military instability in Israel, including the ongoing multi-front war between Israel and terrorist
groups and hostile state actors in the Middle East. 

Because
we are incorporated under the laws of the state of Israel and our operations are conducted in Israel, our business and operations are
directly affected by economic, political, geopolitical, and military conditions in Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel
in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its neighboring countries and terrorist organizations active in
the region. These conflicts have involved missile strikes, hostile infiltrations, and terrorism against civilian targets in various parts
of Israel, which have negatively affected business conditions in Israel. 

Most
recently, in October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of
attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population and industrial centers
located along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. Following the attack, Israel s
security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against the terrorist organization commenced in parallel to their
continued rocket and terror attacks. 

Following
the attack by Hamas on Israel s southern border, Hezbollah in Lebanon has also launched missiles, rockets, and shooting attacks
against Israeli military sites, troops, and Israeli towns in northern Israel. In response to these attacks, the Israeli army has carried
out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and begun conducting a limited ground operation
in southern Lebanon, which has the potential to escalate into a wider regional conflict. 

In
addition, Iran recently launched direct attacks on Israel. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in
the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and Iraq.
The Houthis, a military organization based in Yemen, have launched a series of attacks on global shipping routes in the Red Sea, as well
as direct attacks on various parts of Israel. 

Such
incidents contribute to regional instability and could potentially escalate into broader conflicts with Iran and its proxies in the middle
east, affecting Israel s political and trade relations, especially with neighboring countries and global allies. The situation remains
fluid, and the potential for further escalation exists. 

Any
hostilities involving Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade within Israel or between Israel and its trading partners, or
the ability to ship our products overseas, could adversely affect our operations and results of operations and could make it more difficult
for us to raise capital. Parties with whom we may do business have sometimes declined to travel to Israel during periods of heightened
unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary. The conflict situation in Israel could cause situations
where medical product certifying or auditing bodies could not be able to visit manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors in Israel
in order to review our certifications or clearances, thus possibly leading to temporary suspensions or even cancellations of our product
clearances or certifications. The conflict situation in Israel could also result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance
in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions
in such agreements. 

There
have been travel advisories issued related to travel to Israel, restriction on travel, and delays and disruptions as related to imports
and exports may be imposed in the future. An inability to receive supplies and materials, shortages of materials or difficulties in procuring
our materials, among others, or conversely, our ability to ship products to our US facilities or overseas customers, may adversely impact
our ability to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates and products in a timely manner. This could cause a number of delays
and/or issues for our operations, including delay of the review of our product candidates by regulatory agencies, which in turn would
have a material adverse impact on our ability to commercialize our product candidates. 

Additionally,
members of our management and employees are located and reside in Israel. Shelter-in-place and work-from-home measures, government-imposed
restrictions on movement and travel, and other precautions taken to address the ongoing conflict may temporarily disrupt our management
and employees ability to effectively perform their daily tasks. 

20 

The
IDF, the national military of Israel, is a conscripted military service, subject to certain exceptions. None of our employees are subject
to military service in the IDF and have been called to serve, but many do serve on guard duty in their local communities from time to
time. It is possible that there will be further military reserve duty call-ups in the future, which may affect our business due to a
shortage of skilled labor and loss of institutional knowledge, and necessary mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease
in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, for example, which may have unintended negative effects and adversely
impact our results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows. 

It
is currently not possible to predict the duration or severity of the ongoing conflict or its effects on our business, operations, and
financial conditions. The ongoing conflict is rapidly evolving and developing, and could disrupt our business and operations, interrupt
our sources and availability of supply, and hamper our ability to raise additional funds or sell our securities, among others. 

The
Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include adjustments that might be necessary
if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Management has substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

The
Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the three months ended September
30, 2024, the Company s cash used in operations was 1,978,000 leaving a cash balance of 1,305,000 as of September 30, 2024. Because
the Company does not have sufficient resources to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the date of this filing, management
has substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company will need to raise additional capital to finance its losses and negative cash flows from operations and may continue to be dependent
on additional capital raising as long as our products do not reach commercial profitability. There are no assurances that the Company
would be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to it. If the Company is unsuccessful in commercializing its products and
raising capital, it will need to reduce activities, curtail, or cease operations. 

If
we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our Common Stock may be delisted and the price of our Common Stock
and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. 

Our
Common Stock is currently listed for trading on Nasdaq. We must satisfy Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, including, among
other things, a minimum stockholders equity of 2.5 million and a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share or risk
delisting, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. A delisting of our Common Stock from Nasdaq could materially reduce
the liquidity of our Common Stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our Common Stock. In addition, delisting
could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in
the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities. 

On
April 10, 2024, the Company received a letter (the Letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating
that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company s Common Stock for the 30 consecutive business days between February 27,
2024 and April 9, 2024, the Company did not meet the minimum bid price of 1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq
Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Rule ). The Letter also indicated that the Company was provided
with a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until October 7, 2024 (the Compliance Period ), in which to regain compliance
pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). 

21 

Pursuant
to the Letter in order to regain compliance with Nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement, the Company s Common Stock was required
to maintain a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 for at least ten consecutive business days during the Compliance Period. In the event
the Company does not regain compliance by the end of the Compliance Period, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain
compliance. To qualify, the Company was required to meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of its publicly held
shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and was
required to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse
stock split if necessary. If the Company met these requirements, the Company may have been eligible for an additional 180 calendar days
to regain compliance. 

The
Company did not regain compliance with the Rule by October 7, 2024, and on October 8, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that the Company
was not eligible for an additional 180 day compliance period because the Company does not comply with the 5,000,000 minimum stockholders 
equity initial listing requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market, and accordingly, the Company s securities were subject to delisting
from Nasdaq unless the Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ). The Company subsequently
timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which has stayed any further action by Nasdaq at least pending completion of the hearing
and the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Panel. The hearing is scheduled to be held on December 5, 2024. 

There
can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company an additional extension period or that the Company will ultimately regain compliance
with all applicable requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.
