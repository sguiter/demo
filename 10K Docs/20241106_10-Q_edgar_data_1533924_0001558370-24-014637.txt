Table of Contents 
 GLOSSARY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS TERMS Analogous Reservoir: Analogous reservoirs, as used in resource assessments, have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth, temperature, and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery. When used to support proved reserves, analogous reservoir refers to a reservoir that shares all of the following characteristics with the reservoir of interest: (i) the same geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest); (ii) the same environment of deposition; (iii) similar geologic structure; and (iv) the same drive mechanism. Bbl: One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in reference to oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. Bbl/d: One Bbl per day. Bcfe: One billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent. Boe: One barrel of oil equivalent, calculated by converting natural gas to oil equivalent barrels at a ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil. BOEM: U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. BSEE: Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Btu: One British thermal unit, the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of a one-pound mass of water by one degree Fahrenheit. CO 2 : Carbon dioxide. Development Project: A development project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible. As examples, the development of a single reservoir or field, an incremental development in a producing field or the integrated development of a group of several fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a development project. Dry Hole or Dry Well: A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production would exceed production expenses and taxes. Economically Producible: The term economically producible, as it relates to a resource, means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. For this determination, the value of the products that generate revenue are determined at the terminal point of oil and natural gas producing activities. Exploitation: A development or other project which may target proven or unproven reserves (such as probable or possible reserves), but which generally has a lower risk than that associated with exploration projects. Field: An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs, all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. The field name refers to the surface area, although it may refer to both the surface and the underground productive formations. Gross Acres or Gross Wells: The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which we have a working interest. Henry Hub: A distribution hub in Louisiana that serves as the delivery location for natural gas futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. ICE: Inter-Continental Exchange. MBbl: One thousand Bbls.

Table of Contents 
 MBbls/d: One thousand Bbls per day. MBoe: One thousand barrels of oil equivalent. MBoe/d: One thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. MMBoe: One million barrels of oil equivalent. Mcf: One thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Mcf/d: One Mcf per day. MMBtu: One million Btu. MMcf: One million cubic feet of natural gas. MMcfe: One million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent. MMcfe/d: One MMcfe per day. Net Production: Production that is owned by us less royalties and production due to others. NGLs: The combination of ethane, propane, butane and natural gasolines that, when removed from natural gas, become liquid under various levels of higher pressure and lower temperature. NYMEX: New York Mercantile Exchange. NYSE: New York Stock Exchange. Oil: Oil and condensate. Operator: The individual or company responsible for the exploration and/or production of an oil or natural gas well or lease. OPIS: Oil Price Information Service. Plugging and Abandonment: Refers to the sealing off of fluids in the strata penetrated by a well so that the fluids from one stratum will not escape into another stratum or to the surface. Regulations of all states require plugging of abandoned wells. Probabilistic Estimate: The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence. Proved Developed Reserves: Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.

Table of Contents 
 Proved Reserves: Those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced, or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project, within a reasonable time. The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or natural gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons, as seen in a well penetration, unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated natural gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, or an Analogous Reservoir or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based, and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price used is the average price during the twelve-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. Realized Price: The cash market price less all expected quality, transportation and demand adjustments. Reliable Technology: Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. Reserves: Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and natural gas or related substances to market and all permits and financing required to implement the project. Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). Reservoir: A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reserves. Resources: Resources are quantities of oil and natural gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable and another portion may be considered unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations. SEC: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Working Interest: An interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and natural gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations. Workover: Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. WTI: West Texas Intermediate.

As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing base under the facility was million with elected commitments of million, and, consistent with the Prior Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility borrowing base is subject to redetermination on at least a semi-annual basis, primarily based on a reserve engineering report. Certain key terms and conditions under the Revolving Credit Facility include (but are not limited to): A maturity date of July 31, 2027; The loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) adjusted SOFR or (ii) an adjusted base rate, plus an applicable margin based on a utilization ratio of the lesser of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments. The applicable margin ranges from to for adjusted base rate borrowings, and to for adjusted SOFR borrowings; The unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility will accrue a commitment fee of , payable quarterly in arrears; Certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of (i) a net debt leverage ratio not to exceed to 1.00, determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal-quarter period then ending and (ii) a current ratio of not less than to , determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, in each case commencing with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023; Certain events of default, including, without limitation: non-payment breaches of representations and warranties non-compliance with covenants or other agreements cross-default to material indebtedness judgments change of control and voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy; and Initial minimum hedging requirements covering of the reasonably projected monthly production of hydrocarbons from proved developed producing reserves for the 24-month period following the effective date of the Revolving Credit Facility (the First Period and (ii) for the 12-month period immediately following the First Period.

The 2022 and 2023 PSU awards are accounted for as equity-classified awards and were issued with a vesting period beginning on the grant date and ending on the third anniversary of the grant date. The performance period for the 2022 awards is January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. The performance period for the 2023 awards is January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025. In February 2024, the Company granted contingent cash-settlement awards in the form of PSUs (the 2024 PSUs ). In May 2024, the Company received shareholder approval of the 2024 EIP, which removed the contingent consideration around the 2024 PSUs. As of June 30, 2024, the 2024 PSUs were reclassified as equity awards with a vesting period. The compensation cost related to these awards is determined by the fair value of the award on the modification date. The performance period for the 2024 PSUs is January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026. Compensation costs related to PSU awards are recorded as general and administrative expense.

 Compensation Expense PSUs prior written notice. The majority of its month-to-month leases are not included as a lease liability in its balance sheet because continuation of the lease is not reasonably certain. Additionally, the Company elected the short-term practical expedient to exclude leases with a term of twelve months or less. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, all of the Company s leases qualified as operating leases, and it did not have any existing or new leases qualifying as financing leases or variable leases. The Company s corporate office lease does not provide an implicit rate. To determine the present value of the lease payments, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the inception date. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Company applies a portfolio approach based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment. The Company uses a reasonable market interest rate for its office equipment and vehicle leases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized approximately million and million, respectively, of costs relating to the operating leases in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Revenue Payables in Suspense During 2024, the Company determined that it had improperly classified certain non-operated revenue within revenues payable in suspense from 2015 through 2024 and had also retained revenue suspense on assets previously sold in 2018 for which no obligation existed subsequent to the date of close. As a result, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment of million in 2024 to release such amounts as previously accrued within revenue payables in suspense, of which million and million included in oil and natural gas revenue and other income, respectively, in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management considered qualitative and quantitative factors and concluded the out-of-period adjustment is immaterial to 2024 and each of the applicable periods. Beta Pipeline Incident Please refer to Note 16. Beta Pipeline Incident for details. Sinking Fund Trust Agreement Beta Operating Company, LLC Beta LLC ), a wholly owned subsidiary, assumed an obligation with a third party to make payments into a sinking fund in connection with the Company s properties in federal waters offshore Southern California, the purpose of which is to provide funds adequate to decommission the portion of the San Pedro Bay Pipeline that lies within state waters and the surface facilities. Interest earned in the account stays in the account. The obligation to fund ceases when the aggregate value of the account reaches million. As of September 30, 2024, the account balance included in restricted investments was approximately million.

 million of A-rated surety bonds. In December 2021, the Company entered into escrow funding agreements with its surety providers to fund interest-bearing escrow accounts on a quarterly basis to reimburse and indemnify the surety providers for any claims arising under the surety bonds related to the decommissioning of our Beta LLC properties. In March 2024, the Company amended of the escrow funding agreements to decrease the amount funded from million per year to million per year. There were no changes made to the second escrow agreement. The obligation for these agreements ceases when the total aggregate value of the escrow accounts reaches million.

The difference between the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of and the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was caused by higher state taxes, partially offset by marginal well tax credits pursuant to Section 45I of the Internal Revenue Code and a windfall tax benefit from stock compensation.

The item that had the most significant impact on the difference between the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of and the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was the release of the valuation allowance. miles off the coast of Newport Beach, California. Beta LLC platform personnel were notified and promptly initiated the Company s Oil Spill Response Plan. On October 3, 2021, a Unified Command, consisting of the Company, the U.S. Coast Guard and California Department of Fish and Wildlife s Office of Spill Prevention and Response, was established to respond to the Incident. Reports from the Unified Command s contracted commercial divers and Remotely Operated Vehicle footage indicated that a -foot section of the Company s pipeline had been displaced and that the pipeline had a -inch split, running parallel to the pipe, releasing approximately barrels of oil.

 million in installments over a period of , serve a term of probation and reimburse governmental agencies approximately million for their response to this event. Additionally, as part of the resolution with the state of California, the Company agreed to enter a plea of No Contest to misdemeanor charges, and, as a result, paid a fine in the amount of million to be distributed among the state of California, including the State s Fish and Game Preservation Fund, and Orange County, agreed to serve a term of probation and agreed to certain compliance enhancements to its operations. The Company is currently subject to a number of ongoing investigations related to the Incident by certain federal and state agencies and may be subject to new investigations and proceedings in the future, the results of which may have a material impact on the Company s business and results of operations and could put pressure on its liquidity position going forward. With respect to PHMSA s investigation, on April 6, 2023, PHMSA provided the Company notice of PHMSA s positions regarding probable violations of the Pipeline Safety Regulations in connection with the Incident. The Company has responded to the notice and is conferring with PHMSA regarding a resolution. Amplify continues to comply with all regulatory requirements and investigations. The outcomes of these investigations and the nature of any remedies pursued will depend on the discretion of the relevant authorities and may result in regulatory or other enforcement actions, as well as civil liability. The Company, Beta LLC, and San Pedro Bay Pipeline Company were named as defendants in a consolidated putative class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserting claims against the Company, Beta LLC, San Pedro Bay Pipeline Company, among others. On August 25, 2022, the Company reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs in the class action to resolve all civil claims against it and its subsidiaries. The settlement of million, which also includes certain injunctive relief, has been and will continue to be funded under the Company s insurance policies. The Court granted final approval of the settlement on April 24, 2023. Separately, on March 1, 2023, the Company announced that the vessels that struck and damaged the pipeline and their respective owners and operators agreed to pay the Company million in a settlement. This settlement resolved Amplify s affirmative claims related to the Incident, and as such, Amplify dismissed its legal claims against those parties. Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq. OPA 90 ), the Company s pipeline was designated by the U.S. Coast Guard as the source of the oil discharge and therefore the Company is financially responsible for remediation and for certain costs and economic damages as provided for in OPA 90, as well as certain natural resource damages associated with the spill and certain costs determined by federal and state trustees engaged in a joint assessment of such natural resource damages. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has completed processing all outstanding covered claims under OPA 90. In addition, the Natural Resource Damage Assessment remains ongoing and therefore the extent, timing and cost related to such assessment are difficult to project. While the Company anticipates insurance will reimburse it for expenses related to the Natural Resource Damage Assessment, any potentially uncovered expenses may be material and could impact the Company s business and results of operations and could put pressure on its liquidity position going forward. On or about October 10, 2024, the Company reached settlements with the City of Huntington Beach and Pacific Airshow LLC. The Company has resolved all known claims arising from the Incident and believes there are no more claims outstanding, except through the ongoing Natural Resource Damage Assessment process.

 million to million. The range of total costs is based on the Company s assumptions regarding (i) settlement of costs associated with certain vendors for response and remediation expenses, (ii) resolution of certain third-party claims, excluding claims with respect to losses, which are not probable or reasonably estimable, and (iii) future claims and lawsuits. While the Company believes it has accurately reflected all probable and reasonably estimable costs incurred in the Company s Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations, these estimates are subject to uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions. Accordingly, as the Company s assumptions and estimates may change in future periods based on future events, the Company can provide no assurance that total costs will not materially change in future periods. The Company s estimates do not include (i) the nature, extent and cost of future legal services that will be required in connection with all lawsuits, claims and other matters requiring legal or expert advice associated with the Incident, (ii) any lost revenue associated with the suspension of operations at Beta, (iii) any liabilities or costs, including regulatory costs, that are not reasonably estimable at this time or that relate to contingencies where the Company currently regards the likelihood of loss as being only reasonably possible or remote and (iv) the costs associated with the permanent repair of the pipeline and the restart of operations at Beta. In accordance with customary insurance practice, the Company maintains insurance policies, including loss of production insurance, against many potential losses or liabilities arising from its operations, which, in addition to the settlement amount disclosed, have covered a material portion of aggregate costs associated with the Incident. However, the Company can provide no assurance that its coverage will continue to adequately protect it against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses related to the Incident and such view and understanding is preliminary and subject to change. On September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company s insurance receivables were million and million, respectively. Excluding the costs associated with the resolution of the federal and state matters discussed above, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred response and remediation expenses and legal fees of million, which primarily relates to certain legal costs that are not expected to be recovered under an insurance policy and are classified as Pipeline Incident Loss on the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in Item 1. Financial Statements contained herein and in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in the front of this report. Overview We operate in one reportable segment engaged in the acquisition, development, exploitation and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our management evaluates performance based on the reportable business segment as the economic environments are not different within the operation of our oil and natural gas properties. Our business activities are conducted through OLLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Our assets consist primarily of producing oil and natural gas properties located in Oklahoma, the Rockies Bairoil ), federal waters offshore Southern California Beta ), East Texas/North Louisiana and the Eagle Ford (non-op). Most of our oil and natural gas properties are located in large, mature oil and natural gas reservoirs. Industry Trends We continue to monitor the impact of the actions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large producing nations; the Russia-Ukraine conflict; conflicts in the Middle East; global inventories of oil and natural gas and the uncertainty associated with recovering oil demand; inflation and future monetary policy; and governmental policies aimed at transitioning towards lower carbon energy. Due to these factors, among others, we expect prices for some or all commodities to remain volatile. Thus, we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the extent to which these factors may impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Recent Developments Credit Agreement Amendment On October 25, 2024, OLLC entered into the Credit Agreement Amendment, which among other things, (i) reduced the borrowing base under the Revolving Credit Facility from 150.0 million to 145.0 million, (ii) increased the aggregate elected commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from 135.0 million to 145.0 million and (iii) amended certain interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Credit Facility. The next redetermination is expected in the spring of 2025. Business Environment and Operational Focus We use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our oil and natural gas operations, including: (i) production volumes; (ii) realized prices on the sale of our production; (iii) cash settlements on our commodity derivatives; (iv) lease operating expense; (v) gathering, processing and transportation; (vi) general and administrative expense; and (vii) Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below). Sources of Revenues Our revenues are derived from the sale of natural gas and oil production, as well as the sale of NGLs that are extracted from natural gas during processing. Production revenues are derived entirely from the continental United States. Natural gas, NGL and oil prices are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside our control. In order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices on revenues, we intend to periodically enter into derivative contracts that fix the future prices received. At the end of each period, the fair value of these commodity derivative instruments is estimated and because hedge accounting is not elected, the changes in the fair value of unsettled commodity derivative instruments are recognized in earnings at the end of each accounting period.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our critical accounting policies and estimates, including a discussion regarding the estimation uncertainty and the impact that our critical accounting estimates have had, or are reasonably likely to have, on our financial condition or results of operations, are described in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, oil and natural gas reserves; fair value estimates; revenue recognition; and contingencies and insurance accounting. These estimates, in our opinion, are subjective in nature, require the use of professional judgment and involve complex analysis. When used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, such estimates are based on our current knowledge and understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may be revised as a result of actions we take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Revenue Payables in Suspense In the normal course of business, we undertake efforts to research and resolve the disputes, legal reasons or uncertainties causing revenues of owners of mineral interests in our leases to go into suspense. As resolutions occur, obligations related to revenue payables in suspense are released. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we released 8.4 million, respectively, of net revenues in suspense as a result of these efforts. The following table presents the impact of releases of revenue payables in suspense to our statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 We reported net income of 22.7 million compared to a net loss of 13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Oil, natural gas and NGL revenues were 68.1 million and 76.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average net production volumes were approximately 19.0 MBoe/d and 20.6 MBoe/d for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in production volumes was driven by several days shut-in for the electrification and emissions reduction project at Beta and natural decline in well productivity over time. The average realized sales prices were 38.88 per Boe and 40.28 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in average realized sales prices was primarily due to lower commodity prices. Other revenues were 1.7 million and 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other revenues consisted of iodine sales, rental income with respect to our wholly owned subsidiary, Magnify Energy Services Magnify ), and interest income earned on our sinking fund escrow accounts. Lease operating expenses were 33.3 million and 36.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On a per Boe basis, lease operating expenses were 18.98 and 19.23 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in lease operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease of 1.5 million in lease operating cost and a decrease of 1.7 million in workover expense. Gathering, processing and transportation expenses were 4.3 million and 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On a per Boe basis, gathering, processing and transportation expenses were 2.45 and 2.63 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in gathering, processing and transportation expense was primarily due to lower gas volumes and natural gas prices. Taxes other than income were 6.0 million and 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On a per Boe basis, taxes other than income were 3.42 and 2.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily related to waste emissions charges and air quality management district fees in California. DD A expenses were 8.1 million and 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in DD A expense was primarily driven by increased production at Beta. General and administrative expenses were 8.3 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. General and administrative expenses were previously forecasted to remain flat compared to the prior year. Net gain on commodity derivative instruments of 25.0 million were recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of 18.7 million increase in the fair value of open positions, 5.6 million of cash settlements received on expired positions and 0.8 million of cash settlements received on terminated derivative instruments. Net loss on commodity derivative instruments of 23.3 million was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of 3.9 million of cash settlements paid on expired positions and an increase of 20.1 million in the fair value of open position, partially offset by 0.7 million of cash settlements received on terminated derivative instruments. Pipeline incident loss was 0.2 million and 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These costs reflect certain expenses not expected to be recovered under an insurance policy. See Note 16 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 1. Financial Statements of this quarterly report for additional information. Interest expense, net was 3.8 million and 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in interest expense was primarily attributable to the write-off of deferred financing costs in connection with the refinancing of the Revolving Credit Facility in July 2023. Average outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility were 122.5 million and 121.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Litigation settlement was not recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Current income tax benefit (expense) was 0.4) million and 1.4) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See additional information discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 1. Financial Statements of this quarterly report. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) was 5.7) million and 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Starting in the first quarter of 2023, we achieved three years of cumulative book income which resulted in the release of the valuation allowance. See additional information discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 1. Financial Statements of this quarterly report. For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 We reported net income of 20.4 million compared to net income of 349.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Oil, natural gas and NGL revenues were 215.8 million and 210.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average net production volumes were approximately 19.8 MBoe/d and 20.4 MBoe/d for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average realized sales prices were 39.69 per Boe and 37.72 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in realized sales prices was primarily due to higher commodity prices, Beta returning to production after being offline for the first quarter of 2023 and the release of revenue suspense of 4.0 million. Other revenues were 9.9 million and 18.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other revenues consisted of iodine sales, Magnify rental income, and interest income earned on our sinking fund escrow accounts. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a revenue suspense release of 4.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other revenues were primarily related to our receipt of LOPI insurance proceeds of 17.9 million. We have not received LOPI insurance proceeds since payments under the LOPI policy terminated on March 31, 2023. Lease operating expenses were 107.9 million and 104.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On a per Boe basis, lease operating expenses were 19.83 and 18.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in lease operating expense was primarily related to operating costs associated with Beta returning to production after being offline for the first quarter of 2023. Gathering, processing and transportation expenses were 14.0 million and 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On a per Boe basis, gathering, processing and transportation expenses were 2.57 and 2.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in gathering, processing and transportation expense was primarily due to lower gas volumes, lower natural gas prices and the expiration of minimum volume commitments for our Oklahoma properties. Taxes other than income were 15.5 million and 16.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On a per Boe basis, taxes other than income were 2.86 and 2.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily related to a reduction in production taxes and ad valorem taxes for 2024 due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by an increase in emissions charges. DD A expenses were 24.2 million and 20.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in DD A expense was primarily driven by operations restarting at Beta. General and administrative expenses were 26.4 million and 24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to an increase of 1.5 million in stock compensation expense, an increase of 0.5 million in legal expense, and an increase of 0.5 million in office lease expense related to the early termination of our Oklahoma office lease, partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in professional services.

Net loss on commodity derivative instruments of 4.4 million was recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of 5.1 million of cash settlements paid on expired positions, partially offset by 0.7 million of cash settlement received on terminated derivative instruments and a less than 0.1 million increase in the fair value of open positions. Pipeline incident loss was 1.5 million and 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Financial Statements of this quarterly report for additional information. Interest expense, net was 10.9 million and 13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in interest expense was primarily driven by lower outstanding borrowings and amortization and write-off of deferred issuance costs. Average outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility were 119.8 million and 145.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

See additional information discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 1. Financial Statements of this quarterly report. Current income tax benefit (expense) was 2.4) million and 7.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See additional information discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 1. Financial Statements of this quarterly report. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) was 3.1) million and 264.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Starting in the first quarter of 2023, we achieved three years of cumulative book income which resulted in the release of the valuation allowance. See additional information discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 1. Financial Statements of this quarterly report. Adjusted EBITDA We include in this report the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA and provide our reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities, our most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss): Plus: Interest expense; Income tax expense; DD Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets (including oil and natural gas properties); Accretion of AROs; Loss on commodity derivative instruments;

 Cash settlements received on expired commodity derivative instruments; Amortization of gain associated with terminated commodity derivatives; Losses on sale of assets; Share-based compensation expenses; Exploration costs; Acquisition and divestiture related expenses; Reorganization items, net; Severance payments; and Other non-routine items that we deem appropriate. 
 Less: Interest income; Income tax benefit; Gain on commodity derivative instruments; Cash settlements paid on expired commodity derivative instruments; Gains on sale of assets and other, net; and Other non-routine items that we deem appropriate. 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance, such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt service requirements. In addition, we use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate actual cash flow available to develop existing reserves or acquire additional oil and natural gas properties. The following tables present our reconciliation of the Company s net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities to Adjusted EBITDA, our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview. Our ability to finance our operations, including funding capital expenditures and acquisitions, to meet our indebtedness obligations, to refinance our indebtedness or to meet our collateral requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have historically been cash flows generated by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. As we pursue reserve and production growth, we plan to monitor which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to us to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. Based on our current oil and natural gas price expectations, we believe our cash flows provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will provide us with the financial flexibility necessary to meet our cash requirements, including normal operating needs, and to pursue our currently planned 2024 development activities. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of our oil and natural gas production and the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. We cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. For the remainder of 2024, we expect our primary funding sources to be from internally generated cash flow but retain the flexibility to utilize borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and/or to access the debt and equity capital markets. Impact of the Beta Pipeline Incident. There are remaining uncertainties surrounding the full impact that the Incident will have on our financial condition and cash flow generation going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur certain costs as a result of the Incident. However, in addition to the settlement amount disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that we received from the vessels that struck and damaged the Pipeline and their respective owners and operators, we carry customary insurance policies, which have covered a material portion of aggregate costs, including loss of production income insurance to offset loss of revenue resulting from suspended operations. The loss of production income insurance related to the Incident expired on March 31, 2023. We restarted operations at Beta in April 2023. We can provide no assurance that our coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses related to the Incident. Capital Markets. We do not currently anticipate any near-term capital markets activity, but we will continue to evaluate the availability of public debt and equity for funding potential future growth projects and acquisition activity. Hedging. Commodity hedging has been and remains an important part of our strategy to reduce cash flow volatility. Our hedging activities are intended to support oil, NGL and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We intend to enter into commodity derivative contracts at times and on terms desired to maintain a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts covering at least 50 - 75 of our estimated production from total proved developed producing reserves over a one-to-three-year period at any given point of time. We may, however, from time to time, hedge more or less than this approximate amount. Additionally, we may take advantage of opportunities to modify our commodity derivative portfolio to change the percentage of our hedged production volumes when circumstances suggest that it is prudent to do so. The current market conditions may also impact our ability to enter into future commodity derivative contracts. We evaluate counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative contracts and trade credit. Should any of these financial counterparties not perform, we may not realize the benefit of some of our hedges under lower commodity prices. Capital Expenditures. Total capital expenditures were approximately 55.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were primarily related to the development program at Beta, capital workovers and facilities upgrade projects at Beta and in Oklahoma and non-operated drilling and completion activities in East Texas and the Eagle Ford. Working Capital. Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. Our working capital requirements are primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as the classification of our debt outstanding. These changes are impacted by changes in the prices of commodities that we buy and sell. In general, our working capital requirements increase in periods of rising commodity prices and decrease in periods of declining commodity prices. However, our working capital needs do not necessarily change at the same rate as commodity prices because both accounts receivable and accounts payable are impacted by the same commodity prices. In addition, the timing of payments received by our customers or paid to our suppliers can also cause fluctuations in working capital because we settle with most of our larger customers on a monthly basis and often near the end of the month. We expect that our future working capital requirements will be impacted by these same factors.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit (excluding commodity derivatives) of 11.6 million primarily due to accrued liabilities of 36.7 million, revenues payable of 11.4 million, and accounts payable of 18.1 million partially offset by accounts receivable of 32.3 million and prepaid expenses of 22.3 million. Debt Agreement Revolving Credit Facility. On July 31, 2023, OLLC and Acquisitionco entered into the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is a replacement in full of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility. The aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024, was 120.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 15.0 million of available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all the financial (current ratio and total leverage ratio) and non-financial covenants associated with the Revolving Credit Facility. On October 25, 2024, we entered into the Credit Agreement Amendment, which among other things, (i) reduced the borrowing base under the Revolving Credit Facility from 150.0 million to 145.0 million, (ii) increased the aggregate elected commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from 135.0 million to 145.0 million and (iii) amended certain interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Credit Facility.

 Operating Activities. Key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs. Net cash provided by operating activities was 38.8 million and 113.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 84.9 million in connection with the settlement between the Company and the vessels that struck and damaged the pipeline and their respective owners and operators. Production volumes were approximately 19.8 MBoe/d and 20.4 MBoe/d for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average realized sales price was 39.69 per Boe and 37.72 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in realized sales prices was primarily due to higher commodity prices, Beta returning to production after being offline for the first quarter of 2023 and the release of revenue suspense of 8.4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 13.6 million of cash received on expired commodity derivative instruments compared to 5.1 million of cash paid on expired commodity derivatives for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net gain on commodity derivative instruments of 7.3 million compared to a net loss of 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 62.7 million, of which 54.1 million was used for additions to oil and natural gas properties and 1.0 million for additions to other property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 30.0 million, of which 23.1 million was used for additions to oil and natural gas properties and 0.5 million for additions to other property and equipment. Various restricted investment accounts fund certain long-term contractual and regulatory asset retirement obligations and collateralize certain regulatory bonds associated with our Beta properties. Additions to restricted investments were 7.5 million and 6.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Financing Activities . We had net borrowings of 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to our Revolving Credit Facility compared to net repayments of 70.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Shares withheld for taxes was 1.9 million and 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
