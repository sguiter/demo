 On September 11, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2022 AMA with an effective date of July 1, 2024 (the "First Amendment") that included, among others, the following key revised provisions:

 A revised definition of the Development and Construction Management Fee to include payment of the fee during delays in delivery caused by a casualty event; and 
 A revised definition of Supplemental Fees to include a lease termination fee equal to of the gross rental revenue paid by any tenant of a commercial asset in connection with the early termination of a lease. 
 Except as amended by the First Amendment, the original terms of the 2022 AMA remain in full force and effect. 
 Residential, Commercial, and Parking Property Management Agreements 
 The Company entered into separate residential property management agreements with properties owned by CP Entities under which the Company receives fees to manage and operate the properties, including tenant communications, leasing of apartment units, rent collections, building maintenance and day-to-day operations, engagement and supervision of contractors and vendors providing services for the buildings, and budget preparation and oversight. 
 The Company entered into separate commercial property and parking management agreements with several properties owned by CP Entities under which the Company receives fees to manage and operate the office and retail portions of the properties, including tenant communications, rent collections, building maintenance and day-to-day operations, engagement and supervision of contractors and vendors providing services for the buildings, and budget preparation and oversight. These property management agreements each have initial terms of with successive, automatic renewal terms. The Company generally receives base management fees under these agreements based upon a percentage of gross rental revenues for the portions of the buildings being managed in addition to reimbursement of specified expenses, including employment expenses of personnel employed by the Company in the management and operation of each property. 
 Construction Management Agreements 
 The Company has construction management agreements with properties owned by CP Entities under which the Company receives fees to provide certain construction management and supervision services, including management of tenant buildouts and casualty event remediation and restoration. The Company typically receives a construction management fee that is set forth in the applicable tenant s lease or executed work authorization and based on a percentage of the total costs (or total hard costs) of the project. 
 Lease Procurement Agreements 
 The Company has lease procurement agreements with properties owned by CP Entities under which the Company receives certain finders' fees in connection with the procurement of new leases for such properties where an external broker is not engaged on behalf of the CP Entities. Such leasing fees are supplemental to the fees generated from the Company's management agreements referenced above and are generally - of the future lease payments to be received by the CP Entity from the executed lease. 
 Business Management Agreements 
 On April 30, 2019, CAM entered into a Business Management Agreement with Investors X, whereby CAM provides Investors X with asset and professional services related to the wind down of the Company s divested homebuilding operations and the continuation of services related to the Company s divested land development activities. The aggregate fee payable to CAM from Investors X under the Business Management Agreement, which ended on December 31, 2022, was million payable in quarterly installments of million each. The Company considers Investors X to be a variable interest entity over which it does not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance, therefore it is not the primary beneficiary of Investors X and does not have to consolidate the entity into its financial results. (See Note 3 for additional information). 
 On July 1, 2019, CAM entered into a Business Management Agreement (the BC Management Agreement with CPRES, whereby CAM provides CPRES with professional management and consultation services, including, without limitation, consultation on land development and real estate transactions, for a residential community located in Monteverde, Florida. On January 1, 2023, a successor contract for the BC Management Agreement was executed by DCS Real Estate Investments, LC, an entity controlled by a member of CP.

 renewals. The SH Management Agreement provides that Springfield will reimburse CAM for certain immaterial title, survey, and architectural expenses at cost. 
 The Hartford 
 In December 2019, the Company made an investment related to the purchase of The Hartford, a stabilized commercial office building located at 3101 Wilson Boulevard in the Clarendon area of Arlington, Virginia. In conjunction with the investment, the Company entered into an operating agreement with CP to form Comstock 3101 Wilson, LC, to purchase The Hartford. Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the Company held a minority membership interest of The Hartford and the remaining membership interests of The Hartford are held by CP. 
 In February 2020, the Company, CP and DWF VI 3101 Wilson Member, LLC DWF ), an unaffiliated, third party, equity investor in the Hartford, entered into a limited liability company agreement (the DWC Operating Agreement to form DWC 3101 Wilson Venture, LLC DWC to, among other things, acquire, own and hold all interests in The Hartford. In furtherance thereof, on February 7, 2020, the Original Operating Agreement was amended and restated (the A R Operating Agreement to memorialize the Company s and CP s assignment of of its membership interests in The Hartford to DWC. As a result thereof, DWC is the sole member of the Hartford Owner. The Company and CP, respectively, hold minority membership interests in, and DWF holds the majority membership interest in, DWC. See Note 3 for additional information). 
 BLVD Forty Four/BLVD Ansel 
 In October 2021 and March 2022, the Company entered into joint ventures with CP to acquire BLVD Forty Four and BLVD Ansel, respectively, two adjacent mixed-use luxury high-rise apartment buildings located near the Rockville Metro Station in Rockville, Maryland. The Company considers BLVD Forty Four and BLVD Ansel to be variable interest entities upon which it exercises significant influence; however, considering key factors such as the Company s ownership interest and participation in policy-making decisions by majority equity holders, and oversight of management services by majority equity holders, the Company concluded that the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance is shared. Given that the Company is not the entity most closely associated with the properties, it concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary and does not have a controlling financial interest in either property. (See Note 3 for additional information). 
 In conjunction with the acquisition of Comstock 41, the Company entered into an amendment to the existing asset management agreement with CP to introduce an acquisition pursuit fee of million and contingent entitlement success fee to pursue potential relocation of moderately-priced dwelling units ("MPDUs") from BLVD Forty Four to Comstock 41. The acquisition pursuit fee was earned and recognized as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, upon the completion of the Comstock 41 acquisition. The entitlement success fee, if earned, will equal of the economic value created by the relocation of the MPDUs (subject to reasonable agreed upon changes at the time of the calculation) and due upon approval of a finalized amendment to the existing project development plan by local government agencies. (See Note 3 for additional information). 
 Corporate Leases 
 In November 2020, the Company relocated its corporate headquarters to office space owned and controlled by its Chief Executive Officer Christopher Clemente and his family, pursuant to a lease agreement. In November 2022, the Company executed a square foot lease expansion agreement with terms that align with the original agreement. In January 2022, ParkX Management, LC, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a separate lease agreement with an affiliate controlled and owned by Mr. Clemente and his family to host ParkX's specialized remote monitoring center operations.

 Revenue 
 The following table summarizes revenue by line of business (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Amount Amount Asset management 7,380 56.8 10,606 73.3 (3,226) (30.4) Property management 3,253 25.0 2,605 18.0 648 24.9 Parking management 2,362 18.3 1,252 8.7 1,110 88.7 Total revenue 12,995 100.0 14,463 100.0 (1,468) (10.2) 
 18 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Revenue decreased 10.2 in 2024. The 1.5 million comparative decrease was primarily driven by a 4.8 million decrease in incentive fees earned. A previously scheduled October 1, 2024 incentive fee trigger event date for seven specified managed portfolio assets was deferred. (See Note 12 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Partially offsetting the decrease was a 1.8 million, or 154 , increase in recurring, fee-based revenue from our property and parking management subsidiaries that was driven by the continued expansion of our managed portfolio, as well as a 1.1 million increase in supplemental lease termination fees. 
 Operating costs and expenses 
 The following table summarizes operating costs and expenses (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Cost of revenue 9,583 8,557 1,026 12.0 Selling, general, and administrative 507 575 (68) (11.8) Depreciation and amortization 77 74 3 4.1 Total operating costs and expenses 10,167 9,206 961 10.4 
 Operating costs and expenses increased 10.4 in 2024. The 1.0 million comparative increase was primarily due to a 0.9 million net increase in personnel-related expenses stemming from increased headcount and employee compensation. 
 Other income (expense) 
 The following table summarizes other income (expense) (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Interest income 169 169 N/M Gain (loss) on real estate ventures (75) (241) 166 (68.9) Other income (expense), net 23 1 22 N/M Total other income (expense) 117 (240) 357 (148.8) 
 Other income (expense) changed by 0.4 million in 2024, primarily driven by a 0.2 million net increase in interest income stemming from interest earned on money market sweep accounts that were not active in 2023 and a combined net 0.2 million improvement in mark-to-market valuation impacts of equity method investments in real estate ventures. 
 Income tax 
 Provision for income tax was 0.6 million in 2024, compared to 0.3 million in 2023. The 0.3 million increase primarily stems from a significantly higher annualized estimated tax rate in the current period due to the impact of approximately 1.0 million of additional valuation allowance reversals that occurred in 2023. The impact of the rate increase was partially offset by a decrease in taxable income. 
 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue

 19 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Revenue increased 2.0 in 2024. The 0.7 million comparative increase was primarily driven by a 3.5 million, or 100 , increase in recurring, fee-based revenue from our property and parking management subsidiaries that was driven by the continued expansion of our managed portfolio. Also contributing to the increase was 1.1 million of additional supplemental lease termination fees and a 0.5 million increase in reimbursable staffing charges. Partially offsetting these increases was a 4.8 million decrease in incentive fees earned. A previously scheduled October 1, 2024 incentive fee trigger event date for seven specified managed portfolio assets was deferred. (See Note 12 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

 Operating costs and expenses increased 10.2 in 2024. The 2.7 million increase was primarily due to a 1.7 million net increase in personnel expenses stemming from increased headcount and employee compensation and a net 1.0 million increase in reimbursable/billable expenses. 
 Other income (expense) 
 The following table summarizes other income (expense) (in thousands):

 Other income (expense) changed by 0.8 million in 2024, primarily due to a 0.5 million increase in interest income stemming from interest earned on money market sweep accounts that were not active in 2023 and a combined net 0.4 million improvement in mark-to-market valuation impacts of equity method investments in real estate ventures. 
 Income taxes 
 Provision for income tax was 1.1 million in 2024, compared to 0.6 million in 2023. The 0.5 million increase primarily stems from a significantly higher annualized estimated tax rate in the current period due to the impact of approximately 1.0 million of additional valuation allowance reversals that occurred in 2023. The impact of the rate increase was partially offset by a decrease in taxable income. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we prepare certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), specifically Adjusted EBITDA. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding the impact of interest expense (net of interest income), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and gain (loss) on equity method investments. 
 20 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate financial performance, analyze the underlying trends in our business and establish operational goals and forecasts that are used when allocating resources. We expect to compute Adjusted EBITDA consistently using the same methods each period. 
 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure because it permits investors to better understand changes over comparative periods by providing financial results that are unaffected by certain non-cash items that are not considered by management to be indicative of our operational performance. 
 While we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors when evaluating our business, it is not prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should be considered supplemental in nature. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute, for other financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure as measured in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) 2,377 4,685 4,233 5,914 Interest income (169) (476) Income taxes 568 332 1,135 635 Depreciation and amortization 77 74 218 212 Stock-based compensation 205 273 741 777 (Gain) loss on real estate ventures 75 241 369 720 Adjusted EBITDA 3,133 5,605 6,220 8,258 
 The decreases in Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are primarily driven by higher net income in 2023 due to the recognition of material supplemental incentive fee revenue, which was partially offset by the significant increases in recurring fee-based property and parking management revenue in 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is defined as the current amount of readily available cash and the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the current needs for cash. We assess our liquidity in terms of our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities. 
 Our principal sources of liquidity as of September 30, 2024 were our cash and cash equivalents of 21.1 million and our 10.0 million of available borrowings on our credit facility. 
 Significant factors which could affect future liquidity include the adequacy of available lines of credit, cash flows generated from operating activities, working capital management and investments. 
 Our primary capital needs are for working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes, including investments and capital expenditures. Our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations and distributions from investments in real estate ventures. We have historically financed our operations with internally generated funds and, more rarely and only when necessary, borrowings from our credit facilities. (See Note 5 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). We believe we currently have adequate liquidity and availability of capital to fund our present operations. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 21 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 2,905 (362) 3,267 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (139) (35) (104) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (503) (390) (113) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 2,263 (787) 3,050 
 Operating Activities 
 The 3.3 million increase in net operating cash activity was primarily driven by a 4.9 million incremental cash inflow stemming from changes to our net working capital, partially offset by 1.6 million decrease in net income after adjustments for non-cash items. The net working capital increase was primarily influenced by increased accounts receivable collections. 
 Investing Activities 
 The 0.1 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a 0.4 million increase in purchases of securities to fund non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities, partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in distributions received from investments in real estate ventures. 
 Financing Activities 
 The 0.1 million increase in n et cash used in financing activities was due to a 0.2 million increase in cash paid for taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by 0.1 million of collected proceeds stemming from the issuance of common stock related to equity awards. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not Applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, management, including the CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )). 
 Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no material changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 22 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, therefore internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
