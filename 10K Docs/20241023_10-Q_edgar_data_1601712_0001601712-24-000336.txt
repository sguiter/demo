 Our Sales Platforms 
 _________________________________________________________________ 
 We conduct our operations through a single business segment. Profitability and expenses, including funding costs, credit losses and operating expenses, are managed for the business as a whole. Substantially all of our revenue activities are within the United States. We primarily manage our credit products through five sales platforms (Home Auto, Digital, Diversified Value, Health Wellness and Lifestyle). Those platforms are organized by the types of partners we work with, and are measured on interest and fees on loans, loan receivables, active accounts and other sales metrics.

Our Credit Products 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 Through our sales platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. We also offer our Payment Security program, which is a debt cancellation product. 
 The following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer at September 30, 2024. 
 Promotional Offer Credit Product Standard Terms Only Deferred Interest Other Promotional Total Credit cards 59.2 18.5 14.3 92.0 Commercial credit products 1.8 0.1 1.9 Consumer installment loans 0.2 5.8 6.0 Other 0.1 0.1 Total 61.1 18.7 20.2 100.0 
 Credit Cards 
 We offer the following principal types of credit cards: 
 Private Label Credit Cards. Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe s or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., Synchrony Car Care or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances. Credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended either on standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer. 
 Dual Cards and General Purpose Co-Branded Cards. Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners, and as general purpose credit cards when used to make purchases from other retailers wherever cards from those card networks are accepted or for cash advance transactions. We also offer general purpose co-branded credit cards that do not function as private label credit cards, as well as a Synchrony-branded general purpose credit card. Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards are offered across all of our sales platforms and credit is typically extended on standard terms only. We offer either Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards through over 15 of our large partners, of which the majority are Dual Cards, as well as our CareCredit Dual Card. Consumer Dual Cards and Co-Branded cards totaled 26 of our total loan receivables portfolio at September 30, 2024. 
 Commercial Credit Products 
 We offer private label cards and Dual Cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. 
 Installment Loans 
 We originate secured installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily for power products in our Outdoor market (motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden). We also offer unsecured installment loans primarily in our Home and Auto and Health and Wellness sales platforms and through our various other installment products, such as our Synchrony Pay Later solutions, including pay monthly and pay in 4 products, for short-term loans. Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. Installment loans are generally assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates. Installment loans at September 30, 2024 include loan receivables related to Ally Financial Inc.'s point of sale financing business, ("Ally Lending") that was acquired in March 2024.

Business Trends and Conditions 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 We believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions. For a discussion of certain trends and conditions, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Trends and Conditions in our 2023 Form 10-K. For a discussion of how certain trends and conditions impacted the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, see Results of Operations. 
 CFPB final rule on credit card late fees. 
 On March 5, 2024, the CFPB released a final rule amending its regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act to, among other things, lower the safe harbor dollar amount for credit card late fees from the prior 30 (adjusted to 41 for each subsequent late payment within the next six billing cycles) to 8 and to eliminate the automatic annual inflation adjustment to such safe harbor dollar amount. The final rule, when effective, will result in a significant reduction in our interest and fees on loan receivables. Industry organizations have challenged the final rule in court, and the ultimate outcome of such challenge, including the impact on the final rule, is uncertain. The final rule had an original effective date of May 14, 2024; however, on May 10, 2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted an injunction and stay of the final rule, and the injunction granted remains in effect. 
 Due to the pending litigation discussed above, which has resulted in a delay in the final rule s effective date, it remains uncertain whether the final rule will become effective in 2024. As a result, the magnitude of the adverse effects to our results of operations in 2024 also remains uncertain. 
 In anticipation that the final rule will become effective, we are in the process of implementing a number of product, policy and pricing changes to adjust for the significant reduction in our late fee income. The effects of these changes have started to be reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 While we continue to believe that over time, the strategies we have identified and are in the process of implementing will fully offset the decline in late fee income resulting from an effective final rule, it may take time for such product, policy and pricing changes to offset the expected reduction in late fees. In addition, we expect that upon the final rule becoming effective, the combined net effects of the final rule and our mitigating strategies would result in a decrease in payments to partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements. However, the effects of the final rule are also subject to other factors that could increase the adverse effects to our results of operations, including our ability to successfully implement the product, policy and pricing changes we have identified, as well as any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to these changes or the final rule itself. 
 For a discussion of risks related to a CFPB final late fee rule, please see Risk Factors Relating to our Business The CFPB s proposed rule on credit card late fees, if adopted, would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations , in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Growth in loan receivables and interest income. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a decrease in purchase volume of 4.3 compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by lower consumer spending and the impacts from credit actions we have taken across our portfolio where we have seen indications of higher probability of default. We expect these same factors to now result in a low single digit decrease in purchase volume for the year ending December 31, 2024. As a result, while we still anticipate loan receivables to increase for the remainder of 2024, we expect the rate of growth to moderate. 
 All of the factors discussed above and in our 2023 Form 10-K, such as customer payment behavior and the CFPB final rule on credit card late fees, will continue to have an effect on our loan receivables and interest income. For additional discussion of those factors, please see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Trends and Conditions-CFPB final rule on credit card late fees" and " Growth in loan receivables and interest income in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

10 

Seasonality 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 We experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables typically occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down. 
 The seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. 
 In addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates, resulting in higher net charge-off rates in the first half of the calendar year. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status, resulting in lower net charge-off rates in the second half of the calendar year. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, even in instances of improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends. 
 However, in addition to these seasonal trends, the moderation in customer payment behavior from the previously elevated levels we experienced in recent periods, has also significantly impacted our key financial metrics, such as our net charge-off rate, and also the fluctuations experienced between quarterly periods. The effects from these changes in customer payment behavior have resulted and may continue to result in either partial, or in some instances full, offset to the impact from the ongoing seasonal trends discussed above.

Results of Operations 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 Highlights for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 Below are highlights of our performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as applicable, except as otherwise noted. 
 Net earnings increased to 789 million from 628 million and to 2.7 billion from 1.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher net interest income and lower retailer share arrangements, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the after-tax gain on sale related to Pets Best of 802 million, as well as the same trends experienced in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Loan receivables increased 4.4 to 102.2 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 97.9 billion at September 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower customer payment rates and the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition, partially offset by lower purchase volume. 
 Net interest income increased 5.7 to 4.6 billion and 7.1 to 13.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Interest and fees on loans increased 7.2 and 10.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables, the impact of our product, pricing and policy changes and lower payment rate, partially offset by higher reversals. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 18.5 and 33.8 , respectively, due to higher benchmark rates and higher interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Retailer share arrangements decreased 6.6 to 914 million and 10.6 to 2.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to higher net charge-offs. 
 Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased 38 basis points to 4.78 at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. The net charge-off rate increased 146 basis points to 6.06 and increased 164 basis points to 6.26 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Provision for credit losses increased by 109 million, or 7.3 , and 1.0 billion, or 24.3 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by lower reserve builds. The reserve build in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 180 million related to the Ally Lending acquisition. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loan receivables) increased to 10.79 at September 30, 2024, as compared to 10.40 at September 30, 2023. 
 Other income increased by 27 million to 119 million, and by 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the impact of our product, pricing and policy change related fees, partially offset by the impact of the Pets Best disposition and venture investment gains and losses. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the 1.1 billion gain on sale related to the Pets Best disposition. 
 Other expense increased by 35 million, or 3.0 , and 130 million, or 3.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by costs related to the Ally Lending acquisition, technology investments, and preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule change, partially offset by lower operational losses. 
 At September 30, 2024, deposits represented 84 of our total funding sources. Total deposits increased by 1.4 to 82.3 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared and paid cash dividends totaling 51 million on our Series A 5.625 fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and our Series B 8.250 fixed rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 900 million of our outstanding common stock, and declared and paid cash dividends of 0.75 per share, or 301 million in the aggregate. In April 2024, the Board of Directors approved an incremental share repurchase program of up to 1.0 billion, through June 30, 2025, and maintained the quarterly dividend at its current amount of 0.25 per common share. At September 30, 2024 we had a total share repurchase authorization of 700 million remaining. For more information, see Capital Dividend and Share Repurchases. 
 In March 2024, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pets Best, for consideration comprising a combination of cash and an equity interest in Independence Pet Holdings, Inc. The sale resulted in the recognition of a gain on sale of 1.1 billion, or 802 million net of tax. 
 In March 2024, we acquired Ally Lending for cash consideration of 2.0 billion. The assets and liabilities of Ally Lending primarily included loan receivables with an unpaid principal balance of 2.2 billion. See Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.

For a summary description of the composition of our key line items included in our Statements of Earnings, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased by 431 million, or 8.1 , and 1.8 billion, or 11.7 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by increases in interest and fees on loans of 7.2 and 10.5 , respectively. The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in interest and fees on loans were primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables, the impact of our product, pricing and policy changes and lower customer payment rates, partially offset by higher reversals. 
 Average interest-earning assets 
 Three months ended September 30 in millions) 2024 2023 Loan receivables, including held for sale 102,009 83.7 96,230 85.4 Liquidity portfolio and other 19,903 16.3 16,459 14.6 Total average interest-earning assets 121,912 100.0 112,689 100.0

 Average loan receivables, including held for sale, increased 6.0 and 8.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by lower customer payment rates and the impact of the Ally Lending acquisition, partially offset by lower purchase volume. Purchase volume decreased by 4.3 and 1.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, reflecting lower consumer spend as well as the impact of credit actions, partially offset by the Ally Lending acquisition. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also partially offset by growth in average active accounts of 1.7 . 
 Yield on average interest-earning assets 
 The yield on average interest-earning assets increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to increases in the yield on average loan receivables. The loan receivable yield increased 30 basis points for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 21.54 and 21.21 , respectively. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 184 million to 1.2 billion, and 888 million to 3.5 billion, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to higher benchmark rates and higher interest-bearing liabilities. Our cost of funds increased to 4.78 and 4.77 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4.34 and 3.95 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income increased by 247 million, or 5.7 , and 886 million, or 7.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, resulting from the changes in interest income and interest expense discussed above. 
 Retailer Share Arrangements 
 Retailer share arrangements decreased by 65 million, or 6.6 , and 295 million, or 10.6 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to higher net charge-offs. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Provision for credit losses increased by 109 million, or 7.3 , and 1.0 billion, or 24.3 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by lower reserve builds in the current year. The net charge-off rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 146 basis points to 6.06 , as compared to the prior year period, and was 97 basis points above the average of the third quarters of 2017 through 2019. The reserve build in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 180 million related to the Ally Lending acquisition. 
 Other Income 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interchange revenue 256 267 760 761 Protection product revenue 145 131 411 371 Loyalty programs (346) (358) (1,011) (1,001) Other 64 52 1,233 87 Total other income 119 92 1,393 218 
 Other income increased by 27 million to 119 million, and 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the impact of our product, pricing and policy change related fees across all five of our sales platforms. This impact was partially offset by lower commission fees following the Pets Best disposition in March 2024 and venture investment losses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net investment gains recognized in the prior year period. 
 The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the gain on sale related to the Pets Best disposition. The pre-tax gain amount of 1.1 billion is included within the Other component of Other Income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Other Expense 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Employee costs 464 444 1,394 1,346 Professional fees 231 219 687 614 Marketing and business development 123 125 377 389 Information processing 203 177 596 522 Other 168 189 518 571 Total other expense 1,189 1,154 3,572 3,442 
 Other expense increased by 35 million, or 3.0 and by 130 million, or 3.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 The increase in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by costs related to the Ally Lending acquisition, technology investments, and preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule change, partially offset by lower operational losses. Technology investments primarily reflect higher amortization of capitalized software expenditures. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Effective tax rate 23.2 24.6 23.9 24.0 Provision for income taxes 239 205 855 567 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters in the current period. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased slightly compared to the same period in the prior year. For both periods presented, the effective tax rate differs from the applicable U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes.

Platform Analysis 
 As discussed above under Our Sales Platforms , we offer our credit products primarily through five sales platforms (Home Auto, Digital, Diversified Value, Health Wellness and Lifestyle), which management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. The following is a discussion of certain supplemental information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for each of our five sales platforms and Corp, Other. 
 Home Auto 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Purchase volume 11,361 12,273 34,369 35,989 Period-end loan receivables 32,542 31,648 32,542 31,648 Average loan receivables, including held for sale 32,613 31,239 32,358 30,386 Average active accounts (in thousands) 19,157 19,223 19,136 18,894 Interest and fees on loans 1,489 1,367 4,290 3,867 Other income 56 28 127 80 
 Home Auto interest and fees on loans increased by 122 million, or 8.9 , and increased by 423 million, or 10.9 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher average loan receivables and higher benchmark rates. The increase in average loan receivables for both periods primarily reflects the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition as well as the impact of lower customer payment rates, partially offset by lower purchase volume. Purchase volume decreased 7.4 and 4.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the impact of the Ally Lending acquisition was more than offset by a combination of lower consumer traffic, fewer large ticket purchases and the impact of credit actions. 
 Other income increased by 28 million, or 100.0 , and 47 million, or 58.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to the impact of product, pricing and policy change related fees, lower loyalty costs and higher protection product revenue.

 Digital interest and fees on loans increased by 63 million, or 4.1 , and 389 million, or 9.0 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher average loan receivables, lower payment rates and higher benchmark rates. Purchase volume decreased by 3.3 and 0.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by lower consumer spend per account and the impact of credit actions. Average active accounts remained flat and increased by 1.9 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 Diversified Value interest and fees on loans increased by 41 million, or 3.5 , and 259 million, or 7.8 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by growth in average loan receivables, lower payment rates and higher benchmark rates. Purchase volume decreased by 2.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by lower consumer spend per account and the impact of credit actions. Purchase volume remained flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Average active accounts decreased by 2.2 and 0.6 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 Health Wellness interest and fees on loans increased by 112 million, or 13.3 , and 371 million, or 15.7 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by higher average loan receivables. The growth in average loan receivables for both periods reflected higher purchase volume over the last 12 months and lower customer payment rates, as well as the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition. Purchase volume decreased 3.1 , and average active accounts increased 7.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as lower spend in Dental, Cosmetic and Vision, combined with the impact of credit actions, was partially offset by growth in Pet and Audiology. Purchase volume increased 2.1 , and average active accounts increased 9.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting growth in Pet and Audiology, partially offset by lower spend in Vision and Dental. 
 Other income decreased by 6 million, or 8.1 , and 7 million, or 3.7 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to lower commission fees following the Pets Best disposition, partially offset by higher protection product revenue and the impact of product, pricing and policy change related fees.

Loan Receivables 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 Loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenue. The following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policie s and Note 5. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our loan receivables. 
 The following table sets forth the composition of our loan receivables portfolio by product type at the dates indicated. 
 in millions) At September 30, 2024 
 At December 31, 2023 
 Loan receivables 
 Credit cards 94,008 92.0 97,043 94.2 Consumer installment loans 6,125 6.0 3,977 3.9 Commercial credit products 1,936 1.9 1,839 1.8 Other 124 0.1 129 0.1 Total loan receivables 
 102,193 100.0 102,988 100.0 
 Loan receivables decreased 0.8 to 102.2 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 103.0 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the seasonality of our business and lower purchase volume, partially offset by the Ally Lending acquisition and lower customer payment rates. Loan receivables related to the Ally Lending acquisition are included within Consumer installment loans at September 30, 2024 in the table above. 
 Loan receivables increased 4.4 to 102.2 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 97.9 billion at September 30, 2023 driven by lower customer payment rates and the completion of the Ally Lending acquisition, partially offset by lower purchase volume. 
 Our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at September 30, 2024. 
 in millions) Loan Receivables Outstanding of Total Loan Receivables Outstanding State Texas 11,273 11.0 California 10,513 10.3 Florida 9,521 9.3 New York 4,865 4.8 North Carolina 4,300 4.2 
 Delinquencies 
 Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased to 4.78 at September 30, 2024 from 4.40 at September 30, 2023, and increased from 4.74 at December 31, 2023. These increases were primarily driven by lower customer payment rates. 
 Net Charge-Offs 
 Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for credit losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in Other expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
 24 

The table below sets forth the net charge-offs and ratio of annualized net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, net charge-off rate for the periods indicated.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses totaled 11.0 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 10.6 billion at December 31, 2023, respectively, and 10.2 billion at September 30, 2023, and reflects our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan receivables on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total period end loan receivables increased to 10.79 at September 30, 2024, from 10.26 at December 31, 2023 and increased from 10.40 at September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in allowance for credit losses compared to December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 includes the addition of the Ally Lending portfolio. See Note 5. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Funding, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. Our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. 
 Funding Sources 
 Our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and senior and subordinated unsecured notes. 
 The following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated: 2024 2023 Three months ended September 30 in millions) Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate Deposits (1) 
 82,100 83.9 4.7 75,952 83.7 4.2 Securitized financings 7,817 8.0 5.5 6,096 6.7 5.6 Senior and subordinated unsecured notes 7,968 8.1 5.0 8,710 9.6 4.8 Total 97,885 100.0 4.8 90,758 100.0 4.3 ______________________ 
 (1) Excludes 387 million and 401 million average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Non-interest-bearing deposits comprise less than 10 of total deposits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 (1) Excludes 391 million and 410 million average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Non-interest-bearing deposits comprise less than 10 of total deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Deposits 
 We obtain deposits directly from retail, affinity relationships and commercial customers direct deposits or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers brokered deposits ). At September 30, 2024, we had 71.6 billion in direct deposits and 10.7 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to utilize our direct deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low-cost funding. 
 Our direct deposits are primarily from retail customers and include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts, savings accounts, sweep and affinity deposits. 
 Brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with 10 brokers that offer our deposits through their networks. Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate. These deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal. 
 26 

Our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. To mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed and uncommitted capacity) and unsecured debt. 
 The following table summarizes certain information regarding our interest-bearing deposits by type (all of which constitute U.S. deposits) for the periods indicated:

 Our deposit liabilities provide funding with maturities ranging from one day to ten years. At September 30, 2024, the weighted average maturity of our interest-bearing time deposits was one year. See Note 8. Deposits to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on the maturities of our time deposits.

 (2) The standard deposit insurance amount is 250,000 per depositor, for each account ownership category. Deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limit presented above include partially insured accounts. Our estimate of the uninsured portion of these deposit balances at September 30, 2024 was approximately 6.0 billion.

Securitized Financings 
 We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Synchrony Card Issuance Trust SYNIT through which we may issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. In addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust SYNCT and the Synchrony Sales Finance Master Trust SFT ). 
 The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in securitized financings, excluding debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs at September 30, 2024.

 ______________________ 
 (1) Excludes any subordinated classes of SYNIT notes that we owned at September 30, 2024. 
 We retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of SYNCT, SFT and SYNIT, subordinated retained interests in the loan receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari passu seller s interest in each trust and (ii) in the case of SYNIT, any subordinated classes of notes that we own. 
 All of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the Bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents, failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related securitization depositor, Synchrony (solely with respect to SYNCT) or the Bank. In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series or for the trust, as applicable, falls below zero. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business. The occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. No early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in SYNCT, SFT or SYNIT.

The following table summarizes for each of our trusts the three-month rolling average excess spread at September 30, 2024.

 Senior and Subordinated Unsecured Notes 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made repayments totaling 1.85 billion of senior unsecured notes issued by Synchrony Financial. 
 The following table provides a summary of our outstanding fixed rate senior and subordinated unsecured notes at September 30, 2024, which includes 750 million of senior unsecured notes issued by Synchrony Financial in August 2024.

Short-Term Borrowings 
 Except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented. 
 
 Covenants 
 The indentures pursuant to which our senior and subordinated unsecured notes have been issued include various covenants. If we do not satisfy any of these covenants, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities. 
 Credit Ratings 
 Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities. 
 The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks: 
 S P Fitch Ratings Synchrony Financial Senior unsecured debt BBB- BBB- Subordinated unsecured debt BB+ BB+ Preferred stock BB- B+ Outlook for Synchrony Financial Stable Positive Synchrony Bank Senior unsecured debt BBB BBB- Outlook for Synchrony Bank Stable Positive 
 In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNIT are rated by Fitch, S P and/or Moody s. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets. 
 
 Liquidity 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions. 
 We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset and Liability Management Committee, a management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs. 
 We maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at September 30, 2024 had 19.7 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to 16.8 billion of liquid assets at December 31, 2023. The increase in liquid assets was primarily due to deposit growth and the issuances of securitized debt and preferred stock, as well as the proceeds from the Pets Best disposition. We believe our liquidity position at September 30, 2024 remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change. 
 30 

As a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions. 
 We also have access to several additional sources of liquidity beyond our liquidity portfolio. At September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 11.4 billion of available borrowing capacity through the Federal Reserve s discount window. In addition, we had 2.7 billion of undrawn capacity on our securitized financings, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our securitization programs, of which 2.2 billion was committed and 450 million was uncommitted, as well as 500 million of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders. We also have other unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window. 
 We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank s ability to pay dividends, see Regulation Risk Factors Relating to Regulation We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness and Regulation Regulation Relating to Our Business Savings Association Regulation Dividends and Stock Repurchases in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Capital 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 Our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our business, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders. 
 Beginning in 2024, we are now subject to the Federal Reserve Board's formal capital plan submission requirements and have submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 900 million of common stock as part of our 2023 share repurchase program. In April 2024, the Board of Directors approved an incremental share repurchase program of up to 1.0 billion through June 30, 2025 (the "2024 plan"). At September 30, 2024, 700 million of the authorization capacity under the 2024 plan remained outstanding. Repurchases under this program are subject to market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals, if any. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial 
 As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more information, see Regulation Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At September 30, 2024, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized. 
 32 

The following table sets forth the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Basel III At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 in millions) Amount Ratio (1) 
 Amount Ratio (1) 
 Total risk-based capital 16,864 16.4 15,464 14.9 Tier 1 risk-based capital 14,723 14.3 13,334 12.9 Tier 1 leverage 14,723 12.5 13,334 11.7 Common equity Tier 1 capital 13,501 13.1 12,600 12.2 Risk-weighted assets 103,103 103,460 
 ______________________ 
 (1) Tier 1 leverage ratio represents total Tier 1 capital as a percentage of total average assets, after certain adjustments. All other ratios presented above represent the applicable capital measure as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. 
 The Company elected to adopt the option provided by the interim final rule issued by joint federal bank regulatory agencies, which largely delayed the effects of CECL on our regulatory capital. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the effects are being phased-in over a three-year transitional period through 2024, collectively the CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment . The effects of CECL on our regulatory capital will be fully phased-in beginning in the first quarter of 2025. For more information, see Capital Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Capital amounts and ratios in the above table all reflect the applicable CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment for each period. The increase in our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the retention of net earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the net impact of the Pets Best disposition and Ally Lending acquisition, partially offset by the third year phase-in of the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Bank 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank s capital ratios calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and also reflects the applicable CECL regulatory capital transition adjustment for each period. 
 At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Minimum to be Well-Capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Ratio Total risk-based capital 15,583 15.9 14,943 15.3 10.0 Tier 1 risk-based capital 13,499 13.8 12,880 13.2 8.0 Tier 1 leverage 13,499 12.1 12,880 12.0 5.0 Common equity Tier 1 capital 13,499 13.8 12,880 13.2 6.5 
 Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Regulation Risk Factors Relating to Regulation Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Unfunded Lending Commitments 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. At September 30, 2024, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position related to any guarantees. See Note 6 - Variable Interest Entities to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our investment commitments for unconsolidated variable interest entities VIE's ). 
 We extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. Each unused credit card line is unconditionally cancellable by us. See Note 5 - Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, or material changes to our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, among other effects. See Management's Discussion and Analysis Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Form 10-K, for a detailed discussion of these critical accounting estimates. 
 
 Regulation and Supervision 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending and collection practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel. Such laws and regulations directly and indirectly affect key drivers of our profitability, including, for example, capital and liquidity, product offerings, risk management, and costs of compliance. 
 As a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. 
 The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. 
 On March 5, 2024, the CFPB released a final rule amending its regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act to, among other things, lower the safe harbor dollar amount for credit card late fees from the prior 30 (adjusted to 41 for each subsequent late payment within the next six billing cycles) to 8 and to eliminate the automatic annual inflation adjustment to such safe harbor dollar amount. The final rule had an original effective date of May 14, 2024. Industry organizations have challenged the final rule in court, and on May 10, 2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted an injunction and stay of the final rule, and the injunction granted remains in effect. The final outcome of such challenge, including the impact on the final rule, is uncertain. See "Business Trends and Conditions" above for the anticipated financial impacts related to the final rule. 
 34 

On June 20, 2024, the FDIC released a final rule imposing additional requirements for the content of resolution plans submitted by insured depository institutions with 100 billion or more in total assets, including the Bank, following the rule s effective date of October 1, 2024. Under the final rule, if the FDIC deems a resolution plan filing not credible and the insured depository institution fails to resubmit a credible plan, the institution could become subject to an enforcement action. Our first resolution plan under the final rule is due on July 1, 2025 and we will be required to file a resolution plan once every three years thereafter. Additionally, we will be required to submit interim supplements annually. We are evaluating the impact of the final rule. 
 On July 30, 2024, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would revise the FDIC s regulations governing the classification and treatment of brokered deposits. The proposal would, among other changes, broaden the definition of deposit broker to include agents that place or facilitate the placement of third-party deposits at only one insured depository institution and agents that receive a fee or other remuneration in exchange for the placement of deposits. In addition, the proposal would narrow the exception to the definition of deposit broker for agents whose primary purpose is not the placement of funds with depository institutions. While we are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule, if the rule is finalized as proposed, the Bank may be required to classify a greater amount of its deposits obtained with the involvement of third parties as brokered deposits. An increase in the amount of brokered deposits on the Bank s balance sheet could, among other consequences, increase the Bank s deposit insurance assessment costs. 
 On September 10, 2024, the Vice Chair for Supervision at the Federal Reserve Board (the "Vice Chair"), gave a speech outlining a set of potential revisions to the July 2023 interagency proposed rule to revise the U.S. regulatory capital framework (known as the Basel Endgame proposal). In the speech, the Vice Chair indicated that he will recommend that the Federal Reserve Board issue a re-proposal of the rule in which banking organizations with total assets between 100 billion and 250 billion, such as Synchrony, would not be subject to the changes to their capital requirements that were included in the July 2023 Basel Endgame proposal, other than the proposed requirement to recognize unrealized gains and losses of their securities in regulatory capital. It remains uncertain whether the federal banking agencies will re-propose the Basel Endgame rule, and if so, whether the agencies will adopt the Vice Chair s recommendations. 
 On September 17, 2024, the OCC finalized a new Policy Statement Regarding Statutory Factors Under the Bank Merger Act (the Policy Statement ), which outlines factors that the OCC will consider when evaluating a proposed bank merger transaction. Also on September 17, 2024, the United States Department of Justice (the DOJ withdrew its 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and announced that it will instead evaluate the competitive impact of bank mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines that the DOJ applies to mergers in all industries. Compared to the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, the 2023 Merger Guidelines set forth more stringent concentration limits and add several largely qualitative bases on which the DOJ may challenge a merger. While the effect of these changes for particular transactions remains unclear, both the Policy Statement and the change in the DOJ s bank merger antitrust policy may make it more difficult and/or costly for us to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or may otherwise result in more onerous conditions to obtain approval for an acquisition. 
 See Regulation Regulation Relating to Our Business in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on regulations that apply to us, and Capital above, for discussion of the impact of regulations and supervision on our capital and liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock.

 billion. This acquisition deepens our presence and reach in the home improvement and health and wellness sectors, including high-growth specialty areas such as roofing, HVAC, and windows, as well as in cosmetic, audiology, and dentistry. 
 The Ally Lending acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. 
 There were no adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (measurement period adjustments) related to the acquisition during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, measurement period adjustments were recognized related to the acquisition as detailed in the table below. 
 Loan receivables (a) 
 ) Intangible assets, net ) Other assets Total ) Liabilities assumed Other liabilities ) ) Total net identifiable assets acquired ) Less: Total cash consideration paid Goodwill _______________________ 

The amounts above represent the estimated fair values of the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The estimated fair values reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date. The measurement period adjustments reflected above did not result from events occurring subsequent to the acquisition date. 
 The valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is substantially complete and will be finalized no later than one year after the acquisition date. The goodwill recognized related to the acquisition is tax-deductible and reflects the expected synergies and operational efficiencies arising from the transaction.

billion. These loan receivables are reported within Consumer installment loans in Note 5. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses . To determine the provisional fair value of loans at acquisition, we estimate expected cash flows and discount those cash flows using an observable market rate of interest, when available, adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value. In determining fair value, expected cash flows are adjusted to include prepayment, default rate, and loss severity estimates. The difference between the fair value and the amount contractually due is recorded as a loan discount or premium at acquisition. Including the impact of measurement period adjustments, the provisional loan discount at the acquisition date was million, which is to be amortized into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loans, as described within Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within our 2023 Form 10-K. The interest and fees related to the acquired business are included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings subsequent to the acquisition date and totaled million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These amounts include amortization of the loan discount recognized at acquisition of million and million, respectively. Expense activities, including those associated with the acquired business, are managed for the Company as a whole. 
 Loans acquired without a more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination are measured under the Allowance for Credit Losses model, as described within Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within our 2023 Form 10-K. The Company s best estimate of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected at the date of acquisition was million, which is included within our allowance for credit losses, and recognized through provision for credit losses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Included in the acquisition was million of loans that have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination (referred to as purchased credit deteriorated or PCD assets) that were not immediately written off at the acquisition date and are subject to specific guidance upon acquisition. An allowance for PCD assets of million was recorded at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, the accounting for the PCD assets will generally follow the Allowance for Credit Losses model described within Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Pets Best 
 In March 2024, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pets Best Insurance Services, LLC Pets Best to Poodle Holdings, Inc. Buyer for consideration comprising a combination of cash and an equity interest of less than in Independence Pet Holdings, Inc., ("IPH") an affiliate of Buyer. In connection with the sale, IPH also appointed Synchrony executives to its board of directors. The sale of Pets Best resulted in the recognition of a gain on sale of billion or million, net of tax in the three months ended March 31, 2024. The pre-tax gain amount has been recognized within the Other component of Other Income in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
 The Company s initial equity investment in IPH was recorded in Other Assets on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The investment was recorded at its estimated fair value at the date acquired of million. The estimated fair value at acquisition date was determined using a weighted average methodology of approaches: a market approach which includes using a multiple of projected revenues, precedent transactions and an intrinsic value analysis. The market-multiple approach was established based on a selected group of publicly traded companies. The use of selected precedent transaction multiples was calibrated to the valuation outcome using the market approach. Intrinsic value analysis determines implied multiples primarily based upon recent market studies and forecasted performance. The change in the carrying value of our equity investment in IPH subsequent to the date acquired was not material.

 The reasonable and supportable forecast period used in our estimate of credit losses at September 30, 2024 was months, consistent with the forecast period utilized since the adoption of CECL. Beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we revert to historical loss information at the loan receivables segment level over a period, gradually increasing the weight of historical losses by an equal amount each month during the reversion period, and utilize historical loss information thereafter for the remaining life of the portfolio. The reversion period and methodology remain unchanged since the adoption of CECL.

 Unfunded Lending Commitments 
 We manage the potential risk in credit commitments by limiting the total amount of credit, both by individual customer and in total, by monitoring the size and maturity of our portfolios and by applying the same credit standards for all of our credit products.

 (b) 
 We establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken (or expected to be taken) on an income tax return and the amount of taxes recognized in our financial statements. The liability associated with the unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically when new information becomes available. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible to be resolved in the next twelve months is expected to be million, of which million, if recognized, would reduce the Company's tax expense and effective tax rate. 
 In the current year, the Company executed a Memorandum of Understanding with the IRS to participate voluntarily in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process CAP program for the 2024 tax year, and thus the tax year is under IRS review. The IRS is also examining our 2023 tax year, and we expect the review will be completed in the current year. Additionally, we are under examination in various states going back to 2014. 
 We believe that there are no issues or claims that are likely to significantly impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties that could result from such examinations.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. 
 We borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers. Changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease, as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks. The interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally the prime rate, and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), U.S. Treasury bills, or the federal funds rate. The prime rate and the SOFR, U.S. Treasury bills or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities. 
 The following table presents the approximate net interest income impacts forecasted over the next twelve months from an immediate and parallel change in interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024. 
 Basis Point Change At September 30, 2024 in millions) -100 basis points (223) +100 basis points 72 
 For a more detailed discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), and based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 No change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
