Future regulation or changes by the card brand payment networks could have a substantial impact on interchange rates and the Company s revenue from VCC transactions. If interchange rates decline, whether due to actions by the card brand payment networks or future regulation, or if merchant/suppliers elect to receive payments that result in lower or no interchange revenue such as check or apply fees in consideration of accepting electronic forms of payment, the Company s total operating revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business could be materially affected. The Company s revenue from VCC transactions is also impacted by fees charged by service providers to process our VCC transactions.

The Company historically transmitted buyer customer funds using a legacy model pursuant to which buyer customer funds were held in trust accounts that were maintained and operated by a trustee pending distribution to suppliers in accordance with instructions provided through the Company s platform. The Company is not the trustee or beneficiary of the trusts which hold these buyer deposits; accordingly, the Company does not record these assets and offsetting liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company has largely phased out this model although certain banks that resell its products and services continue to leverage a similar structure. The Company contractually earns interest on funds held for certain buyers. The amount of Company and bank customer funds held in all trust-related and similar accounts was approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has transitioned most payment transmission activity to the money transmitter license model and obtained a money transmitter license in all states which require licensure. This model enables AvidXchange to provide commercial payment services to businesses through its for the benefit of customer bank accounts, also known as FBO, that are restricted for such purposes. The restricted funds held for customers are restricted for the purpose of satisfying the customer s supplier obligations and are not available for general business use by the Company. The Company maintains these funds in liquid cash accounts and contractually earns interest on these funds held for customers. These funds are recognized as a restricted cash asset and a corresponding liability is recorded for payments due to their suppliers on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Restricted funds held for customers are included in the cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

 of this guidance on did t have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements . Accounting Pronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires significant additional disclosures about income taxes, primarily focused on the disclosure of income taxes paid and the rate reconciliation table. The new guidance will be applied prospectively (with retrospective application permitted) and is effective for calendar year-end public business entities in the 2025 annual period and in 2026 for interim periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial statements. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. This standard is intended to require more detailed disclosures about specified categories of expenses included in certain expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The amendments may be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or (2) retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial statements.

Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. These revenues are subject to future economic risks including customer cancellations, bankruptcies, regulatory changes and other market factors. The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 ), paragraph 606-10-50-14(b) and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations related to transaction and processing services that qualify for recognition in accordance with paragraph 606-10-55-18 of Topic 606. These contracts contain variable consideration for stand-ready performance obligations for which the exact quantity and mix of transactions to be processed are contingent upon buyer or supplier request. These contracts also contain fixed fees and non-refundable upfront fees; however, these amounts are not considered material to total consolidated revenue.

As of December 31, 2023 

Contract Costs The Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract, as well as costs to fulfill a contract with buyer customers that are expected to be recovered. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions incurred if a contract is obtained, and customer implementation related costs. The Company utilizes a portfolio approach when estimating the amortization of contract acquisition and fulfillment costs. These costs are amortized on a over the expected benefit period of generally , which was determined by taking into consideration customer attrition rates, estimated terms of customer relationships, useful lives of technology, industry peers, and other factors. The amortization of contract fulfillment costs associated with implementation activities are recorded as cost of revenues in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The amortization of contract acquisition costs associated with sales commissions that qualify for capitalization is recorded as sales and marketing expense in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are classified as deferred customer origination costs in the Company s consolidated balance sheets.

________________ 

(1 
 Money market funds are classified as cash equivalents in the Company s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. As short-term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash with remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, the Company s cash equivalent money market funds have carrying values that approximate fair value. 

(2) 
 Fair value of insurance policies represents their cash surrender value based on the underlying investments in the account which is determined based on quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in active markets. 

as of September 30, 2024 . As the Company invests in short-term and high credit quality marketable securities, the Company expects to receive fixed par value without any loss of principle at the maturity of each security. Therefore, an allowance for expected credit losses is not recognized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 .

(the "Borrowers"), entered into a credit agreement (the "2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") with KeyBank National Association ("KeyBank") to amend and restate in its entirety its previous senior secured credit facility (as amended, the "2022 Credit Agreement"), dated as of December 29, 2022. The Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the term loan facility under the 2022 Credit Agreement upon closing the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement has a term of and consists of a 150,000 revolving credit facility (the "2024 Revolver"). Under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and subject to specific conditions, the Company may request, and the lenders have the right, but not the obligation, to increase the 2024 Revolver or add a term loan facility by an additional amount (for all such increases) not to exceed 150,000, for a total aggregate amount of 300,000. The 2024 Revolver may be used for working capital, for refinancing existing indebtedness, and for other general corporate purposes.

 letters of credit were outstanding. The maturity date for the 2024 Revolver is . Interest only payments are required during the term, with the outstanding principal balance due in full upon maturity. Interest is payable quarterly. The Company may voluntarily pre-pay all or any part of the 2024 Revolver along with accrued interest and any applicable breakage costs, without premium or penalty. Interest on the loans under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is equal to the daily simple secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR"), term SOFR or a base rate, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is between and for daily simple SOFR and term SOFR loans (plus a SOFR adjustment of ), and between and for base rate loans. The applicable margin fluctuates based on a leverage ratio that reflects the Company's consolidated funded indebtedness to the Company's consolidated EBITDA. The Company may elect one-, three- or six-month interest periods in connection with term SOFR. The base rate is equal to the higher of KeyBank s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus , or term SOFR plus . For purposes of the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement , daily simple SOFR, term SOFR and the base rate will never be less than . The 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. The affirmative covenants require the Company to provide the lenders with certain financial statements, budgets, compliance certificates and other documents and reports and to comply with certain laws. The negative covenants restrict the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create additional liens on its assets, make certain investments, dispose of its assets or engage in a merger or other similar transaction or engage in transactions with affiliates, which are subject, in each case, to the various exceptions and conditions described in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The negative covenants further restrict the Company s ability to make certain restricted payments, including the payment of dividends in certain circumstances and repurchase of common equity in excess of 50,000 shares in any fiscal year. and (2) of the Revolving Amount, as defined in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, (b) as of the end of each such quarter, total revenue on a trailing four-quarter basis must be greater than the requirements set forth in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and (c) for each period of four consecutive quarters, Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement , must not be less than . Second, during the period commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2025 until maturity, (i) the Leverage Ratio, as defined in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement , must not exceed to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter and (ii) the Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement , must not be less than to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Leverage Ratio must not exceed to 1.00 during certain periods following an acquisition of a certain size. The 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also includes certain customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders are entitled to take various actions, including the charging of a default rate of interest, accelerating the maturity of all loans and taking all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor with respect to the collateral for the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and under applicable law. The obligations under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured by: substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Company and its material subsidiaries, except for existing real estate, client funds, client funds accounts, and other excluded accounts (as such terms are defined in the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), and 

 the capital stock of the Company s material subsidiaries. 

 Under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, AvidXchange, Inc. and AFV Commerce, Inc., are the only borrowers, and AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. and certain subsidiaries of AvidXchange, Inc. and AFV Commerce, Inc. are co-guarantors. Revolving Credit Facility There was balance outstanding under the 2024 Revolver as of September 30, 2024 . The Company is required to pay on a quarterly basis a commitment fee of between and per annum as determined by the Leverage Ratio, with respect to the amount of the 2024 Revolver during the term of the agreement.

 You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed with the SEC, with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words we, our, us, AvidXchange, and our Company refer to AvidXchange, Inc. prior to our reorganization, and to AvidXchange Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries following the reorganization, unless the context requires otherwise. 
 Overview 
 AvidXchange was founded in 2000 to serve the AP automation needs of the middle market. In 2012, in response to customer demand for more efficient payment methods, we launched the AvidPay Network. Since 2012, we have had substantial growth, both organic and through a series of strategic acquisitions allowing us to expand in the markets that we serve and enter new ones. 
 Our Business and Revenue Model 
 We sell our solutions through a hybrid go-to-market strategy that includes direct and indirect channels. Our direct sales force leverages their domain expertise in select verticals and over 270 referral relationships with integrated software providers, financial institutions and other partners to identify and attract buyers that would benefit from our AP software solutions and the AvidPay Network. Our indirect channel includes reseller partners and other strategic partnerships such as Mastercard, through MasterCard s B2B Hub, which includes Fifth Third Bank and Bank of America, and other financial institutions, such as KeyBank, and third-party software providers such as MRI Software, RealPage and Sage Software. Our referral and indirect channel partnerships provide us greater reach across the market to access a variety of buyers. 
 Our revenues are recurring in nature and are derived from multiple sources, predominantly through software revenue from our buyers and revenue from payments made to their suppliers. The table below represents our revenues disaggregated by type of service performed (in thousands):

Macroeconomic Environment s Impact on Revenue 
 Despite the resiliency exhibited by aspects of the U.S economy during the first nine months of 2024, we believe that certain of our customers continue to exhibit caution in their purchasing decisions. More broadly, we believe that certain of the verticals or sub-components of those verticals in which we operate have been and continue to be more adversely impacted by the macroeconomic environment, which contrasts with the broader but measured improvement in overall economic sentiment. 
 Tempered spending by prospects and customers impacts us two ways. First, tempered spending and a focus on costs can impact payment volumes, payment amounts, and payment type mix. The business metrics that best reflect this impact include transaction yield and total payment volume. Second, cautious spending impacts sales and is reflected, in part, in our software revenue as well as the number of invoices that we process. The business metric that best reflects this impact can be found in transactions processed. 
 In the short term, while we believe that we will benefit from improving overall economic sentiment in the coming quarters, we also believe that we will be better positioned to gauge inflections in sentiment among our customer verticals after the uncertainties of the current political cycle and broader macroeconomic environment are behind us. 
 As for the changing interest rate environment, when rates were higher during the earlier part of the year, our payment revenue and interest income, resulting from the funds we held for buyers, were positively impacted. Interest income, which is a component of our payment revenue, was negatively impacted when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates earlier this year and will continue to be negatively impacted should the Federal Reserve elect to continue to cut interest rates. Such changes could also lead to difficulty in comparing our current consolidated financial results to our results in future reporting periods. 
 Key Financial and Business Metrics 
 We regularly review several financial and business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics provide meaningful supplemental information for management and investors in assessing our historical and future operating performance. The calculation of the key metrics and other measures discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts or investors.

Transactions processed 
 We believe that transactions processed is an important measure of our business because it is a key indicator of the use by both buyers and suppliers of our solutions and our ability to generate revenue, since a majority of our revenue is generated based on transactions processed. We define transactions processed as the number of invoice transactions and payment transactions, such as invoices, purchase orders, checks, ACH payments and VCCs, processed through our platform during a particular period. 
 Transaction yield 
 We believe that transaction yield is an important measure of the value of our solutions to buyers and suppliers as we scale. We define transaction yield as the total revenue during a particular period divided by the total transactions processed during such period. 
 Total payment volume 
 We believe total payment volume is an important measure of our AvidPay Network business as it quantifies the demand for our payment services. We define total payment volume as the dollar sum of buyers AP payments paid to their suppliers through the AvidPay Network during a particular period. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue from the following sources: (i) software, (ii) payments, and (iii) services. 
 Software Revenue 
 We generate software revenue from our buyers primarily through (i) fees calculated based on the number of invoices and payment transactions processed and (ii) recurring maintenance and SaaS fees. Software revenue is typically billed to and paid by our buyers on a monthly basis. Our software offerings, many of which are built for specific verticals, address the needs of buyers and together they comprise our suite of predominately cloud-based solutions designed to manage invoices and automate the AP function. We generally sign multi-year contracts with buyers and revenue is recognized over the term of the contract. We also 
 20 

generally receive initial upfront implementation fees and software maintenance fees for ongoing support, which are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable support period. 
 Payment Revenue 
 We generate revenue from the payments our buyers make to their suppliers through (i) offering electronic payment solutions to suppliers, (ii) fees charged to suppliers from our invoice payment accelerator product, and (iii) interest on funds held for buyers pending disbursement. 
 Our electronic payment solutions currently include VCC and an enhanced ACH payment product, or AvidPay Direct, which eliminate paper checks and increase the speed of payment to the supplier. AvidPay Direct also provides suppliers with enhanced remittance data allowing the supplier to reconcile the payment and the underlying invoice. VCC revenues result from interchange fees applied to the spend processed and are recorded net of fees and incentives. AvidPay Direct revenue is based on a per transaction fee that we charge to suppliers that generally includes a cap and is based on the spend per payment and is recorded net of incentives. 
 Our invoice payment accelerator product, Payment Accelerator, provides certain suppliers with the opportunity to better manage cash flows and receive payments even faster by allowing suppliers to receive advance payment on qualifying invoices. Revenues are generated on a per transaction basis for each payment that is advanced. We currently fund the accelerated payment of invoices from our balance sheet. 
 Interest income represents interest received from buyer deposits held during the payment clearing process. We receive interest on funds held through our contractual relationship with our buyers, which we recognize as payment revenue. The rate we earn on buyer funds is difficult to predict in the short and long term and will continue to be impacted by the Federal Reserve s monetary policy and any adjustments that are made in response to inflation. Due to the elevated levels of inflation in the U.S. economy, and the resulting increases in interest rates, we experienced an increase in revenues generated on funds held during the payment clearing process during 2022, 2023 and 2024. This level of interest income on buyer deposits may not be sustainable in future years or in nearer term periods depending on the Federal Reserve s future actions. The Federal Reserve is expected by many to reduce interest rates in near to mid-term future periods, which would in turn have a negative impact on our payment revenue although the extent to which rates will be reduced, if at all, and the specific timing of the rate cuts remains highly uncertain. 
 Our media payments business includes customers that are involved in political advertising in the U.S. Revenue from these customers is cyclical as it is connected to U.S. election advertising spend which tends to increase during significant election years, such as mid-term and presidential elections. As 2024 is a presidential election year, we expect an increase in the payments associated with political advertising in connection with the presidential election cycle in 2024, compared to 2023 which was not a significant election year. 
 We utilize service providers to process a substantial portion of our payment revenue that is derived from interchange fees earned on payment transactions processed as VCCs. A large percentage of our revenue is processed by a small number of providers and our revenue is also dependent on the rates we are able to negotiate with these providers. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for disclosures regarding this concentration. 
 Services Revenue 
 Services revenue includes fees charged to process buyer change in service requests. 
 Total Revenue 
 We expect our total revenue to increase year over year due to an increase in the number of transactions processed, and the number of buyers and suppliers using the AvidPay Network, and that payment revenue should comprise a greater proportion of total revenue as the volume of transactions on the AvidPay Network continue to increase. 
 Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues includes personnel related costs, which include direct compensation, fringe benefits, short- and long-term incentive plans and stock-based compensation expense. Cost of revenues includes teams responsible for buyer and supplier onboarding and setup, invoice processing, payment operations, money movement execution, and customer service. Personnel costs also include internal labor associated with the employees who monitor the performance and reliability of our buyer and supplier solutions and the underlying delivery infrastructure (i.e., application and data hosting administration, product support and escalations, payment monitoring and settlement functions). 
 Cost of revenues also includes external expenses that are directly attributed to the processing of invoice and payment transactions. These expenses include the cost of scanning and indexing invoices, printing checks, postage for mailing checks, expenses for processing payments (ACH, check, and wires), bank fees associated with buyer deposits held during the payment 
 21 

clearing process, and other transaction execution costs. Additionally, cost of revenues includes fees paid to third parties for the use of their technology, data hosting services, customer relationship management tools used in the delivery of our services or in support of the delivery infrastructure, and adjustments to the allowance for uncollectible advancements processed through Payment Accelerator. Lastly, cost of revenues includes estimates for treasury losses that occur in treasury operations. Treasury losses include various unrecoverable internal payment processing errors that occur in the ordinary course of business, such as duplicate payments, overpayments, payments to the wrong party and reconciliation errors. 
 We have elected to exclude amortization expense of capitalized developed software and acquired technology, as well as allocations of fixed asset depreciation expense and facility expenses from cost of revenues. 
 We expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue to decrease as we continue to realize operational efficiencies and shift more of our transactions to electronic payments. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing consists primarily of costs related to our direct sales force and partner channels that are incurred in the process of setting up go-to-market strategies, generating leads, building brand awareness and acquiring new buyers and suppliers, including efforts to convert suppliers from paper check payments to electronic forms of payments and efforts to enroll them into the Payment Accelerator solution. 
 Personnel costs include salaries, wages, direct and amortized sales commissions, fringe benefits, short- and long-term incentive plans and stock-based compensation expense. Most of the commissions paid to the direct sales force are incremental based upon invoice and payment volume from the acquisition of a new buyer and are deferred and amortized ratably over an estimated benefit period of five years. 
 The partner ecosystem consists of reseller, referral and accounting system partners. Compensation paid to referral and accounting system partners in exchange for the referral and marketing efforts of the partner is classified as sales and marketing expense. 
 In addition, we focus on generating awareness of our platform and products through a variety of sponsorships, user conferences, trade shows, and integrated marketing campaigns. Costs associated with these efforts, including travel expenses, external consulting services, and various technology applications are included in sales and marketing as well. 
 While we expect to continue to increase marketing activities over the coming periods, we are focused on efficient deployment of these marketing resources, and as a result we expect our sales and marketing expenses to experience modest growth in absolute terms in the near term. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development efforts focus on the development of new products and business intelligence tools or the enhancements of existing products and applications, as well as large scale infrastructure projects that improve the underlying architecture of our technology. 
 The main contributors of research and development costs are (i) personnel related expenses, including fringe benefits, short- and long-term incentive plans and stock-based compensation expense, and (ii) fees for outsourced professional services. We capitalize certain internal and external development costs that are attributable to new products or new functionality of existing products and amortize such costs to depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life, which is generally three years. 
 We also incur research and development costs attributable to the use of software tools and technologies required to facilitate our research and development activities. Examples of such costs include fees paid to third parties to host lower technical environments and the associated virtual machine ware fees paid to support agile development efforts, and fees paid for software tools and licenses used in quality control testing and code deployment activities. 
 We expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term as we are able to efficiently deploy our development resources against a larger revenue base. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of our finance, human resources, legal and compliance, facilities, information technology, administration, and information security organizations. Significant cost contributors are (i) personnel expenses, including fringe benefits, short- and long-term incentive plans and stock-based compensation expense, and (ii) costs of software applications, including end user computing solutions, and various technology tools utilized by these organizations. Occupancy expenses, which include personnel, rent, maintenance and property tax costs are not allocated to other components of the statements of operations and remain in general and administrative expenses. 
 22 

While we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term, we expect our general and administrative expenses may increase from time to time in absolute dollars over the shorter term as we continue to build out our infrastructure to support our operations and implement additional safeguards and cybersecurity enhancements. 
 General and administrative expenses include costs incurred from time to time related to events and transactions not directly attributable to operations. For example, during 2023, general and administrative expenses include costs incurred in connection with a cybersecurity incident as well as insurance recoveries. Additionally, general and administrative expenses also include restructuring costs incurred in connection with planned reductions of our U.S. workforce. Restructuring costs consist of one-time severance charges to be paid to affected employees. 
 Impairment and Write-Off of Intangible Assets 
 Impairment and write-off of intangible assets is the reduction from carrying value to fair value for assets or asset groups whose carrying value is not recoverable and also includes charges determined based on our estimation of the amount of obsolescence of previously capitalized software development costs. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of property and equipment over the estimated useful life of the applicable asset, as well as amortization of acquired intangibles (i.e., technology, customer list and tradename) with a useful life between 3 and 15 years, and amortization of capitalized software development costs with an estimated benefit of 3 years. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense on our bank borrowings and headquarters finance leases, offset by interest income on non-customer corporate funds. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Income tax expense (benefit) consists of federal and state current and deferred income taxes.

Revenues

98,680

14.3 

The increase in revenues was largely comprised of an increase in payment revenue of 12.2 million, or 17.8 , driven primarily by increased electronic payments on the AvidPay Network due to the addition of new and existing buyer payment transaction volume and an increase in payment yield, that resulted, in part, from increased interest rates over the prior year period. Payment revenue and payment yield were positively impacted by interest on funds held for customers as the rate earned on those funds increased during the period compared to rates earned in the prior year period. Payment revenue from interest increased 2.0 million to 12.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 10.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Software revenue increased by 1.7 million, or 6.0 , primarily driven by increased invoice and payment transaction volume from new and existing customers as well as increases in certain subscription-based revenue. The prior year period included an out of period adjustment of a 1.5 million increase to revenue, primarily comprised of an increase in software revenue of 1.1 million and an increase in services revenue of 0.5 million, offset by a decrease in payment revenue of 0.1 million.

The decrease in cost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) was due primarily to decreases in employee costs of 1.6 million due to decreased headcount (explained in Sales and Marketing below) and savings of 0.5 million in consulting and contract labor costs as a result of transitioning to new vendors. These decreases were partially offset by increases in invoice and check processing fees of 0.7 million and increases in IT infrastructure costs of 0.2 million. Additionally, misdirected payments increased 0.3 million and Payments Accelerator reserve increased 0.3 million.

Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by increases in employee costs of 1.7 million and marketing costs of 0.6 million. The increase in employee costs reflects the shift in responsibility of certain teammates to increase utilization and adoption of our software. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in consulting costs of 0.2 million as we discontinued services of certain vendors. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with engaging consultants and contractors of 2.0 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in employee costs of 1.2 million related to a decrease in headcount and lower rate of bonus accrual compared to the prior year period. An additional decrease of 0.7 million was attributable to an increase in amount capitalized for software development costs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a 1.1 million increase in reserve for credit losses compared to the prior year period which also benefited from a reserve release. We experienced additional increases in IT 
 24 

infrastructure costs of 0.8 million related to several enhancement initiatives and 0.3 million related to staffing and consulting services. These increases were offset by a decrease of 0.7 million of net costs incurred in the prior year period in connection with the cybersecurity incident that was detected in April 2023. Additionally, we incurred 1.1 million of costs from the write-off of debt issuance costs from amending and restating our credit facility in the current period that were more than offset by a loss contingency of 1.6 million related to a potential commercial dispute recognized in the prior year period. 
 We do not expect additional recoveries or significant costs related to the cybersecurity incident will be incurred in future periods. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased in absolute terms primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with capitalized software development costs.

Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by increases in employee costs of 1.9 million and marketing expenses of 0.5 million. The primary driver for the increase in employee costs relates to the shift in responsibility of certain teammates to increase utilization and adoption of our software. Additionally, amortization expense of deferred sales commissions increased 0.4 million and partner commissions increased 0.2 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in consulting costs of 0.8 million as we discontinued services of certain vendors and a decrease in travel expense of 0.2 million. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with engaging consultants and contractors of 2.0 million and increases in employee costs of 1.6 million. We experienced additional increases of 0.8 million in IT infrastructure and other costs. These increases were partially offset by decreases of 1.0 million attributable to an increase in the amount capitalized for software development costs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 The decrease in general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to the cybersecurity incident that was detected in April 2023. During the first nine months of 2024 we recorded 0.9 million more recoveries from cybersecurity insurance than the prior year period and we experienced a decrease in costs related to the cybersecurity incident of 5.2 million as the prior year period incurred a significant amount of expense associated with our initial threat response. An additional decrease of 1.6 million is attributable to an accrual made in the prior year period related to a potential commercial dispute. These decreases were partially offset by increases in employee costs of 0.6 million, IT infrastructure costs of 1.9 million, and legal and professional fees of 0.3 million. Additionally, we incurred 1.1 million of costs from the write-off of debt issuance costs from renegotiating our credit facility in the third quarter of 2024 as well as 1.2 million in non-reoccurring restructuring costs during 2024. 
 We do not expect additional recoveries or significant costs related to the cybersecurity incident will be incurred in future periods. 
 Impairment and Write-off of Intangible Assets 
 The impairment and write-off of intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to internally developed software projects. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased in absolute terms primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with capitalized software development costs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Prior to the second quarter of 2024, we did not historically generate positive cash flow through our operations. We have historically financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through sales of common and preferred stock, through borrowings under our credit facilities, as described below, and through our IPO that was completed in October 2021, which resulted in net proceeds of 621.4 million, including the exercise of the overallotment option and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 40.4 million and offering expenses of approximately 11.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity are our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 315.3 million, marketable securities of 79.0 million, and funds available under our revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which we entered into in August 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our unused committed capacity under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was 150.0 million comprised of a revolving commitment. 
 We believe that our unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and funds available under our 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. To the extent existing cash, marketable securities, cash from operations, and amounts available for borrowing under the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are insufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional capital. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or through equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. If we raise additional capital by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional capital by the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Our ability to raise additional debt may be limited by applicable regulatory requirements as a licensed money transmitter that require us to meet certain net worth requirements. Any future indebtedness we incur may result in terms that could be unfavorable to equity investors. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 
 Our primary source of cash provided by our operating activities is from our software and payment revenue. Our primary uses of cash in our operating activities include payments for employee salary and related costs, payments to third party service providers to execute our payment transactions, sales and marketing costs, and other general corporate expenditures. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities improved to 43.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 11.0 million used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in revenue and an improvement from net loss to net income offset by changes in working capital, primarily due to variations in timing of payment of accrued expenses. 
 Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities 
 Cash flows related to our investing activities consist primarily of the maturity and purchases of marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, purchases of intangible assets, capitalization of internal-use software, and supplier advances related to our Payment Accelerator product. 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased to 51.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.2 million provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by differences in the timing of purchases and maturities in our portfolio of held-to-maturity marketable securities. 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 Cash flows related to our financing activities consist primarily of changes in restricted buyer fund deposits related to buyer payment transactions, exercise of stock options, principal payments on financing leases, borrowings and repayments of long-term debt, and share repurchases. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 507.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 57.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to variations in the inflows and outflows from payment service obligations of our customers as well as repayment of debt and share repurchases.

Credit Facilities 
 On August 8, 2024, we entered into an agreement to amend and restate our previous credit facility. As a result, we repaid the outstanding amount of the term loan and expanded the borrowing capacity of the revolving line of credit. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate available borrowing capacity under this agreement was 150.0 million, which may be increased, subject to specific conditions, by an additional amount (for all such increases) not to exceed 150.0 million, for a total aggregate amount of 300.0 million. 
 We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 9 of our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details about our credit facilities. 
 Land Promissory Notes 
 We have promissory notes in connection with land and improvements adjacent to our Charlotte, North Carolina headquarters campus. Refer to Note 9 of our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on our promissory notes. 
 Issuances of Common Stock 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued shares of common stock under our existing stock plans. Refer to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details. 
 Share Repurchases 
 In August 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 3,104,312 shares 
 28 

of common stock for 25.1 million. Refer to Note 10 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details. 
 Payment Obligations 
 We process payments for our customers. As part of our payment product offering, we have recorded payment service obligations in our consolidated balance sheets of 1,154.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and an offsetting asset of restricted funds held for customers. This balance is short-term in nature and represents our obligation to pay our customers' suppliers as directed by our customers. 
 We historically transmitted buyer customer funds using a legacy model pursuant to which buyer customer funds were held in trust accounts that were maintained and operated by a trustee pending distribution to suppliers in accordance with instructions provided through our platform. After buyers funds were deposited in a trust account, we initiated payment through external payment networks whereby the buyers funds were distributed from the trust to the appropriate supplier. We are not the trustee or beneficiary of the trusts which hold these buyer deposits; accordingly, we do not record these assets and offsetting liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We have largely transitioned away from the trust model although certain banks that resell our products and services continue to leverage a similar structure. We contractually earn interest on funds held for certain buyers. The amount of Company and bank customer funds held in all trust-related and similar accounts was approximately 21.9 million and 6.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There were no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the contractual obligations and commitments disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 8 of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding contractual obligations and commitments. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as compared to the critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of September 30, 2024. 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of (i) our operating cash and (ii) buyer funds. Our operating cash includes cash received from revenues generated, the sale of common and preferred stock and increased borrowings. Buyer funds are funds that have been collected from buyers, but not yet remitted to the applicable supplier. The funds are held in either company-owned accounts, which are subject to applicable state money transmitter laws, or in trust-related accounts. We are generally entitled to retain any interest earned on the investment of buyer funds as specified by our contractual arrangements with our buyers. 
 Our operating cash may be invested in accordance with our cash investment policy. Under that policy, we invest with the objective of preserving capital while optimizing yield. Permissible investments include U.S. Treasury instruments, U.S. Government Agency securities, Government-Sponsored Enterprise securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and money market funds. As of September 30, 2024, we held marketable securities with an amortized cost basis of 79.0 million and money market funds with an aggregate value of 60.5 million. The remaining amount of operating cash was held in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts. 
 Our buyer funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with these objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income with emphasis on 
 29 

liquidity. Pursuant to our investment policy and subject to applicable law, buyer funds may be invested in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government Agency securities, or other cash equivalents, including certificates of deposit and time deposits. As of September 30, 2024, all buyer funds have been invested in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts. 
 We are exposed to interest-rate risk relating to our investment portfolio, which consists principally of interest-bearing demand deposit accounts as well as investments made in accordance with our cash investment policy. We recognize interest earned from buyer funds assets as revenue. We generally do not pay interest to buyers. Factors that influence the rate of interest we earn include the short-term market interest rate environment and the weighting of balances by security type. The annualized interest rate earned on our investment of operating cash and funds held for buyers increased to 5.04 during the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 from 4.39 during fiscal year 2023. Based on current investment practices, an increase in the interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed our interest income in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 from our investment of operating cash by approximately 2.9 million and our interest on buyer funds assets by approximately 8.1 million based upon the average balances for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 of 452.6 million in operating cash investments and 1,006.8 million in buyer funds investments, respectively. In addition to interest rate risks, we also have exposure to risks associated with changes in laws and regulations that may affect buyer fund balances. For example, a change in regulations that restricts the permissible investment alternatives for buyer funds may reduce our interest earned revenue. 
 We are also exposed to interest-rate risk relating to existing variable rate bank borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings on variable rate debt of 0 and 63.4 million, respectively. A 100 basis points increase in the variable rate would have resulted in incremental interest expense of 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our interest-rate risk will continue to be impacted by the Federal Reserve s monetary policy and response to the higher than normal level of inflation in the U.S. economy. 
 Credit Risk 
 We may be exposed to credit risk in connection with our investments, as our cash on deposit, including buyer funds, regularly exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Company FDIC limits. We limit credit risk by diversifying our portfolio, including a requirement that no more than 5 of invested funds may be held in the issues of a single corporation. Additionally, absent certain limited exceptions, the minimum credit quality of any fixed income investment shall be not less than an (A-) or (A3) rating equivalent from any single rating services based on ratings by any of Standard and Poor s Ratings Services, Moody s Investors Service, or Fitch Investor Services. The maximum maturity of any security in the portfolio shall not exceed 24 months. The weighted average maturity of the portfolio shall not exceed 36 months. In addition, maximum maturities of individual securities are further limited by the security type and cash segment of the investment. We are also exposed to credit risk related to the timing of payments made from buyer funds collected. We typically remit buyer funds to our buyers suppliers in advance of having good or confirmed funds collected from our buyers. Our buyers generally have three days to dispute transactions and if we remit funds in advance of receiving confirmation that no dispute was initiated by our buyer, then we could suffer a credit loss. We mitigate this credit exposure by leveraging our data assets to make credit underwriting decisions about whether to accelerate disbursements, managing exposure limits, and various controls in our operating systems. 
 There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC or other comparable insurance limits will be backstopped by the U.S. government, or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis. While we do not currently maintain private insurance to mitigate this risk, we seek to mitigate this risk by monitoring financial institutions that we conduct business with and endeavoring to maintain our cash balances at large well-capitalized financial institutions. 
 We are also exposed to risks associated with our Payment Accelerator product, in which our supplier customers can accelerate the receipt of payment for outstanding invoices before our buyers initiate the transfer of funds. If those invoices are not approved or the buyer does not transfer the requisite funds then we are exposed to the risk of not being able to recoup our advances to the supplier. We mitigate this risk through data analytics to determine which invoices are available and appropriate for advance payment. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 As part of our buyer funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our buyers to satisfy other unrelated buyer funds obligations. We minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a buyer available at the time the buyer s obligation becomes due by collecting the buyer s funds in advance of the timing of payment of the buyer s obligation. As a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of buyer funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations. 
 Concentration Risk 
 A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from interchange fees earned on payment transactions processed from VCC service providers. Prior to 2022, our interchange fees were processed primarily through a single provider. To mitigate this 
 30 

concentration risk, we have expanded the number of processor suppliers. Revenue from two of these suppliers was greater than 10 of our total revenue, individually. Refer to Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding this concentration. 
 Future regulation or changes by the payment networks could have a substantial impact on our revenue from VCC transactions. If interchange rates decline, whether due to actions by the payment networks, merchant/suppliers availing themselves of lower rates, or future regulation, our total operating revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business could be materially affected. 
 We are also exposed to concentration risk associated with buyer funds that we hold in Company-owned accounts, which are subject to applicable state money transmitter laws, and in trust accounts. As of September 30, 2024, all buyer funds have been invested in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts. The majority of these demand accounts are maintained at one institution which is a full-service, FDIC-insured national bank supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and is a subsidiary of a bank holding company subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. As indicated above, while we do not currently maintain private insurance to mitigate this risk, we seek to mitigate this risk by monitoring financial institutions that we conduct business with and endeavoring to maintain our cash balances at large well-capitalized financial institutions. 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of September 30, 2024, to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed and filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified, and that management will be timely alerted to material information required to be included in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 It em 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we have been and will continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 (a) Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 None. 
 31 

(b) Use of Proceeds 
 Use of Proceeds 
 On October 15, 2021, we completed our IPO. All shares sold were registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-259632), declared effective by the SEC on October 12, 2021. 
 There have been no material changes in the planned use of proceeds from the IPO from those described in our Final Prospectus. We have invested a portion of the funds received in short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade securities. 
 (b) Purchases of Equity Securities by the Company 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Company 
 In August 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million of our outstanding shares of common stock (the "Share Repurchased Program"). Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. The timing, price, and volume of the repurchases will be executed based on various market and legal factors, and subject to a 50 million cap in any fiscal year pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The share repurchase program will terminate upon the earlier of December 31, 2025 or the date on which the maximum dollar amount has been expended, but is subject to suspension, modification, or termination at any time at the Company's discretion. 
 The following table provides shares repurchase activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024:
