EXPLANATORY NOTE 

Background and Effect of the Restatement 

As previously disclosed in the Registrant s Current Reports on Form 8-K
 dated November 18, 2024, management of the Registrant Management ), concluded that the financial statements of the Registrant in the following reports should no longer be relied upon: 

the previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023; 

the previously filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
 for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024; and 

the previously filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
 for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024. 

The determinations made by Management resulted from the following errors in the relevant prior financial statements identified by the Registrant during preparation of its financial statements as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024: 

In the Statements of Financial Condition, an understatement of Segregated cash balances with brokers for futures contracts and overstatement or understatement of Receivable (Payable) on open futures contracts . 

In the Statements of Cash Flows, incorrect balances within the Decrease (Increase) in receivable/payable on open futures contracts , Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities , Cash, beginning of period and Cash, end of period . 

Management determined that the misclassifications described above did not have any impact on the Registrant s performance, investment results, net asset values, income and distributions. These errors were classification errors related to Futures Commission Merchant accounts of one broker and there is no impact on the net futures exposure to the Registrant. 

This Amendment reflects the correction of the classification errors described above, which were identified subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 

 Restatement of Other Financial Statements 

In addition to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A,
 the Registrant is concurrently filing amendments to its Annual Report on Form 10-K/A
 for the year ended December 31, 2023, (the Form 10-K/A and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A
 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, (the Form10-Q/A ).
 The Registrant is filing the Form 10-K/A
 and the Form 10-Q/A
 to restate its financial statements and related financial information for the periods contained in those reports in relation to the errors described above. 

 Internal Control Considerations 

As a result of the errors described above and the restatement of the Original Form 10-Q, the Registrant s management has 
 re-evaluated
 
the effectiveness of the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. Management has concluded that the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures with respect to controls related to the classification of the account balances with futures commission merchants FCMs described above were not effective as of June 30, 2024, and its internal control over financial reporting with respect to such account balances was not effective as of June 30, 2024, due to the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting with respect to such account balances. Specifically, there was a material weakness in the design of a control activity with respect to the presentation of the FCM accounts indicated above within the Statements of Financial Condition and Statements of Cash Flows. See additional discussion included in Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 series of the Trust have commenced investment operations: (i) ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares VIX Mid-Term
 Futures ETF (each, a Matching VIX Fund and collectively, the Matching VIX Funds (ii) ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (each, a Geared VIX Fund and collectively, the Geared VIX Funds and (iii) ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares UltraShort Gold, ProShares UltraShort Silver, ProShares UltraShort Euro, ProShares UltraShort Yen, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares Ultra Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares Ultra Euro and ProShares Ultra Yen (each, a Leveraged Fund and collectively, the Leveraged Funds Each of the Funds listed above issues common units of beneficial interest Shares ), which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of only that Fund. The Shares of each Fund, other than the Matching VIX Funds and the Geared VIX Funds, are listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. NYSE Arca ). The Matching VIX Funds and the Geared VIX Funds are listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange Cboe BZX ). The Leveraged Funds and the Geared VIX Funds, are collectively referred to as the Geared Funds in these Notes to Financial Statements. The Geared VIX Funds and the Matching VIX Funds are collectively referred to as the VIX Funds in these Notes to Financial Statements.
 The Trust had no operations prior to November 24, 2008, other than matters relating to its organization, the registration of each series under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the sale and issuance to ProShare Capital Management LLC (the Sponsor of Shares at an aggregate purchase price of in each of the following Funds: ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares UltraShort Gold, ProShares UltraShort Silver, ProShares UltraShort Euro, ProShares UltraShort Yen, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares Ultra Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares Ultra Euro and ProShares Ultra Yen. 
 Groups of Funds are collectively referred to in several different ways. References to Short Funds, UltraShort Funds, or Ultra Funds refer to the different Funds based upon their investment objectives, but without distinguishing among the Funds benchmarks. References to Commodity Index Funds, Commodity Funds and Currency Funds refer to the different Funds according to their general benchmark categories without distinguishing among the Funds investment objectives or Fund-specific benchmarks. References to VIX Funds refer to the different Funds based upon their investment objective and their general benchmark categories. 
 The Short Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to one-half
 the inverse (-0.5x)
 of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each UltraShort Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x)
 of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Ultra Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to either one and one-half
 times (1.5x) or two times (2x) the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Matching VIX Fund seeks investment results, before fees and expenses, both for a single day
 and over time, that match (1x) the performance of its corresponding benchmark. Daily performance is measured from the calculation of each Fund s net asset value NAV to the Fund s next NAV calculation. 
 The Geared Funds do not seek to achieve their stated investment objectives over a period of time greater than a single day because mathematical compounding prevents the Geared Funds from achieving such results. Accordingly, results over periods of time greater than a single day should not be expected to be a simple multiple (e.g., -0.5x,
 -2x,
 1.5x, or 2x) of the period return of the corresponding benchmark and will likely differ significantly. 
 Share Splits and Reverse Share Splits 

ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures 

ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas 

ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures 

ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas 

ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures 

The reverse splits were applied retroactively for all periods presented, reducing the number of Shares outstanding for each of the Funds, and resulted in a proportionate increase in the price per Share and per Share information of each such Fund. Therefore, the reverse splits did not change the aggregate net asset value of a shareholder s investment at the time of the reverse split.

per annum of its average daily NAV of such Fund. Each Matching VIX Fund pays the Sponsor a Management Fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to per annum of its average daily NAV of such Fund. Each Fund accrues the Management Fee daily at an annualized rate based on its average daily net assets. 
 The Management Fee is paid in consideration of the Sponsor s trading advisory services and the other services provided to the Fund that the Sponsor pays directly. From the Management Fee, the Sponsor pays all of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of each Fund, generally as determined by the Sponsor, including but not limited to, (i) the fees and expenses of the Administrator, Custodian, Transfer Agent, Distributor (as each is defined below), and ProFunds Distributors, Inc., an affiliated broker-dealer of the Sponsor, as well as accounting and auditing fees and expenses, (ii) any Index licensors for the Funds; and (iii) the normal and expected expenses incurred in connection with the continuous offering of Shares of each Fund after the commencement of its trading operations. Fees associated with a Fund s trading operations may include expenses such as tax preparation expenses, legal fees not in excess of per annum, ongoing SEC registration fees not exceeding per annum of the NAV of a Fund and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA filing fees, individual Schedule K-1
 preparation and mailing fees not exceeding per annum of the net assets of a Fund, and report preparation and mailing expenses. 
 Non-Recurring
 Fees and Expenses 

 Each Fund pays all of its non-recurring
 and unusual fees and expenses, if any, as determined by the Sponsor. Non-recurring
 and unusual fees and expenses are fees and expenses that are unexpected or unusual in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities, litigation costs or indemnification or other material expenses which are not currently anticipated obligations of the Funds. 
 The Administrator 

 BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon BNY Mellon ), serves as the Administrator of the Funds (the Administrator ). The Trust, on its own behalf and on behalf of each Fund, and BNY Mellon have entered into an administration and accounting agreement (the Administration and Accounting Agreement in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of the Administration and Accounting Agreement and under the supervision and direction of the Sponsor and the Trust, BNY Mellon prepares and files certain regulatory filings on behalf of the Funds. BNY Mellon may also perform other services for the Funds pursuant to the Administration and Accounting Agreement as mutually agreed upon by the Sponsor, the Trust and BNY Mellon from time to time. The Administrator s fees are paid on behalf of the Funds by the Sponsor. 
 The Custodian 

 BNY Mellon serves as the Custodian of the Funds (the Custodian ). The Trust, on its own behalf and on behalf of each Fund, and BNY Mellon have entered into a custody agreement (the Custody Agreement in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of the Custody Agreement, BNY Mellon is responsible for the holding and safekeeping of assets delivered to it by the Funds, and performing various administrative duties in accordance with instructions delivered to BNY Mellon by the Funds. The Custodian s fees are paid on behalf of the Funds by the Sponsor. 

Shares of a Geared Fund and Shares of a Matching VIX Fund. Creation Units may be created or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. As a result of the reverse share splits as described in Note 1 and Note 8, certain redemptions as disclosed in the Statements of Changes in Shareholders Equity reflect payment of fractional share balances on beneficial shareholder accounts. 
 Except when aggregated in Creation Units, the Shares are not redeemable securities. Retail investors, therefore, generally will not be able to purchase or redeem Shares directly from or with a Fund. Rather, most retail investors will purchase or sell Shares in the secondary market with the assistance of a broker. Thus, some of the information contained in these Notes to Financial Statements such as references to the Transaction Fees imposed on purchases and redemptions is not relevant to retail investors. 
 Transaction Fees on Creation and Redemption Transactions 

 The manner by which Creation Units are purchased or redeemed is governed by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement and Authorized Participant Procedures Handbook. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to: (1) deposit cash with the Custodian; and (2) if permitted by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for an exchange of futures contract for related position or block trade with the relevant fund whereby the Authorized Participant would also transfer to such Fund a number and type of exchange-traded futures contracts at or near the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date. 
 Authorized Participants may pay a fixed transaction fee (typically in connection with each order to create or redeem a Creation Unit in order to compensate BNY Mellon, as the Administrator, the Custodian and the Transfer Agent of each Fund and its Shares, for services in processing the creation and redemption of Creation Units and to offset the costs of increasing or decreasing derivative positions. Authorized Participants also may pay a variable transaction fee to the Fund of up to (and a variable transaction fee to the Matching VIX Funds of of the value of the Creation Unit that is purchased or redeemed unless the transaction fee is waived or otherwise adjusted by the Sponsor. The Sponsor provides such Authorized Participant with prompt notice in advance of any such waiver or adjustment of the transaction fee. Authorized Participants may sell the Shares included in the Creation Units they purchase from the Funds to other investors in the secondary market.

 This difference may be significant. Compounding is the cumulative effect of applying investment gains and losses and income to the principal amount invested over time. Gains or losses experienced over a given period will increase or reduce the principal amount invested from which the subsequent period s returns are calculated. The effects of compounding will likely cause the performance of a Geared Fund to differ from the Geared Fund s stated multiple times the return of its benchmark for the same period. The effect of compounding becomes more pronounced as benchmark volatility and holding period increase. The impact of compounding will impact each shareholder differently depending on the period of time an investment in a Geared Fund is held and the volatility of the benchmark during the holding period of an investment in the Geared Fund. 
 The return of a Geared Fund for periods longer than a day is the product of a series of daily leveraged returns for each trading day during that period. If you hold Geared Fund shares for any period other than a day, it is important for you to understand the risks and long-term performance of a daily objective fund. You should know that over your holding period: 

Your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target, and this difference may be significant. 

Factors that contribute to returns that are worse than the Daily Target include smaller Benchmark gains or losses and higher Benchmark volatility, as well as longer holding periods when these factors apply. 

Factors that contribute to returns that are better than the Daily Target include larger Benchmark gains or losses and lower Benchmark volatility, as well as longer holding periods when these factors apply. 

The more extreme these factors are, and the more they occur together, the more your return will tend to deviate from the Daily Target. 
 For periods longer than a day, you will lose money if the Benchmark s performance is flat. It is possible that you will lose money invested in a Short or UltraShort Fund even if the value of the Benchmark falls during that period or money invested in an Ultra Fund even if the value of the Benchmark rises during that period. Returns may move in the opposite direction of the Benchmark during periods of higher Benchmark volatility, low Benchmark returns, or both. In addition, during periods of higher Benchmark volatility, the Benchmark volatility may affect your return as much or more than the return of the Benchmark. 
 Each Ultra and UltraShort Fund uses leverage and should produce daily returns that are more volatile than that of its benchmark. For example, the daily return of an Ultra with a 1.5x or 2x multiple should be approximately one and one-half
 or two times as volatile on a daily basis as is the return of a fund with an objective of matching the same benchmark. The daily return of an UltraShort Fund is designed to return two times the inverse (-2x)
 of the return that would be expected of a fund with an objective of matching the same benchmark. The Geared Funds are not appropriate for all investors and present significant risks not applicable to other types of funds. The Leveraged Funds use leverage and are riskier than similarly benchmarked exchange-traded funds that do not use leverage. An investor should only consider an investment in a Geared Fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily leveraged, daily inverse or daily inverse leveraged investment results. Investors should understand the consequences of holding daily rebalanced funds for periods longer than a given day, including the impact of compounding on fund performance. Shareholders who invest in the Geared Funds should consider actively monitoring and/or periodically rebalancing their investments (which will possibly trigger transaction costs and tax consequences) in light of their investment goals and risk tolerances. 
 The Matching VIX Funds seek to achieve their stated investment objective over time. 

at any point in the day could result in the total loss or almost total loss of an investor s investment if that movement is contrary to the investment objective of the Fund in which an investor has invested, even if such Fund s benchmark subsequently moves in an opposite direction, eliminating all or a portion of the movement. This would be the case with downward single-day
 or intraday movements in the underlying benchmark of an Ultra Fund or upward single-day
 or intraday movements in the benchmark of an UltraShort Fund, even if the underlying benchmark maintains a level greater than zero at all times. 
 Liquidity Risk 

 Financial Instruments cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption can also make it difficult to liquidate a position or find a swap or forward contract counterparty at a reasonable cost. Market illiquidity may cause losses for the Funds. The large size of the positions which the Funds may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity by both making their positions more difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so. Any type of disruption or illiquidity will potentially be exacerbated due to the fact that the Funds will typically invest in Financial Instruments related to one benchmark, which in many cases is highly concentrated. 
 Contango and Backwardation Risk 

 In Funds that hold futures contracts, as the futures contracts near expiration, they are generally replaced by contracts that have a later expiration. Thus, for example, a contract purchased and held in November 2022 may specify a January 2023 expiration. As that contract nears expiration, it may be replaced by selling the January 2023 contract and purchasing the contract expiring in March 2023. This process is referred to as rolling. Rolling may have a positive or negative impact on performance. For example, historically, the prices of certain types of futures contracts have frequently been higher for contracts with shorter-term expirations than for contracts with longer-term expirations, which is referred to as backwardation. In these circumstances, absent other factors, the sale of the January 2023 contract would take place at a price that is higher than the price at which the March 2023 contract is purchased, thereby creating a gain in connection with rolling. While certain types of futures contracts have historically exhibited consistent periods of backwardation, backwardation will likely not exist in these markets at all times. The presence of contango (where prices of contracts are higher in the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months due to the costs of long-term storage of a physical commodity prior to delivery or other factors) in certain futures contracts at the time of rolling would be expected to adversely affect an Ultra Fund or a Matching VIX Fund that invests in such futures, and positively affect a Short Fund or an UltraShort Fund that invests in such futures. Similarly, the presence of backwardation in certain futures contracts at the time of rolling such contracts would be expected to adversely affect the Short Fund and UltraShort Funds, and positively affect the Ultra Funds and Matching VIX Funds. 
 Since the introduction of VIX futures contracts, there have frequently been periods where VIX futures prices reflect higher expected volatility levels further out in time. This can result in a loss from rolling the VIX futures to maintain the constant weighted average maturity of the applicable VIX Futures Index. Losses from exchanging a lower priced VIX future for a higher priced longer-term future in the rolling process would adversely affect the value of each VIX Futures Index and, accordingly, decrease the return of the Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and the Matching VIX Funds. 
 Gold and silver have historically exhibited persistent contango markets rather than backwardation. Natural gas, like crude oil, moves in and out of backwardation and contango but historically has been in contango most commonly. 
 There have been times where WTI crude oil futures contracts experience extraordinary contango or extraordinary backwardation . For example, in April 2020, the market for crude oil futures contracts experienced a period of extraordinary contango that resulted in a negative price in the May 2020 WTI crude oil futures contract. In the summer of 2022, the market for crude oil futures contracts experienced a period of extreme backwardation, but normalized towards the end of the year. The futures contracts held by the Funds may experience a period of extraordinary contango or backwardation in the future. If all or a significant portion of the futures contracts held by 

and a . The splits were effective prior to market open on November 7, 2024, when the funds began trading at its post-split price. The splits were applied retroactively for all periods presented, reducing (increasing) the number of shares outstanding and resulted in a proportionate increase (decrease) in the price per share and the per share information of the fund. Therefore, the splits did not change the aggregate net asset value of a shareholder s investment at the time of the splits. 

For ZSL, VIXY, BOIL shareholders who hold a quantity of shares that is not an exact multiple of the Reverse Split ratio (i.e., not a multiple of 4 or 5), the Reverse Split will result in the creation of a fractional share. Post-Reverse Split fractional shares will be redeemed for cash and sent to the shareholder s broker of record. This redemption may cause some shareholders to realize gains or losses, which could be a taxable event for those shareholders.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

This information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
 The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as will, may, should, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, intend, project, seek or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risk and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Funds control. The Funds forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions and important factors, risks and uncertainties \in the markets for financial instruments that the Funds trade, in the markets for related physical commodities, in the legal and regulatory regimes applicable to the Sponsor, the Funds, and the Funds service providers, and in the broader economy may cause the Funds actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to the Sponsor and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, both known, such as those described in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K

Introduction 

Each of the Funds generally invests in instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, rate or index (Collectively, Financial Instruments ), including futures contracts, swap agreements, forward contracts and other instruments as a substitute for investing directly in commodities, currencies, or spot volatility products in order to gain exposure to its applicable underlying commodity futures index, commodity, currency exchange rate or equity volatility index. Financial Instruments also are used to produce economically inverse, inverse leveraged or leveraged investment results for the Geared Funds.

 The Short Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to one-half
 the inverse (-0.5x)
 of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each UltraShort Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x)
 of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Ultra Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to either one and one-half
 times (1.5x) or two times (2x) the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Matching VIX Fund seeks investment results, before fees and expenses, both for a single day and over time, that match (1x) the performance of its corresponding benchmark. Daily performance is measured from the calculation of each Fund s net asset value NAV to the Fund s next NAV calculation. 
 Each Geared Fund seeks investment results for a single day only, not for any other period. This is different from most exchange-traded funds and means that the return of such Fund for a period longer than a single trading day will be the result of each day s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ in amount and possibly even direction from -0.5x,
 -2x,
 1.5x, or 2x, of the return of the benchmark to which such Fund is benchmarked for that period. Volatility of the benchmark may be at least as important to a Geared Fund s return for the period as the return of the benchmark. Geared Funds that use leverage, are riskier than similarly benchmarked exchange-traded funds that do not use leverage. Accordingly, these Funds may not be suitable for all investors and should be used only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged, inverse or inverse leveraged investment results. Shareholders who invest in the Geared Funds should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily.

 Each Matching VIX Fund seeks investment results, before fees and expenses, that match the performance of the S P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index (the Short-Term VIX Index or the S P 500 VIX Mid-Term
 Futures Index (the Mid-Term
 VIX Index (each a VIX Futures Index ). Each Geared VIX Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to a multiple or the inverse of the daily performance of the Short-Term VIX Index. Each VIX Fund intends to obtain exposure to its benchmark by taking positions in futures contracts VIX futures contracts based on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Cboe Volatility Index (the VIX ). 
 ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil, ProShares Ultra Gold, ProShares Ultra Silver, ProShares UltraShort Gold, ProShares UltraShort Silver, ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Natural Gas, ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil, and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas are benchmarked to indexes designed to track the performance of commodity futures contracts, as applicable. The daily performance of these Indexes and the corresponding Funds will likely be very different in amount and possibly even direction from the daily performance of the price of the related physical commodities. 

 Each Geared Fund continuously offers and redeems its Shares in blocks of 50,000 Shares and each Matching VIX Fund continuously offers and redeems its Shares in blocks of 25,000 Shares (each such block a Creation Unit ). Only Authorized Participants may purchase and redeem Shares from a Fund and then only in Creation Units. An Authorized Participant is an entity that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with one or more of the Funds. Shares of the Funds are offered to Authorized Participants in Creation Units at each Fund s respective NAV. Authorized Participants may then offer to the public, from time to time, Shares from any Creation Unit they create at a per-Share
 market price that varies depending on, among other factors, the trading price of the Shares of each Fund on its applicable listing exchange, the NAV and the supply of and demand for the Shares at the time of the offer. Shares from the same Creation Unit may be offered at different times and may have different offering prices based upon the above factors. The form of Authorized Participant Agreement and related Authorized Participant Handbook set forth the terms and conditions under which an Authorized Participant may purchase or redeem a Creation Unit. Authorized Participants do not receive from any Fund, the Sponsor, or any of their affiliates, any underwriting fees or compensation in connection with their sale of Shares to the public.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources

In order to collateralize derivatives positions in indices, commodities or currencies, a portion of the NAV of each Fund is held in cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, or other high credit quality short term fixed-income or similar securities (such as shares of money market funds, bank deposits, bank money market accounts, certain variable rate-demand notes and repurchase agreements collateralized by government securities, whether denominated in U.S. dollars or the applicable foreign currency with respect to a Currency Fund). A portion of these investments may be posted as collateral in connection with swap agreements, futures, and/or forward contracts. The percentage that U.S. Treasury bills and other short-term fixed-income securities bear to the shareholders equity of each Fund varies from period to period as the market values of the underlying swaps, futures contracts and forward contracts change. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, each of the Funds earned interest income as follows:

 Each Fund s underlying swaps, futures, options, forward contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, as applicable, may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, swaps and forward contracts are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and in general are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty. In the case of futures contracts, commodity exchanges may limit fluctuations in certain futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits. During a single day, no futures trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in such futures contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Such market conditions could prevent a Fund from promptly liquidating its futures positions. 

 Entry into swap agreements or forward contracts may further impact liquidity because these contractual agreements are executed off-exchange 
 between private parties and, therefore, the time required to offset or unwind these positions may be greater than that for exchange-traded instruments. This potential delay could be exacerbated to the extent a counterparty is not a United States person. 
 The large size of the positions in which a Fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity by both making their positions more difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so. Any type of disruption or illiquidity will potentially be exacerbated due to the fact that the Funds will typically invest in Financial Investments related to one benchmark, which in many cases is highly concentrated. 

 Because each Fund may enter into swaps and may trade futures and forward contracts, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) or the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk).

 Market Risk 

Trading in derivatives contracts involves each Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a commodity, currency or spot volatility product underlying such Fund s benchmark at a specified date and price, should it hold such derivative contract into the deliverable period. Should a Fund enter into a contractual commitment to sell a physical commodity, currency or spot volatility product, it would be required to make delivery of that commodity, currency or spot volatility product at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash. Since the repurchase price to which the value of a commodity, currency or spot volatility product can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell commodities, currencies or spot volatility products would expose a Fund to theoretically unlimited risk. 

 For more information, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
 
 Credit Risk 

When a Fund enters into swap agreements, futures contracts or forward contracts, the Fund is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. 

 The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and most foreign futures exchanges as well as certain swaps is the clearing house associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges, which may become applicable in the future), it may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. 

 Certain swap and forward agreements are contracted for directly with counterparties. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearing house will meet its obligations to a Fund. 

 Swap agreements do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets either at the outset of a transaction or upon settlement. Accordingly, if the counterparty to an OTC swap agreement defaults, the Fund s risk of loss typically consists of the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually entitled to receive, if any. Swap counterparty risk is generally limited to the amount of any unrealized gains, although in the event of a counterparty bankruptcy, there could be delays and costs associated with the recovery of collateral posted in segregated tri-party
 accounts at the Fund s custodian bank. 
 Forward agreements do not involve the delivery of assets at the onset of a transaction, but may be settled physically in the underlying asset if such contracts are held to expiration, particularly in the case of currency forwards. Thus, prior to settlement, if the counterparty to a forward contract defaults, a Fund s risk of loss will generally consist of the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually entitled to receive, if any. However, if physically settled forwards are held until expiration (presently, there is no plan to do this), at the time of settlement, a Fund may be at risk for the full notional value of the forward contracts depending on the type of settlement procedures used. 

 The Sponsor attempts to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally: 

executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties, as determined by the Sponsor; 

limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties to the Funds; 

not posting margin directly with a counterparty; 

requiring that the counterparty posts collateral in amounts approximately equal to that owed to the Funds, as marked to market daily, subject to certain minimum thresholds; 

limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at a FCM; and 

ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of the underlying asset could be called for. 

Off-Balance
 Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

 As of August 2, 2024, the Funds have not used, nor do they expect to use in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance
 sheet financing arrangements and have no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance
 sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of the Funds. While each Fund s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on a Fund s financial position. 
 Management fee payments made to the Sponsor are calculated as a fixed percentage of each Fund s NAV. As such, the Sponsor cannot anticipate the payment amounts that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as NAVs are not known until a future date. The agreement with the Sponsor may be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice to the other party.

 Critical Accounting Policies 

Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The Trust s and the Funds application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. 

 Each Fund has significant exposure to Financial Instruments. The Funds hold a significant portion of their assets in swaps, futures, forward contracts or foreign currency forward contracts, all of which are recorded on a trade date basis and at fair value in the financial statements, with changes in fair value reported in the Statements of Operations. 

 The use of fair value to measure Financial Instruments, with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period, is fundamental to the Trust s and the Funds financial statements. The fair value of a Financial Instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). 

 For financial reporting purposes, the Funds value investments based upon the closing price in their primary markets. Accordingly, the investment valuations in these financial statements may differ from those used in the calculation of certain Funds final creation/redemption NAV for the period ended June 30, 2024. 

 Short-term investments are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value for daily NAV purposes. For financial reporting purposes, short-term investments are valued at their market price using information provided by a third-party pricing service or market quotations. 

 Repurchase agreements are generally valued at amortized cost, provided such amounts approximate fair value. 

 Derivatives (e.g., futures contracts, options, swap agreements, forward agreements and foreign currency forward contracts) are generally valued using independent sources and/or agreements with counterparties or other procedures as determined by the Sponsor. Futures contracts, except for those entered into by the Gold and Silver Funds, are generally valued at the last settled price on the applicable exchange on which that future trades. Futures contracts entered into by the Gold and Silver Funds are valued at the last sales price prior to the time at which the NAV per Share of a Fund is determined. For financial reporting purposes, all futures contracts are valued at last settled price. The Sponsor may in its sole discretion choose to determine a fair value price as the basis for determining the market value of such position. Such fair value prices would be generally determined based on available inputs about the current value of the underlying financial instrument or commodity and would be based on principles that the Sponsor deems fair and equitable so long as such principles are consistent with normal industry standards. The Sponsor may fair value an asset of a Fund pursuant to the policies the Sponsor has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards. 

 Fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of an investment. While each Fund s policy is intended to result in a calculation of the Fund s NAV that fairly reflects investment values as of the time of pricing, the Funds cannot ensure that fair values determined by the Sponsor or persons acting at their direction would accurately reflect the price that the Fund could obtain for an investment if it were to dispose of that investment as of the time of pricing (for instance, in a forced or distressed sale). 

 The prices used by a Fund may differ from the value that would be realized if the investments were sold and the differences could be material to the financial statements. 

 Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis and includes, where applicable, the amortization of premium or discount, and is reflected as Interest Income in the Statement of Operations. Additionally, interest income may be earned on Repurchase Agreements and/or cash held on deposit with brokers for futures contracts. 

 Realized gains (losses) and changes in unrealized gain (loss) on open investments are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively. 

 Each Fund pays its respective brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, NFA fees, give up fees, pit futures account fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities for each Fund s investment in U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulated investments. Brokerage commissions on futures contracts are recognized on a half-turn basis. The Sponsor is currently paying brokerage commissions in VIX futures contracts for the Matching VIX Funds that exceed variable create/redeem fees collected by more than 0.02 of the Matching VIX Fund s average net assets annually.

 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the decrease in the Fund s NAV resulted primarily from a decrease from 5,568,614 outstanding Shares at March 31, 2024 to 4,868,614 outstanding Shares at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the Fund s NAV was offset by the cumulative effect of the Fund seeking daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to one-half
 the inverse (-0.5x)
 of the daily performance of the S P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. By comparison, during the three months ended June 30, 2023, the decrease in the Fund s NAV resulted primarily from a decrease from 9,268,614 outstanding Shares at March 31, 2023 to 6,668,614 outstanding Shares at June 30, 2023. The decrease in the Fund s NAV was offset by the cumulative effect of the Fund seeking daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to one-half
 the inverse (-0.5x)
 of the daily performance of the S P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. 
 For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Fund s daily performance had a statistical correlation over 0.99 to one-half
 the inverse of the daily performance of its benchmark. The Fund s per Share NAV increase of 8.8 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the Fund s per Share NAV increase of 32.9 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to a lesser appreciation in the value of the assets held by the Fund during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 The benchmark s decline of 15.8 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the benchmark s decline of 44.4 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, can be attributed to a lesser decrease in the value of near-term futures contracts on the VIX futures curve during the period ended June 30, 2024.

The Fund s per Share NAV decrease of 13.3 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the Fund s per Share NAV decrease of 17.1 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to a lesser depreciation in the value of the assets held by the Fund during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 The benchmark s decline of 5.9 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the benchmark s decline of 8.0 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, can be attributed to a lesser decrease in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar during the period ended June 30, 2024.

 For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Fund s daily performance had a statistical correlation over 0.99 to 2x of the daily performance of its benchmark. The Fund s per Share NAV decrease of 5.6 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the Fund s per Share NAV increase of 2.9 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to depreciation in the value of the assets held by the Fund during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 
 The benchmark s decline of 3.0 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the benchmark s rise of 1.9 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, can be attributed to a decrease in the value of the euro versus the U.S. dollar during the period ended June 30, 2024.

The Fund s per Share NAV increase of 2.8 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the Fund s per Share NAV increase of 103.9 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to lesser appreciation in the value of the assets held by the Fund during the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

 The benchmark s decline of 18.8 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the benchmark s decline of 49.3 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, can be attributed to a lesser decrease in the value of Henry Hub Natural Gas during the period ended June 30, 2024.

 The benchmark s decline of 29.4 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the benchmark s decline of 55.7 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, can be attributed to a lesser decrease in the value of the near-term futures contracts on the VIX futures curve during the period ended June 30, 2024.

(62,485,143) The June 30, 2024 and 2023 short futures notional values are calculated by multiplying the number of contracts held times the valuation price times the contract multiplier. The short notional values will increase (decrease) proportionally with decreases (increases) in the price of the futures contract. Additional gains (losses) associated with these contracts will be equal to any such subsequent decreases (increases) in short notional values, before accounting for spreads or transaction or financing costs. The Fund will generally attempt to adjust its position in Financial Instruments each day to have 0.50 of short exposure to the Index for every 1.00 of net assets. Future period returns, before fees and expenses, cannot be estimated simply by estimating the return of the Index and multiplying by negative one-half.

 to have 2.00 of exposure to the yen for every 1.00 of net assets. Future period

 returns, before fees and expenses, cannot be estimated simply by estimating the appreciation or depreciation of the yen and multiplying by two. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for additional information regarding performance for periods longer than a single day. Counterparty risk related to foreign currency forward contracts is generally limited to the amount of any unrealized gains, although in the event of a counterparty bankruptcy, there could be delays and costs associated with recovering collateral posted in segregated tri-party
 accounts at the Fund s third-party custodian.

Qualitative Disclosure 

 As described in Item 7 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K,
 it is the investment objective of each Geared Fund to seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, which correspond to a multiple, the inverse or an inverse multiple of the daily performance, of its corresponding benchmark (referred to as the Daily Target ). Each Short Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to one-half
 the inverse (-0.5x)
 of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each UltraShort Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x)
 of the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Ultra Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to one and one half times (1.5x) or two times (2x) the daily performance of its corresponding benchmark. Each Matching VIX Fund seeks investment results, before fees and expenses, that match the performance of a benchmark. The Geared Funds do not seek to achieve these stated investment objectives over a period of time greater than a single day because mathematical compounding prevents the Geared Funds from achieving such results. Performance over longer periods of time will be influenced not only by the cumulative period performance of the corresponding benchmark but equally by the intervening volatility of the benchmark as well as fees and expenses, including costs associated with the use of Financial Instruments such as financing costs and trading spreads. Future period returns, before fees and expenses, cannot be estimated simply by estimating the percent change in the corresponding benchmark and multiplying by negative three, negative two, negative one, negative one-half,
 one, one and one-half,
 two or three. Shareholders who invest in the Funds should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for additional information regarding performance for periods longer than a single day. 
 Primary Market Risk Exposure 

The primary market risks that the Funds are exposed to depend on each Fund s investment objective and corresponding benchmark. For example, the primary market risk that the ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil and the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil Funds are exposed to are inverse and long exposure, respectively, to the price of crude oil as measured by the return of holding and periodically rolling crude oil futures contracts (the Bloomberg Commodity Index and its sub-indexes
 are based on the price of rolling futures positions, rather than on the cash price for immediate delivery of the corresponding commodity). 
 Each Fund s exposure to market risk is further influenced by a number of factors, including the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of each Fund s trading strategies and other factors, could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of investors capital. 
 As described in Item 7 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K,
 trading in certain futures contracts or forward agreements involves each Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a commodity underlying a Fund s benchmark at a specified date and price, should it hold such futures contracts or forward agreements into the deliverable period. Should a Fund enter into a contractual commitment to sell a physical commodity, it is required to make delivery of that commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash. Since the repurchase price to which the value of a commodity can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell commodities would expose a Fund to theoretically unlimited risk. 
 Commodity Price Sensitivity 

As further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K,
 the value of the Shares of each Fund relates directly to the value of, and realized profit or loss from, the Financial Instruments and other assets held by the Fund and fluctuations in the price of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. With regard to the Commodity Index Funds or the Commodity Funds, several factors may affect the price of a commodity underlying a Commodity Index Fund or a Commodity Fund, and in turn, the Financial Instruments and other assets, if any, owned by such a Fund. The impact of changes in the price of a physical commodity or of a commodity index (comprised of commodity futures contracts) will affect investors differently depending upon the Fund in which investors invest. Daily increases in the price of an underlying commodity or commodity index will negatively impact the daily performance of Shares of an UltraShort Fund and daily decreases in the price of an underlying commodity or commodity index will negatively impact the daily performance of Shares of an Ultra Fund. 
 Additionally, performance over time is a cumulative effect of geometrically linking each day s leveraged or inverse leveraged returns. For instance, if a corresponding benchmark was up 10 and then down 10 , which would result in a (1.1 0.9)-1
 = -1 
 period benchmark return, the two-day
 period return for a theoretical two-times
 fund would be equal to a (1.2 0.8)-1
 = -4 
 period Fund return (rather than simply two times the period return of the benchmark). 
 Exchange Rate Sensitivity 

As further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K,
 the value of the Shares of each Fund relates directly to the value of, and realized profit or loss from, the Financial Instruments and other assets held by the Fund and fluctuations in the price of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. With regard to the Currency Funds, several factors may affect the value of the foreign currencies or the U.S. dollar, and, in turn, the Financial Instruments and other assets, if any, owned by a Fund. The impact of changes in the price of a currency will affect investors differently depending upon the Fund in which investors invest. Daily increases in the price of a currency will negatively impact the daily performance of Shares of a Short Fund or an UltraShort Fund and daily decreases in the price of a currency will negatively impact the daily performance of Shares of an Ultra Fund.

 Equity Market Volatility Sensitivity 

As further described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K,
 the value of the Shares of each VIX Fund relates directly to the value of, and realized profit or loss from, the Financial Instruments and other assets held by the Fund and fluctuations in the price of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. Several factors may affect the price and/or liquidity of VIX futures contracts and other assets, if any, owned by a VIX Fund. The impact of changes in the price of these assets will affect investors differently depending upon the Fund in which investors invest. 
 Managing Market Risks 

Each Fund seeks to remain fully exposed to the corresponding benchmark at the levels implied by the relevant investment objective (-0.5x,
 -2x,
 1.5x, or 2x), regardless of market direction or sentiment. At the close of the relevant markets each trading day (see NAV calculation times in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies - Final Net Asset Value for Fiscal Period ), each Fund will seek to position its portfolio so that its exposure to its benchmark is consistent with its investment objective. As described in Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K,
 these adjustments are done through the use of various Financial Instruments. Factors common to all Funds that may require portfolio re-positioning
 are creation/redemption activity and index rebalances. 
 For Geared Funds, the impact of the index s movements each day also affects whether the Fund s portfolio needs to be rebalanced. For example, if the index for an Ultra Fund has risen on a given day, net assets of the Fund should rise. As a result, the Fund s long exposure will need to be increased to the extent there are not offsetting factors such as redemption activity. Conversely, if the Index has fallen on a given day, net assets of an Ultra Fund should fall. As a result, the Fund s long exposure will generally need to be decreased. Net assets for Short Funds and UltraShort Funds will generally decrease when the Index rises on a given day, to the extent there are not offsetting factors. As a result, the Fund s short exposure may need to be decreased. As a result, the Fund s short exposure may need to be increased. 
 The use of certain Financial Instruments introduces counterparty risk. A Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the amount it expects to receive from counterparties to Financial Instruments entered into by the Fund. A Fund may be negatively impacted if a counterparty fails to perform its obligations. Each Fund intends to enter into swap and forward agreements only with major global financial institutions that meet certain credit quality standards and monitoring policies. Each Fund may use various techniques to minimize credit risk including early termination or reset and payment, limiting the net amount due from any individual counterparty, and generally requiring that the counterparty post collateral with respect to amounts owed to the Funds, marked to market daily. 
 Most Financial Instruments held by the Funds are unfunded meaning that the Fund will obtain exposure to the corresponding benchmark while still being in possession of its original cash assets. The cash positions that result from use of such Financial Instruments are held in a manner to minimize both interest rate and credit risk. During the reporting period, cash positions were maintained in both non-interest
 bearing and interest bearing demand deposit accounts. The Funds may also invest a portion of this cash in cash equivalents (such as shares of money market funds, bank deposits, bank money market accounts, certain variable rate-demand notes and repurchase agreements collateralized by government securities). 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust, Trust management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s and the Funds disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust and the Funds (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act )) were not effective due to a material weakness with respect to controls related to the classification of the Future Commission Merchant FCM accounts, as of June 30, 2024. As a result, additional analysis was performed as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in the Quarterly Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.

 Remediation Plan for Material Weakness with respect to Controls Related to the Classification of the FCM Accounts

In response to the identified material weakness with respect to controls related to the classification of the FCM accounts, Management has developed and begun implementing a remediation plan to enhance its internal controls over financial reporting with respect to controls related to the classification of the FCM accounts, which generally includes working with the Funds Administrator to enhance procedures and reviews relating to the classification of Futures Commission Merchant balances for financial reporting purposes.

 Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

 As of June 30, 2024, the Trust is not a party to any material legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

 Regulatory and exchange accountability levels may restrict the creation of Creation Units and the operation of the Trust 

Investments in futures contracts are subject to current position limits and accountability levels established by the exchanges. Accordingly, the Sponsor and the Funds may be required to reduce the size of outstanding positions or be restricted from entering into new positions that would otherwise be taken for a Fund or not trade in certain markets on behalf of the Fund in order to comply with those limits or any future limits. These restrictions, if implemented, could limit the ability of each Fund to invest in additional futures contracts, add to existing positions in the desired amount, or create additional Creation Units and could otherwise have a significant negative impact on Fund operations and performance, decreasing a Fund s correlation to the performance of its benchmark, and otherwise preventing a Fund from achieving its investment objective. On May 4, 2020, CME imposed a more restrictive position limit in September 2020 WTI oil futures contracts with respect to the Oil Funds. In response to CME s imposition of a more restrictive position limit, global developments, and other factors, the Sponsor modified certain of the Oil Funds investment strategies to invest in longer-dated futures contracts. In early July 2020, in anticipation of the roll of the Oil Funds benchmark, and in order to help manage the impact of recent extraordinary conditions and volatility in the markets for crude oil and related Financial Instruments, the Sponsor modified certain of the Oil Funds investment strategies to invest in longer-dated futures contracts. 
 Risk that Current Assumptions and Expectations Could Become Outdated As a Result of Global Economic Shocks 

The onset of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
 and its variants has caused significant shocks to global financial markets and economies, with many governments taking extreme actions in an attempt to slow and contain the spread of COVID-19.
 These actions have had, and likely will continue to have if reimposed, a severe economic impact on global economies as economic activity in some instances has essentially ceased. 
 On February 24, 2022, Russia commenced a military attack on Ukraine. The ongoing hostilities between the two countries could result in additional widespread conflict and could have a severe adverse effect on the region and the markets for securities and commodities, including oil. As the war continues, sanctions on Russian exports in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the Russian economy and related markets. How long such conflict and related events will last and whether it will escalate further cannot be predicted. Impacts from the conflicts and related events could have significant impact on a Fund s performance, and the value of an investment in a Fund may decline significantly. 
 The price of futures contracts can change quickly and without warning. If the price of WTI crude oil futures contracts in the future were to decline significantly or reach a negative price, investors in the Ultra Crude Oil Fund could suffer significant losses or lose their entire investment. 
 Extreme market volatility and economic turbulence in the first part of 2020 has led to FCMs increasing margin requirements for certain futures contracts, including nearer-dated WTI crude oil and other oil futures contracts. Some FCMs may impose trading limitations, whether in the form of limits or prohibitions on trading oil futures contracts. If the Oil Funds are subject to increased margin requirements, they will incur increased costs and may not be able to achieve desired exposure. The Oil Funds may not be able to achieve their investment objective if they become subject to heightened margin requirements or trading limitations. 
 Natural Disasters and Public Health Disruptions, such as the COVID-19
 Pandemic, May Have a Significant Negative Impact on the Performance of Each Fund

. 
 Natural or environmental disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis and other severe weather-related phenomena generally, and widespread disease, including public health disruptions, pandemics and epidemics (for example, COVID-19
 including its variants), have been and may continue to be highly disruptive to economies and markets. These conditions have led, and may continue to lead, to increased or extreme market volatility, illiquidity and significant market losses. Such natural disaster and health crises could exacerbate political, social, and economic risks, and result in significant breakdowns, delays, shutdowns, social isolation, civil unrest, periods of high unemployment, shortages in and disruptions to the medical care and consumer goods and services industries, and other disruptions to important global, local and regional supply chains affected, with potential corresponding results on the operating performance of the Funds and their investments. To attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19,
 federal, state, and local governments introduced various forms of vaccine and mask mandates, lockdowns, curfews, and other policy initiatives. However, several of the federal mandates were rolled back or eliminated entirely due to actions taken within the courts. In response to COVID s shock to the labor market

and economy overall. The government drastically increased its federal spending for COVID-related relief packages, which came in the form of increases in unemployment insurance and stimulus packages. A climate of uncertainty and panic, including the contagion of infectious viruses or diseases, may adversely affect global, regional, and local economies and reduce the availability potential investment opportunities and accuracy of economic projections. Further, such events can be highly disruptive to economies and markets, significantly disrupt the operations of individual companies (including, but not limited to, the Funds, the Funds Sponsor and third party service providers), sectors, industries, markets, securities and commodity exchanges, currencies, interest and inflation rates, credit ratings, investor sentiment, and other factors affecting the value of the Funds investments. These factors can cause extreme market volatility, illiquidity, exchange trading suspensions and market closures. For example, market factors may adversely affect the price and liquidity of the Funds investments and potentially increase margins and collateral requirements in ways that have a significant negative impact on Fund performance r make it difficult, or impossible, for a Fund to achieve its investment objective. Under these circumstances, a Fund could have difficulty finding counterparties to transactions, entering or exiting positions at favorable prices and could incur significant losses. Further, Fund counterparties may close out positions with the Funds without notice, at unfavorable times or unfavorable prices, or may choose to transaction on a more limited basis (or not at all). In such cases, it may be difficult or impossible for a Fund to achieve the desired investment exposure with its investment objective. These conditions also can impact the ability of the Funds to complete creation and redemption transactions and disrupt Fund trading in the secondary market. 
 Additionally, public health issues, war and military conflicts (such as Russia s continued military actions against Ukraine that started in February 2022 and the Israel-Hamas conflict and the ensuing conflict), sanctions, acts of terrorism, sustained elevated inflation, supply chain issues or other events could have a significant negative impact on global financial markets and economies. A widespread crisis may also affect the global economy in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen at the current time. How long such events will last and whether they will continue or recur cannot be predicted. Impacts from these events could have significant impact on a Fund s performance, and the value of an investment in the Fund may decline significantly.
