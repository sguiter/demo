Charges that collectively indicated that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company s Reference software
intangible asset was less than its carrying amount as of June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, prior to impairment, the fair value was
 million. As a result, the Company performed an impairment assessment for intangibles in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant
and Equipment . The June 30, 2024 impairment test indicated a decline in the carrying amount of the Reference software intangible
asset and a reduction in the asset s useful life, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of million, which is included
in impairment loss on intangible assets on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of the Reference software
subsequent to impairment was million and is included within intangible assets, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
No further indicators of impairment related to intangible assets were identified during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-looking
statements 

The
information set forth in this report in Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, 
includes Forward-Looking Statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and is subject to the
safe harbor created by those sections. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, projections of revenues and expenses, and
measures of income or loss, status of product development and performance, market opportunity and future demand, partner and customer
engagement, cooperative agreements, strategic plans, future operations, financing needs or plans of MicroVision, Inc. we, 
 our, or us ), as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing. The words anticipate, could, 
 believe, estimate, expect, goal, may, plan, will, 
and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected in our forward-looking statements include risk factors identified below in Item 1A. 

Overview 

MicroVision,
Inc. is a global developer and supplier of lidar hardware and software solutions focused primarily on automotive lidar and advanced driver-assistance
systems ADAS markets where we can deliver safe mobility at the speed of life. We offer a suite of light detection and
ranging, or lidar, sensors and perception and validation software to automotive OEMs, for ADAS and autonomous vehicle AV applications, as well as to complementary markets for non-automotive applications including industrial, robotics and smart infrastructure.
Our long history of developing and commercializing the core components of our lidar hardware and related software, combined with the
experience of the team acquired from Ibeo Automotive Systems Ibeo with automotive-grade qualification, gives us a compelling
advantage as a development and commercial partner. 

Founded
in 1993, MicroVision, Inc. is a pioneer in laser beam scanning, or LBS technology, which is based on our patented expertise in micro-electromechanical
systems, or MEMS, laser diodes, opto-mechanics, electronics, algorithms and software and how those elements are packaged into a small
form factor. Throughout our history, we have combined our proprietary technologies with our development expertise to create innovative
solutions to address existing and emerging market needs, such as augmented reality microdisplay engines; interactive display modules;
consumer lidar components; and, most recently, automotive lidar sensors and software solutions for the automotive market. 

In
January 2023, we acquired certain strategic assets of Germany-based Ibeo, which was founded in 1998 as a lidar hardware and software
provider. Ibeo developed and launched the first lidar sensor to be automotive qualified for serial production with a Tier 1 automotive
supplier and that is currently available in passenger cars by premium OEMs. Ibeo developed software solutions, including perception and
validation software, which are also used by premium OEMs. In addition, Ibeo sold its products for non-automotive uses such as industrial,
smart infrastructure and robotics applications. 

For
the automotive market, our integrated solution combines our MEMS-based dynamic-range lidar sensor and perception software, to be integrated
on our custom ASIC, targeted for sale to premium automotive OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers. Our ADAS solution is intended to leverage
edge computing and custom ASICs to enable our hardware and perception software to be integrated into an OEM s ADAS stack. 

In
addition to our dynamic-range and long-range MAVIN sensor and perception software solution for the automotive market, our product suite
includes our short-range flash-based MOVIA lidar sensor as well as perception software, for automotive and industrial applications, including
smart infrastructure, robotics, and other commercial segments. Also, our validation software tool, the MOSAIK suite, is targeted for
use by OEMs and Tier 1s for validating vehicle sensors for ADAS and AV applications, but we have reduced our development and sales efforts
on this product. As such, in the first half of 2024, in an effort to better align our resources away from MOSAIK, we performed a restructuring
and reorganization to focus on MAVIN and MOVIA driven by perception software. While this 37 reduction in workforce resulted in approximately
 5.8 million in expenses through the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we expect this to extend our financial runway through reduced personnel expenses
and provide operational efficiencies that will streamline cash burn. See Item 1, Note 13. Restructuring Charges for additional
discussion. 

In
the recent past, we developed micro-display concepts and designs for use in head-mounted augmented reality, or AR, headsets and developed
a 1440i MEMS module supporting AR headsets. We also developed an interactive display solution targeted at the smart speaker market and
a small consumer lidar sensor for use indoors with smart home systems. 

Although
our development and productization efforts are now solely focused on our lidar sensors and related software solutions, our revenue in
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 was largely derived from one customer, Microsoft Corporation, related to components that we developed
for a high-definition display system. Our arrangement with this customer generated royalty income, which we do not expect will continue
in future periods. 

21 

To
date, we have been unable to secure customers at the scale needed to successfully launch our products. We have incurred significant losses
since inception and we expect to continue to incur significant losses in the near term. We have funded our operations to date primarily
through the sale of common stock, convertible preferred stock, warrants, the issuance of convertible debt and, to a lesser extent, from
development contract revenues, product sales, and licensing activities. In October 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement
(the Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor (the Holder for the purchase of a senior secured
convertible note (the Convertible Note up to 75.0 million. See Item 1, Note 14. Subsequent Events. 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that materially affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on a
continuous basis. We base our estimates on historical data, terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the consumer
display and 3D sensing industries, information provided by our current and prospective customers and strategic partners, information
available from other outside sources and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The
results form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no
significant changes to our critical accounting judgments, policies, and estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023.

Revenues
are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration
that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue either at a point in time, or over time, depending
upon the characteristics of the individual contract. If control of the deliverable(s) occurs over time, the revenue is recognized in
proportion to the transfer of control. If control passes to the customer only upon completion and transfer of the asset, revenue is recognized
at the completion of the contract. 

The
decrease in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a decrease
in sales related to an OEM for our MOSAIK software, partially offset by royalties from an automotive supplier. 

The
increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to the sale of sensors
to an existing industrial customer for agricultural equipment and service parts, an increase in shipments of MOVIA L sensors to Daimler
Truck North America and affiliates as part of their RFQ evaluation process, and increased sales to a second industrial customer. These
increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales related to an OEM for our MOSAIK software.

Cost
of revenue includes both direct and allocated indirect costs of products and services sold to customers. Direct costs include labor,
materials, reserves for estimated warranty expenses, and other costs incurred directly, or charged to us by our contract manufacturers,
in the manufacture of these products. Indirect costs include labor, overhead, and other costs associated with operating our manufacturing
capabilities and our research and development department. Overhead includes the costs of procuring, inspecting and storing material,
facility and other costs, and is allocated to cost of revenue based on the proportion of indirect labor which supported revenue activities. 

22 

Cost
of revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the product mix and volume, the level of overhead expense
and the volume of direct material purchased. The increase in cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from sensors in 2024. The change in cost of revenue was driven primarily
by the revenue mix as 2023 had higher MOSAIK software revenue compared to sale of sensors in 2024.

Research
and development expense consists of compensation related costs of employees and contractors engaged in internal research and product
development activities, direct material to support development programs, laboratory operations, outsourced development and processing
work, and other operating expenses. We assign our research and development resources based on the business opportunity of the available
projects, the skill mix of the resources available and the contractual commitments we have made to our customers. We believe that a substantial
level of continuing research and development expense will be required to further develop our scanning technology. 

The
decrease in research and development expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was
primarily due to lower salary and benefits expense and non-cash compensation of 4.8 million as a result of 2024 restructuring events,
lower subcontractor fees of 1.6 million primarily related to subcontractors used in 2023 on our MOVIA lidar sensors, lower direct materials
and equipment costs of 0.2 million, and lower depreciation expense of 0.1 million. The decrease was partially offset by higher IT and
software costs of 0.2 million. 

The
decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower salary and benefits
expense and non-cash compensation of 5.9 million as a result of 2024 restructuring events, lower depreciation expense of 0.7 million,
lower freight costs of 0.2 million, and lower direct materials and equipment costs of 0.2 million. These decreases were partially offset
by restructuring charges of 5.1 million, higher IT and software costs of 0.7 million, and higher subcontractor fees of 0.2 million.

The
decrease in sales, marketing, general and administrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower salary and benefits expense and non-cash compensation of 1.5 million as a result of
2024 restructuring events, lower advertising costs of 0.3 million, lower subcontractor fees of 0.2 million, lower professional
fees of 0.1 million, lower depreciation expense of 0.1 million, and lower business insurance fees of 0.1 million due to favorable
rates obtained. These decreases were partially offset by higher IT and software costs of 0.1 million. 

23 

The
decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower professional
fees of 1.6 million primarily related to legal and audit fees associated with the acquisition of Ibeo in 2023, lower salary and benefits
expense and non-cash compensation of 1.6 million as a result of 2024 restructuring events, lower subcontractor fees of 0.7 million,
lower business insurance fees of 0.5 million due to favorable rates obtained, and lower advertising costs of 0.3 million. These decreases
were partially offset by restructuring charges of 0.7 million, higher IT and software costs of 0.4 million, and higher trade show expense
of 0.2 million.

Impairment
loss on intangible assets includes impairment charges on intangible assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management
identified impairment indicators related to MOSAIK software. We performed an assessment of projected future cash flows which resulted
in a 3.0 million impairment charge and reduction in the estimated useful life of the asset. See

The
decrease in other income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to a payment
received in 2023 of 3.0 million as an incentive to terminate our previous building lease. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
have incurred significant losses since inception. We have funded operations to date primarily through the sale of common stock,
convertible preferred stock, warrants, the issuance of convertible debt and, to a lesser extent, from development contract revenues,
product sales, and licensing activities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total liquidity of 43.2 million including 16.5
million in cash and cash equivalents and 26.7 million in short-term investment securities. We also have approximately 122.6
million availability left on our existing 150.0 million ATM facility that was put in place in the first quarter of 2024. After
giving effect to the net proceeds of 38.0 million from the first 45.0 million tranche of the Convertible Note, the Company expects
to have approximately 81.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and access to 153 million of additional capital, including 122.6
million under its existing ATM facility and 30.0 million from the remaining commitment pursuant to the Convertible Note. See Item
1. Note 14, Subsequent Events . Based on our current operating plan, we anticipate that we have sufficient cash and cash
equivalents to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. 

Operating
activities 

Cash
used in operating activities totaled 53.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in
operating activities of 50.5 million during the same period in 2023. Cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from cash
used to fund our net loss, after adjusting for non-cash charges such as share-based compensation, intangible impairment expense,
depreciation and amortization charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in cash used in operating
activities are primarily attributable to severance payments related to the 2024 restructuring events and timing of customer payments in 2024. 

While
the 2024 restructuring events produced an initial increase in cash outflows, we expect operating cash outflows to decrease in the
future, as evidenced by the decline in cash used in operating activities each quarter of 2024. Specifically, for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities totaled 14.1 million, as compared to 18.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 20.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

We
expect to make additional payments to our contract manufacturing partner in connection with the buildup of MOVIA sensor inventory
for direct sales to both automotive and non-automotive customers totaling approximately 4.8 million over the remainder of 2024
through 2025 in line with agreed-upon deliveries. 

24 

Investing
activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 3.8 million compared to net cash provided by investing
activities of 21.4 million during the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased short-term
investment securities totaling 25.6 million and sold short-term investment securities totaling 28.3 million, compared to purchases
of 27.1 million and sales of 61.7 million in the same period of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased property and equipment totaling 0.3 million compared to 2.0 million in
the same period in 2023. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we made payments totaling 6.3 million related to the acquisition of Ibeo assets compared to 11.2 million
in the same period in 2023. 

Financing
activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled 26.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided
by financing activities of 60.8 million during the same period of 2023. Proceeds received from stock option exercises totaled 0.1 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.2 million during the same period in 2023. Net proceeds from issuance of
common stock were 26.1 million during nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 60.6 million during the same period in 2023. 

Additionally,
subsequent to September 30, 2024, we received approximately 38.0 million in net proceeds, inclusive of debt issuance costs, from the issuance of 45.0 million senior secured convertible
notes. See Item 1. Note 14, Subsequent Events . 

The
following is a list of our financing activities during 2024 and 2023. 

In
 March 2024, we entered into a 150.0 million ATM equity offering agreement with Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., Mizuho Securities
 USA LLC and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (collectively, the Agents ). Under the agreement, we are able, at our discretion,
 to offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to 150.0 million through or directly to the Agents.
 As of September 2024, we completed sales under such sales agreement of 15.0 million shares for net proceeds of 26.1 million. As
 of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 122.6 million available under this sales agreement. 

In
 June 2021, we entered into a 140.0 million ATM equity offering agreement with Craig-Hallum. Under the agreement we were able, at
 our discretion, to offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to 140.0 million through Craig-Hallum.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had issued 8.3 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 81.8 million under this ATM agreement.
 During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we issued 5.0 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 12.5 million under
 the agreement. The sales agreement was terminated in June 2023. 

In
 June 2023, we entered into a 45.0 million ATM equity offering agreement with Craig-Hallum.
 Under the agreement, we were able, at our discretion, to offer and sell shares of our
 common stock having an aggregate value of up to 45.0 million through Craig-Hallum. As of June 30, 2023, we had completed sales under
 such sales agreement, having sold 10.9 million shares for net proceeds of 43.9 million. As of June 30, 2023, we had issued
 257,000 shares for net proceeds of 925,000 that was received in July 2023. The 925,000 was classified as subscriptions receivable
 on our June 30, 2023 balance sheet and is not included in the cash balance as of June 30, 2023. No further shares are available for
 sales under this agreement. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest
Rate and Market Liquidity Risk 

As
of September 30, 2024, all of our cash and cash equivalents have variable interest rates; however, we believe our exposure to market
and interest rate risk is not material. Due to the generally short-term maturities of our investment securities, we believe that the
market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is not significant. We do not believe that inflation has had a material
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, we do anticipate our labor costs to increase as a result
of inflationary pressures. 

Our
investment policy generally directs that the investment managers should select investments to achieve the following goals: principal
preservation, adequate liquidity and return. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents are comprised of short-term highly

Foreign
Exchange Rate Risk 

Our
major contract and collaborative research and development agreements, product sales, and licensing activity payments are currently made
in U.S. dollars or Euros. Changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to the Euro and other currencies may affect revenue and other
operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. In addition, our international subsidiary financial statements are denominated in Euros.
As such, the consolidated financial statements will continue to remain subject to the impact of foreign currency translation as our international
operations continue to expand. In the future, we may enter into foreign currency hedges to offset material exposure to currency fluctuations
when we can adequately determine the timing and amounts of the exposure. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,
we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report and, based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that
occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II. 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
are subject to various claims and pending or threatened lawsuits in the normal course of business. We are not currently party to any
other legal proceedings that management believes are reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

You
should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially
affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and operating results. 

Risk
Factors Related to Our Business 

We
have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant losses in the future. 

We
have had substantial losses since our inception. We cannot assure you that we will ever become or remain profitable. 

As
 of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 831.1 million. 
 
 We
 incurred net losses of 765.4 million from inception through 2023, and a net loss of 65.8
 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The
likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered by companies formed
to develop and commercialize new technologies. In particular, our operations to date have focused primarily on research and development
of our Laser Beam Scanning, or LBS, technology system, including products built around that technology
such as our automotive lidar sensors, and development of demonstration units. We are unable to accurately estimate future revenues
and operating expenses based upon historical performance. 

We
cannot be certain that we will succeed in obtaining additional development revenue or commercializing our technology or products at scale.
In light of these factors, we expect to continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flow through 2024 and the foreseeable
future. There is significant risk that we will not achieve positive cash flow at any time in the future. 

We
will require additional capital to fund our operations at the level necessary to implement our business plan. Raising additional capital
will dilute the value of current shareholders investment in us. Additionally, we may be unable to raise capital on terms acceptable
to us. 

Based
on our current operating plan, we anticipate that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations for at least the
next 12 months. We will, however, require additional capital to fund our operating plan past that time. We will seek to obtain additional
capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities, development revenue, product sales, and/or licensing activities. There can
be no assurance that any such efforts to obtain additional capital would be successful. 

We
are currently focused on developing and commercializing our automotive lidar solution. This involves introducing new technologies into
an emerging market which creates significant uncertainty about our ability to accurately project the amounts and timing of revenue, costs,
and cash flows. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the commercial success of our technologies,
the rate at which OEMs introduce systems incorporating our products and technologies and the market acceptance and competitive position
of such systems. Our expenses increased significantly as a result of the January 2023 Ibeo acquisition and related headcount increase,
though in the first half of 2024 we effectuated meaningful headcount reductions. If
revenues continue to be less than we anticipate, if the mix of revenues and the associated margins vary from anticipated amounts, or
if expenses exceed the amounts budgeted, we may require additional capital earlier than expected to fund our operations. In addition,
our operating plan provides for the development of strategic relationships with suppliers of components, products and systems, and equipment
manufacturers that may require additional investments by us. 

Additional
capital may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or on a timely basis. Raising additional
capital may involve issuing securities with rights and preferences that are senior to our common stock and may dilute the value of our
current shareholders investment in us. If adequate capital resources are not available on a timely basis, we may consider limiting
our operations substantially and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. This limitation of operations could include reducing
investments in our research and development projects, staff, operating costs, and capital expenditures which could jeopardize our ability
to achieve our business goals or satisfy our customer requirements. 

26 

Risks
Related to our Financial Statements and Results 

Our
revenue is generated from a small number of customers and, as we have experienced recently and in the past, losing a significant customer
negatively impacts our revenue. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a leading supplier of agricultural equipment manufacturer
 accounted for 1.7 million in revenue, representing 55 of our total revenue. A major global
trucking OEM accounted for 0.6 million in revenue, representing 20 of our total revenue, and an automotive supplier accounted
for 0.3 million in revenue, representing 10 of our total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, one customer accounted
for 0.8 million in revenue, representing 38 of our total revenue, a second customer accounted for 0.4 million in revenue, representing
17 of our total revenue, a third customer accounted for 0.2 million in revenue, representing 11 of our total revenue, and a fourth
customer accounted for 0.2 million in revenue, representing 10 of our total revenue. 

We
have, in the past, identified a material weakness in our internal controls. 

In
the second quarter of 2021, we identified a material weakness in the controls that support our determination of the grant date of equity
awards. If we identify further material weaknesses in our internal controls, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements
and a failure to meet our reporting obligations. Any such failure could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial
reports, harm our reputation, and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

Our
internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal year 2024 include controls of our subsidiary, MicroVision GmbH, which became a
significant subsidiary upon the closing of our acquisition of assets from Ibeo in 2023. Given the added complexity stemming from the
inclusion of our German subsidiary within our control environment, the risk of a material weakness in internal controls will be higher
than it has been to date. 

Our
stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our
common stock could incur substantial losses. 

Our
stock price has fluctuated significantly in the past, has recently been volatile, and may be volatile in the future. Over the
52-week period ending November 4, 2024, our common stock has traded at a low of 0.83 and a high of 2.98. We
may continue to experience sustained depression or substantial volatility in our stock price in the foreseeable future unrelated to
our operating performance or prospects. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a loss per share of
 (0.45). 

As
a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price for our common
stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following: 

investor
 reaction to our business strategy; 

the
 success of competitive products or technologies; 

strategic
 developments; 

the
 timing and results of our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our lidar sensors and ADAS solutions; 

changes
 in regulatory or industry standards applicable to our technologies; 

variations
 in our or our competitors financial and operating results; 

developments
 concerning our collaborations or partners; 

developments
 or disputes with any third parties that supply, manufacture, sell, or market any of our products; 

developments
 or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent
 protection for our technology; 

actual
 or perceived defects in any of our products, if commercialized, and any related product liability claims; 

our
 ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it; 

declines
 in the market prices of stocks generally; 

27 

trading
 volume of our common stock; 

sales
 of our common stock by us or our stockholders; 

general
 economic, industry and market conditions; and 

the
 effects of other events or factors, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health
 epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other
 adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere. 

Since
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past, has suffered recent declines and may be volatile in the future, investors in
our common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action
litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs
and diversion of management s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current levels or that future
sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors. 

Additionally,
securities of certain companies have in the past few years experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short
sellers of shares of common stock, known as a short squeeze. These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in both
the stock prices of those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly
inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies
at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment, as in many cases the price per share
has declined steadily as interest in those stocks has abated. There can be no assurance that our shares will not be subject to a short
squeeze in the future, and investors may lose a significant portion or all of their investment if they purchase our shares at a rate
that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value. 

If
we are unable to maintain our listing on The Nasdaq Global Market, it could become more difficult to sell our stock in the public market. 

Our
common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Market. To maintain our listing on this market, we must meet Nasdaq s listing
maintenance standards. As a result of recent declines and volatility in our stock price, there is a significant risk that we could
fail to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of 1.00 per share for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global
Market. If we are unable to continue to meet Nasdaq s listing maintenance standards for any reason, such as our minimum bid
price falling below 1 for 30 consecutive trading days, our common stock could be delisted from The Nasdaq Global Market. If our
common stock were delisted, we may seek to list our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market, the NYSE American or on a regional
stock exchange or, if one or more broker-dealer market makers comply with applicable requirements, the over-the-counter, or OTC,
market. Listing on such other market or exchange could reduce the liquidity of our common stock. If our common stock were to trade
in the OTC market, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of, the
common stock. 

A
delisting from The Nasdaq Global Market and failure to obtain listing on another market or exchange would subject our A
delisting from The Nasdaq Global Market and failure to obtain listing on another market or exchange would subject our common stock to
so-called penny stock rules that impose additional sales practice and market-making requirements on broker-dealers who sell or make a
market in such securities. Consequently, removal from The Nasdaq Global Market and failure to obtain listing on another market or exchange
could affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell or make a market in our common stock and the ability of purchasers
of our common stock to sell their securities in the secondary market. 

On
November 4, 2024, the closing price of our common stock was 1.00 per share. 

Our
lack of financial resources relative to our competitors may limit our revenues, potential profits, overall market share, or value. 

Our
products and solutions compete with other pureplay lidar developers, many of which have recently gone public through de-SPAC transactions
and therefore have substantially greater financial resources than we have. We also face competition from OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers that
have internally developed lidar sensors. All of these OEMS and Tier 1s are significantly larger, more well-resourced, have long operating
histories and enjoy relevant brand recognition. Because of their greater resources, our competitors may develop or commercialize products
more quickly than us and have access to more entrenched sales channels. This imbalance in financial resources and access could result
for us in reduced revenues, lower margins or loss of market share, any of which could reduce the value of our business. Additionally,
for a variety of reasons, customers may choose to purchase from suppliers that have substantially greater financial or other resources
than we have. 

28 

Risks
Related to Fundraising Transactions and the Convertible Note 

You
will experience further dilution if we issue additional equity securities in future fundraising transactions. 

We
are generally not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or
exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. If we issue additional common stock, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock (including additional convertible notes to the Holder of the
Convertible Note issued by us in October 2024 pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement dated October 14, 2024), our
stockholders could experience additional dilution, and any such issuances may result in downward pressure on the price of our common
stock. 

Sales
of shares of our common stock by the Holder of the October 2024 Convertible Note may cause our stock price to
decline. 

Sales
of substantial amounts of our shares of common stock in the public market by the Holder of the Convertible Note issued by us in October 2024, or the perception that those sales may
occur, could cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline and impair our ability to raise capital through the
sale of additional shares of our common stock. 

We
do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential
increases in the price of our common stock. 

At
the present time, we intend to use available funds to finance our operations. Accordingly, while payment of dividends rests within the
discretion of our board of directors, no cash dividends on our common shares have been declared or paid by us and we have no intention
of paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases
in the price of our common stock 

There
are risks associated with our outstanding Convertible Note, and any additional convertible notes that may be issued under the
October 2024 Securities Purchase Agreement, that could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

On October 23, 2024, we issued a Convertible Note in the principal amount of 45.0 million. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase
Argument dated October 14, 2024, we can issue up to an aggregate principal amount of 75.0 million in senior secured convertible
notes to the Holder of the October 2024 Convertible Note, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The terms of any additional
convertible notes issued under the Purchase Agreement would be similar to those under the Convertible Note. 

The
Convertible Note provides for certain events of default, such as our failing to make timely payments under the Convertible Note and failing
to timely comply with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The Purchase Agreement and the Convertible Note also contain customary
affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness, the creation of additional liens on our
assets, and entering into investments, as well as a minimum liquidity requirement. 

Our
ability to remain in compliance with the covenants under the Convertible Note depends on, among other things, our operating performance,
competitive developments, financial market conditions and stock exchange listing of our common stock, all of which are significantly
affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We are not able to control many of these factors. Accordingly, our cash
flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal on the Convertible Note and any additional convertible notes issued under the
Purchase Agreement or meet our other obligations under the Purchase Agreement. Our level of indebtedness under the Purchase Agreement
could have other important consequences, including the following: 

We
 may need to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal on the Convertible Note and any additional
 convertible notes issued under the Purchase Agreement, which would reduce funds available to us for other purposes such as working
 capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

29 

We
 may be unable to refinance our indebtedness under the Purchase Agreement or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital
 expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes; 

We
 may be unable to comply with financial and other covenants in the Convertible Note, which could result in an event of default that,
 if not cured or waived, may result in acceleration of the Convertible Note and any additional convertible notes issued under the
 Purchase Agreement and would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects, could cause us to lose the rights to our intellectual
 property, and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation; 

The
 conversion of the Convertible Note and any additional convertible notes issued under the Purchase Agreement could result in significant
 dilution of our common stock, which could result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price
 of our common stock to decline; and 

We
 may be more vulnerable to an economic downturn or recession and adverse developments in our business. 

There
can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. 

Our
obligations to the Holder under the October 2024 Convertible Note, and any additional convertible notes, are secured by a security
interest in all of our bank and securities accounts, now owned and hereafter created or acquired, and if we default on those
obligations, the Holder could foreclose on our bank and securities accounts. 

Our
obligations under the Convertible Note, and any additional convertible notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and the related transaction documents, are secured by
a security interest in all of our bank and securities accounts, now owned and hereafter created or acquired. As a result, if we
default on our obligations under the Convertible Note, or any additional convertible notes, the collateral agent on behalf of the
Holder could foreclose on the security interests and liquidate some or all of our bank and securities accounts, which would harm our
business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease operations and investors may lose
all or part of your investment. 

Risks
Related to Our Operations 

Difficulty
in qualifying a contract manufacturer, Tier 1 partner, or foundry for our products, or experiencing changes in our supply chain, could
cause delays that may result in lost future revenues and damaged customer relationships. 

Historically,
we have relied on single or limited-source suppliers to manufacture our products. Establishing and maintaining a relationship with a
contract manufacturer, automotive Tier 1 partner, or foundry is a time-consuming process, as our unique technologies may require significant
manufacturing process adaptation to achieve full manufacturing capacity. To the extent that we are not able to establish or maintain
a relationship with a contract manufacturer, Tier 1 partner, or foundry in a timely manner or at prices or on other terms that are acceptable
to us, we may be unable to meet contract or production milestones. Moreover, changes in our supply chain could result in increased cost
and delays and subject us to risks and uncertainties regarding, but not limited to, product warranty, product liability and quality control
standards. The loss of any single or limited-source supplier, the failure of any of these suppliers to perform as expected or the disruption
in the supply chain of components from these suppliers could cause significant delays in product deliveries, which could result in lost
future revenues and damaged customer relationships. 

Historically,
we have been dependent on third parties to develop, manufacture, sell, and market products incorporating our technology. 

Our
business strategy for commercializing our technology in products has historically included entering into development, manufacturing,
licensing, sales and marketing arrangements with OEMs, ODMs and other third parties. These arrangements reduce our level of control over
production and distribution and may subject us to risks and uncertainties regarding, but not limited to, product warranty, product liability
and quality control standards. 

We
cannot be certain that we will be able to negotiate arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, or that these arrangements will be successful
in yielding commercially viable products. If we cannot establish or maintain these arrangements, we would require additional capital
to undertake such activities on our own and would require extensive manufacturing, sales and marketing expertise that we do not currently
possess and that may be difficult to obtain. 

In
addition, we could encounter significant delays in introducing our products and technology or find that the development, manufacture
or sale of products incorporating our technology would not be feasible. To the extent that we enter into development, manufacturing,
licensing, sales and marketing or other arrangements, our revenues will depend upon the performance of third parties. We cannot be certain
that any such arrangements will be successful. 

30 

We
could face lawsuits related to our use of LBS technology or other technologies, which would be costly, and any adverse outcome could
limit our ability to commercialize our technologies or products. 

We
are aware of several patents held by third parties that relate to certain aspects of light scanning displays, 3D sensing products, and
other technologies that are core to our sensor hardware. These patents could be used as a basis to challenge the validity, limit the
scope or limit our ability to obtain additional or broader patent rights of our patents. A successful challenge to the validity of our
patents could limit our ability to commercialize our technology or products incorporating our LBS technology and, consequently, materially
reduce our ability to generate revenues. Moreover, we cannot be certain that patent holders or other third parties will not claim infringement
by us with respect to current and future technology. Because U.S. patent applications are held and examined in secrecy, it is also possible
that presently pending U.S. applications could eventually be issued with claims that could be infringed by our products or our technology. 

The
defense and prosecution of a patent suit would be costly and time-consuming, even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us. An
adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could subject us to significant costs, require others and us to cease selling products
incorporating our technology, require us to cease licensing our technology or require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties.
Such licenses, if available, would increase our operating expenses. Moreover, if claims of infringement are asserted against our future
co-development partners or customers, those partners or customers may seek indemnification from us for any damages or expenses they incur. 

If
we fail to manage expansion effectively, our revenue and expenses could be adversely affected. 

Our
ability to successfully offer products incorporating our technologies and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires
an effective planning and management process. The growth in business and relationships with customers and other third parties has placed,
and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management systems and resources. We will need to continue to improve our financial
and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, and will need to continue to train and manage our workforce. We continue to
strengthen our compliance programs, including our compliance programs related to product certifications (in particular, certifications
applicable to the automotive market), export controls, privacy and cybersecurity and anti-corruption. We may not be able to implement
improvements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing controls, programs, systems and procedures, which
could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial results. 

We
target customers that are large companies with substantial negotiating power and potentially competitive internal solutions; if we are
unable to sell our products to these customers, our prospects will be adversely affected. 

Our
potential customers, automotive OEMs in particular, are large, multinational companies with substantial negotiating power relative to
us and, in some instances, may have internal solutions that are competitive to our products. These large, multinational companies also
have significant resources, which may allow them to acquire or develop competitive technologies either independently or in partnership
with others. Accordingly, even after investing significant resources to develop a product, we may not secure a series production award
or, even after securing a series production award, may not be able to commercialize a product on profitable terms. If our products are
not selected by these large companies or if these companies develop or acquire competitive technology or negotiate terms that are disadvantageous
to us, it will have an adverse effect on our business prospects. 

Our
technology and products may be subject to environmental, health and safety regulations that could increase our development and production
costs. 

Our
technologies and products could become subject to environmental, health and safety regulations or amendments that could negatively impact
our ability to commercialize our technologies and products. Compliance with any such current or new regulations would likely increase
the cost to develop and commercialize products, and violations may result in fines, penalties or suspension of production. If we become
subject to any environmental, health, or safety laws or regulations that require us to cease or significantly change our operations to
comply, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. 

Our
operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide political and economic uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets
we address. 

At
various times in our history, including in the recent past, general worldwide economic conditions have experienced downturns due to slower
economic activity, concerns about inflation, increased energy costs, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital
spending, and adverse business conditions. Any continuation or worsening of global economic and financial conditions could materially
adversely affect: (i) our ability to raise, or the cost of, needed capital, (ii) demand for our current and future products, and (iii)
our ability to commercialize products. Additionally, the outbreak of wars or infectious diseases, as recently experienced, may cause
an unexpected deterioration in economic conditions. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent
economic recovery, worldwide, regionally or in the automotive or technology industries. 

31 

Because
we have recently expanded and plan to continue expanding our international operations and using foreign suppliers and manufacturers,
our operating results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory and other factors in foreign countries. 

During
2021, we established an office in Germany and on January 31, 2023, we completed our acquisition of certain assets of Ibeo, with the result
that we now have more employees and operations in Germany than in the U.S. In addition, we currently use foreign suppliers and partners
and plan to continue to do so to manufacture current and future components and products, where appropriate. These international operations
are subject to inherent risks, which may adversely affect us, including, but not limited to: 

Political
 and economic instability, international terrorism and the outbreak of war, such as the Russian invasion and
 continuing war against Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East; 

High
 levels of inflation, as has historically been the case in a number of countries in Asia; 

Burdens
 and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws, regulations and sanctions; 

Foreign
 taxes and duties; 

Changes
 in tariff rates or other trade, tax or monetary policies; 

Changes
 or volatility in currency exchange rates and interest rates; 

Global
 or regional health crises, such as COVID-19 or other epidemics; and 

Disruptions
 in global supply chains. 

We
have recently made and may in the future make acquisitions. If we fail to successfully select, execute or integrate our acquisitions,
then our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

On
December 1, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets from Ibeo Automotive Systems GmbH. We expended
significant management time and effort, as well as capital, identifying, evaluating, negotiating, and executing this transaction and,
since the closing of the acquisition on January 31, 2023, we have invested additional time and capital working to integrate our new Hamburg-
and Detroit-based teams and operations. We cannot guarantee that these integration efforts will be successful, that the goals of the
acquisition will be realized, or that the increase to our operating expenses or cash requirements will be manageable. During the first
half of 2024, we downsized our Germany operations. 

In
the future, we may again undertake acquisitions to add new products and technologies, acquire talent, gain new sales channels or enter
into new markets or sales territories. In addition to possible stockholder approval, we may need approvals and licenses from relevant
government authorities for the acquisitions and to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased delay
and costs, and may disrupt our business strategy if we fail to do so. Furthermore, acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new
assets, businesses, key personnel, customers, vendors and suppliers require significant attention from our management and could result
in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our operations. Acquired assets
or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect. Acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash,
potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of significant goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses
for other intangible assets, and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying
and consummating acquisitions may be significant. 

Before
our acquisition of assets from Ibeo, we had no experience with acquisitions or the integration of acquired technology and personnel.
Failure to successfully identify, complete, manage, and integrate acquisitions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations and could cause our stock price to decline. 

Our
suppliers or manufacturing partners facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster or labor strike, either
of which would materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 

A
major catastrophe, such as an earthquake, monsoon, flood, infectious disease including the COVID-19 virus, or other natural disaster,
labor strike, or work stoppage at our suppliers or manufacturers partners facilities or our customers, could result in
a prolonged interruption of our business. A disruption resulting from any one of these events could cause significant delays in product
shipments and the loss of sales and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations,
and cash flows. 

If
we are unable to obtain effective intellectual property protection for our products, processes and technologies, we may be unable to
compete with other companies. 

Intellectual
property protection for our products, processes and technologies is important and uncertain. If we do not obtain effective intellectual
property protection for our products, processes and technologies, we may be subject to increased competition. Our commercial success
will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our key technologies by securing valid and enforceable patents
and effectively maintaining unpatented technologies as trade secrets. 

32 

We
protect our proprietary technologies by seeking to obtain United States and foreign patents in our name, or licenses to third party patents,
related to proprietary technologies, inventions, and improvements that may be important to the development of our business. However,
our patent position involves complex legal and factual questions. The standards that the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. 

Additionally,
the scope of patents is subject to interpretation by courts and their validity can be subject to challenges and defenses, including challenges
and defenses based on the existence of prior art. Consequently, we cannot be certain as to the extent to which we will be able to obtain
patents for our new products and technologies or the extent to which the patents that we already own protect our products and technologies.
Reduction in scope of protection or invalidation of our licensed or owned patents, or our inability to obtain new patents, may enable
other companies to develop products that compete directly with ours on the basis of the same or similar technologies. 

We
also rely on the law of trade secrets to protect unpatented know-how and technologies to maintain our competitive position. We try to
protect this know-how and our technologies by limiting access to the trade secrets to those of our employees, contractors and partners,
with a need-to-know such information and by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as our
employees, consultants and business partners. Any of these parties could breach the agreements and disclose our trade secrets or confidential
information, or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. If any trade secret not protected by a patent were
to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be negatively affected. 

We
could be subject to significant product liability claims that could be time-consuming and costly, divert management attention and adversely
affect our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage. 

We
could be subject to product liability claims if any of the product applications are alleged to be defective or cause harmful effects.
For example, because some of the scanning modules incorporating our LBS technology could scan a low power beam of colored light into
the user s eye, the testing, manufacture, marketing and sale of these products involve an inherent risk that product liability
claims will be asserted against us. 

Additionally,
any misuse of our technologies or products incorporating our technologies by end users or third parties that obtain access to our technologies
could result in negative publicity and could harm our brand and reputation. Product liability claims or other claims related to our products
or our technologies, regardless of their outcome, could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation, divert management
time and attention, require us to pay significant damages, harm our reputation or hinder acceptance of our products. Any successful product
liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable
terms. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability
claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products and technologies. 

Our
operations could be adversely impacted by information technology system failures, network disruptions, or cyber security incidents. 

We
rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, store, and protect electronic data between our employees, customers, manufacturing
partners and suppliers. Our systems and the third parties we rely on for related services are vulnerable to actual or attempted cybersecurity
incidents, such as attacks by hackers, acts of vandalism, malware, social engineering, denial or degradation of service attacks, computer
viruses, software bugs or vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, misplaced or lost data, human
errors, malicious insiders or other similar events. Such systems are also susceptible to other disruptions due to events beyond our control,
including, but are not limited to, natural disasters, power loss, and telecommunications failures. Our system redundancy may be inadequate
and our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or insufficient to account for all eventualities. 

As
security incidents have become more prevalent across industries we will need to continually examine, modify and update our systems. These
updates or improvements may require implementation costs. In addition, we may not be able to monitor and react to all developments in
a timely manner. The measures we do adopt may prove ineffective. 

33 

Any
failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with current and future regulatory or customer-driven privacy, data protection, and information
security requirements, or to prevent or mitigate cyber incidents, could harm our business and expose us to potential litigation, liability,
remediation costs, investigation costs, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation and loss of customers. While we maintain insurance
coverage to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all claims that
may arise, should such an event occur. 

We,
and certain of our third-party vendors, collect and store personal information in connection with human resources operations and other
aspects of our business. While we obtain assurances that any third parties we provide data to will protect this information and, where
we believe appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by
us or by third parties may be compromised and expose us to liability for such breach. 

Loss
of any of our key personnel or inability to attract new personnel could have a negative effect on the operation of our business. 

Our
success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel and on our ability to attract and retain qualified new personnel. Achievement
of our business objectives will require substantial additional expertise in the areas of sales and marketing, research and product development
and manufacturing. Competition for qualified personnel in these fields is intense, and the inability to attract and retain additional
highly skilled personnel, or the loss of key personnel, could hinder our ability to compete effectively in the automotive or technology
markets and adversely affect our business strategy execution and results of operations. 

Risks
Related to Development for the Automotive Industry 

We
invest significant time and resources seeking OEM selection of our products and solutions. If our products and solutions are not selected
for inclusion in ADAS systems by automotive OEMs or automotive Tier 1 suppliers after incurring substantial expenditures in these efforts,
our future business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. 

Automotive
OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers design and develop ADAS technology over several years, undertaking extensive testing and qualification processes
prior to selecting a product such as our lidar sensors and software for use in a particular system, product or vehicle model because
such products will function as part of a larger system or platform and must meet certain other specifications. We have invested and will
continue to invest significant time and resources to have our products considered and possibly selected by OEMs or Tier 1 suppliers for
use in a particular system, product or vehicle model, which is known as a series production win or a series production
award. In the case of ADAS technology, a series production award would mean that our lidar sensor and/or ADAS solution had been
selected for use in a particular vehicle model. However, if we are unable to achieve a series production award with respect to a particular
vehicle model, we may not have an opportunity to supply our products to the automotive OEM for that vehicle model for a period of many
years. In many cases, this period can be as long as five to seven or more years. If our products are not selected by an automotive OEM
or our suppliers for one vehicle model or if our products are not successful in that vehicle model,
it is unlikely that our product will be deployed in other vehicle models of that OEM. If we fail to win a significant number of vehicle
models from one or more automotive OEMs or their suppliers, our future business prospects, results of operations, and financial conditions
will be materially and adversely affected. 

The
complexity of our products and the limited visibility into the various environmental and other conditions under which potential customers
may use the products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses from undetected defects, errors or reliability issues in hardware
or software which could reduce the market adoption of our products, damage our reputation with prospective customers, expose us to product
liability and other claims, and adversely affect our operating costs. 

Our
products are highly technical and complex and require high standards to manufacture and may experience defects, errors or reliability
issues at various stages of development and production. We may be unable to timely manufacture or release products, or correct problems
that have arisen or correct such problems to the customer s satisfaction. Additionally, undetected errors, defects or security
vulnerabilities could result in serious injury to the end users or bystanders of technology incorporating our products, inability of
customers to commercialize technology incorporating our products, litigation against us, negative publicity and other consequences. These
risks are particularly prevalent in the highly competitive ADAS market. These problems may also result in claims, including class actions,
against us that could be costly to defend. Our reputation or brand may be damaged as a result of these problems and potential customers
may be reluctant to buy our products, which could adversely affect our financial results. 

34 

Adverse
conditions in the automotive industry or the global economy more generally could have adverse effects on our results of operations. 

While
we make our strategic planning decisions based on the assumption that the markets we are targeting will grow, our business is dependent,
in large part on, and directly affected by, business cycles and other factors affecting the global automobile industry and global economy
generally. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including
consumer spending and preferences, changes in interest rates and credit availability, consumer confidence, fuel costs, fuel availability,
environmental impact, governmental incentives and regulatory requirements, and political volatility, especially in energy-producing countries
and growth markets. In addition, automotive production and sales can be affected by our automotive OEM customers ability to continue
operating in response to challenging economic conditions and in response to labor relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements
and other factors. The volume of automotive production in North America, Europe and the rest of the world has fluctuated, sometimes significantly,
from year to year, and we expect such fluctuations to give rise to fluctuations in the demand for our products. Any significant adverse
change in any of these factors may result in a reduction in automotive sales and production by our automotive OEM customers and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Developments
in alternative technology may adversely affect the demand for our lidar technology. 

Significant
developments in alternative technologies, such as cameras and radar, may materially and adversely affect our business prospects in ways
we do not currently anticipate. Existing and other camera and radar technologies may emerge as OEMs preferred alternative to our
solution, which would result in the loss of competitiveness of our lidar solution. Our R D efforts may not be sufficient to adapt
to these changes in technology and our solution may not compete effectively with these alternative systems. 

ADAS
features may be delayed in adoption by OEMs, which would negatively impact our business prospects. 

The
ADAS market is fast evolving and there is generally a lack of an established regulatory framework. Vehicle regulators globally continue
to consider new and enhanced emissions requirements, including electrification, to meet environmental and economic needs as well as pursue
new safety standards to address emerging traffic risks. For instance, in May 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
published a new rule requiring automatic emergency braking systems in U.S. light vehicles and trucks by September 2029. To control new
vehicle prices, among other concerns, OEMs may need to dedicate technology and cost additions to new vehicle designs to meet these emissions
and safety requirements and postpone the consumer cost pressures of new ADAS features. As additional safety requirements are imposed
on vehicle manufacturers, our business prospects may be materially impacted. 

Because
the lidar and ADAS markets are rapidly evolving, it is difficult to forecast customer adoption rates, demand, and selling prices for
our products and solutions. 

We
are pursuing opportunities in rapidly evolving markets, including technological and regulatory changes, and it is difficult to predict
the timing and size of the opportunities. For example, lidar-based ADAS solutions require complex technology and because these automotive
systems depend on technology from many companies, commercialization of ADAS products could be delayed or impaired on account of certain
technological components of ours or others not being ready to be deployed in vehicles. In addition,
the selling prices we are able to ultimately charge in the future for the products we are currently developing may be less than what
we currently project. Our future financial performance will depend on our ability to make timely investments in the correct market opportunities.
If one or more of these markets experience a shift in prospective customer demand, our products may not compete as effectively, if at
all, and they may not be designed into commercialized products. Given the evolving nature of the markets in which we operate, it is difficult
to predict customer demand or adoption rates for our products, selling prices or the future growth of our target markets. If demand does
not develop or if we cannot accurately forecast it, the size of our markets, inventory requirements or future financial results will
be adversely affected. 

Because
lidar is new in the markets we are seeking to enter, our market forecasts may not materialize as anticipated. 

Our
market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that
may not materialize as anticipated. These estimates and forecasts relating to the expected size and growth of the markets for lidar-based
technology may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth we anticipate, we may not grow our business
at similar rates, or at all. Our future growth is subject to many factors, including market adoption of our products, which is subject
to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that these forecasts will not be materially inaccurate.

eligible to receive in connection with certain terminations of a qualifying Executive s employment with the Company, which will
supersede all other arrangement or understandings with respect to Executive s severance payments and benefits. Subject to the terms
of the Severance Plan, the Compensation Committee expects that Executive will be a Tier 1 participant in the Severance Plan for as long
as Executive serves as CEO. 

6.
 Parachute Payments . If any payment or benefit (including payments and benefits pursuant to this Agreement) that Executive
would receive in connection with an event which constitutes a change in ownership or control within the meaning of Section 280G of the
