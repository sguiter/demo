The Company reviews its investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. The Company does not intend to sell the securities and has the intent and ability to hold them for a period of time sufficient for recovery of their amortized cost basis. This review includes analyzing the extent to which the fair value has been lower than the cost, the market liquidity for the investment, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer, and the Company s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Management believes that the unrealized loss only represents temporary impairment of the securities, which are predominantly backed by credit of government agencies, and are a result of the increased market interest rates since the time of purchase, and not the credit quality of the issuer. As such, allowance for credit losses was required on securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Of the remaining thousand in loans individually evaluated for credit losses , an aggregate valuation allowance of thousand was required to reflect what was determined to be a shortfall in the value of the collateral as compared to the balance on such loans. Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure are to be sold and are carried at fair value less estimated cost to sell. Fair value is based upon independent market prices or appraised value of the property. These assets would be included in Level 3 fair value based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company had real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure.

OVERVIEW The Company is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in 2008 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act ). The Company was formed for purposes of acquiring Embassy Bank For The Lehigh Valley (the Bank in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company structure, which was consummated on November 11, 2008. Accordingly, the Company owns all of the capital stock of the Bank, giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the Company continues to grow. Embassy Holdings, LLC (the LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank organized to engage in the holding of property acquired by the Bank in satisfaction of debts previously contracted. As such, the consolidated financial statements contained herein include the accounts of the Company, the Bank and the LLC. The Bank, which is the Company s primary operating subsidiary, was originally incorporated as a Pennsylvania bank on May 11, 2001 and opened its doors on November 6, 2001. It was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, the Bank s primary market area, for the purpose of providing a local community bank to serve Lehigh and Northampton Counties in Pennsylvania. Since its inception, the Board s philosophy has been that, by running the Bank with a view toward the long term, only good things will happen for the Bank s customers, team members, shareholders and the Lehigh Valley community. At September 30, 2024, the Company continued to be in a strong financial and operational condition. The Bank s September 30, 2024 capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in applicable banking regulations. The Company s ratio of non-performing loans to total loans at September 30, 2024 was 0.10 and the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets was 0.07 . The Company had its last Community Reinvestment Act CRA examination in 2022 and received a satisfactory rating. The Company s assets increased by 58.7 million from 1.66 billion at December 31, 2023 to 1.72 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase was due to a 13.0 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of 32.0 million in securities available for sale, an increase of 4.9 million in net loans receivable, and an increase of 9.9 million in bank owned life insurance. The 13.0 million increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to an increase in deposits of 58.9 million, an increase in securities sold under agreement to repurchase of 3.0 million, 17.6 million in principal pay downs on mortgage-backed securities and maturities within the 

 29 

securities available for sale portfolio, offset by a decrease in short term borrowings of 13.1 million, the net loan growth of 4.9 million, the purchase of 44.3 million in securities available for sale, and the purchase of 9.0 million of bank owned life insurance policies in the first quarter of 2024. The 32.0 million increase in securities was net of a decrease in unrealized losses of 4.8 million. The current unrealized loss position of the securities portfolio is due to the increase in market interest rates in response to economic conditions since purchase and not due to the credit quality of the investment portfolio. The Company's deposits increased by 58.9 million from 1.48 billion at December 31, 2023 to 1.54 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase in deposits was due to a 1.9 million increase in non-interest bearing deposits and an increase of 57.0 million in interest bearing deposits. The Company continues to seek deposits using a highly effective relationship building, sales and marketing effort, which serves to further increase the Company s overall presence in the market it serves, along with deposit relationships developed as a result of cross-marketing efforts to its loan and other non-depository banking service customers. The Company s success in attracting new deposit relationships is, in part, due to the increased usage of the Company s online banking platform, competitively offered rates, and the continued convenience and efficiency of our branch network and branch personnel. The Company continues to take advantage of deposit opportunities created by mergers, name changes, competitive branch hour and service adjustments and/or closures in the Company s market area, and by attracting new customers looking to relocate to a local, reputable community bank. Net loans receivable increased by 4.9 million to 1.25 billion at September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.24 billion at December 31, 2023. The market continues to be very competitive and the Company is committed to maintaining a high-quality portfolio that returns a reasonable market rate. While the past and current economic and competitive conditions in the marketplace have created more competition for loans to creditworthy customers, the Company continues to expand its market presence and pipeline, and continues to focus on developing a reputation as being a market leader in both commercial and consumer/mortgage lending. Management believes that this combination of relationship building, cross marketing and responsible underwriting will translate into continued long-term growth of a portfolio of quality loans and core deposit relationships. The Company continues to monitor the interest rate exposure of its interest-bearing assets and liabilities. See the expanded discussion under the Financial Condition: Loans section below. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.7 million compared to net income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 3.0 million, a decrease of 288 thousand, or 9.6 . Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased to 0.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.39 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The difference in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from an increase in interest expense of 2.6 million, or 51.6 , due to the rate environment, as well as a slight increase in non-interest expense and a decrease in the credit for credit losses; offset by a 2.4 million increase in interest income and an increase in non-interest income. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.7 million compared to net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 9.8 million, a decrease of 2.1 million, or 21.3 . Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased to 1.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from an increase in interest expense of 9.2 million, or 76.1 , due to the rate environment; offset by a 5.7 million increase in interest income, an increase in non-interest income, a slight decrease in non-interest expenses, and an increase in the credit for credit losses. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Interest Income The Company determines interest rate spread and margin on both a US GAAP and tax equivalent basis. The use of tax equivalent basis in determining interest rate spread and margin is considered a non-US GAAP measure. The Company believes the use of this measure provides meaningful information to the reader of the consolidated financial statements when comparing taxable and nontaxable assets. However, it is supplemental to US GAAP which is used to prepare the Company s consolidated financial statements and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for US GAAP measures. In addition, the non-US GAAP measure may not be comparable to non-US GAAP measures reported by other companies. The tax rate used to calculate the tax equivalent adjustments was 21 for 2024 and 2023. Total interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.4 million to 16.9 million, as compared to 14.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average earning assets were 1.63 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.57 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The tax equivalent yield on average earning assets was 4.16 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.71 for the third quarter of 2023. Total interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.6 million to 7.8 million, as compared to 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average interest bearing liabilities were 1.23 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.18 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on average interest bearing liabilities was 2.51 and 1.72 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

 30 

Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.2 million, compared to 9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income is, in part, the result of a decrease in the average balance of taxable investments, an increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit, an increase in the average balance of NOW and money markets, and an increase in the average balances of securities under agreement to repurchase, along with a decrease in the rate of non-taxable investments and an increase in the rates of interest bearing demand deposits, NOW, money market, savings, certificates of deposit, and securities under agreements to repurchase. The decrease in net interest income was offset by an increase in the average balances of taxable and non-taxable loans, an increase in the average balances of interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold, along with an increase in the rates of taxable and non-taxable loans, taxable investments, federal funds sold, and interest bearing deposits with banks. Also offsetting the decrease in net interest income was a decrease in the average balance of savings and a decrease in the balance and rate of FHLB short term borrowings. The Company s net interest margin is 2.24 on a US GAAP basis and 2.27 on a tax equivalent (non-US GAAP) basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.38 on a US GAAP basis and 2.42 on a tax equivalent (non-US GAAP) basis for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.7 million to 48.1 million, as compared to 42.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average earning assets were 1.60 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.57 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tax equivalent yield on average earning assets was 4.07 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.64 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9.2 million to 21.4 million, as compared to 12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average interest bearing liabilities were 1.20 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.17 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on average interest bearing liabilities was 2.38 and 1.39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.8 million, compared to 30.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income is, in part, the result of a decrease in the average balance of taxable investments and non-taxable investments, an increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit, an increase in the average balance of NOW and money markets, and an increase in the average balances of securities under agreement to repurchase, along with a decrease in the rate of non-taxable investments and an increase in the rates of interest bearing demand deposits, NOW, money market, savings, certificates of deposit, and securities under agreements to repurchase. The decrease in net interest income was offset by an increase in the average balances of taxable and non-taxable loans, an increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits with banks, along with an increase in the rate of taxable and non-taxable loans, taxable investments, federal funds sold, and interest bearing deposits with banks. Also offsetting the decrease in net interest income was a decrease in the average balance of savings and a decrease in the balance and rate of FHLB short term borrowings. The Company s net interest margin is 2.24 on a US GAAP basis and 2.28 on a tax equivalent (non-US GAAP) basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.58 on a US GAAP basis and 2.61 on a tax equivalent (non-US GAAP) basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Provision for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments The Company adopted ASC Topic 326 on January 1 , 2023 , and applied the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, as of January 1, 2023 (i.e., modified retrospective approach). Upon adoption of the standard, the Company recorded a 188 thousand increase to the allowance for credit losses, which resulted in a 148 thousand after-tax decrease to retained earnings as of January 1, 2023. The tax effect resulted in a 40 thousand increase to deferred tax assets. The allowance for credit losses is established through provisions for credit losses charged against income. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The measurement of expected credit losses also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures such as loan commitments and unused lines of credit. The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level management considers to be adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated over the expected life of the loans. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current and forecasted economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance consists of a collectively evaluated component and an individually evaluated component. The collectively evaluated component covers non-classified loans and classified loans not considered loans individually evaluated for credit losses, and is based 

 34 

on historical loss experience adjusted for forecasting factors and qualitative factors. The individually evaluated component relates to loans that are classified as loans individually evaluated for credit losses and/or restructured. For loans that are classified as loans individually evaluated for credit losses, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the loans individually evaluated for credit losses is lower than the carrying value of that loan. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the credit for credit losses on loans was 40 thousand and the provision for credit losses on unused commitments was 10 thousand, compared to credit for credit losses of 300 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no charge-offs and no recoveries. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, there were no charge-offs and recoveries of 1 thousand. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the credit for credit losses on loans was 484 thousand and the provision for credit losses on unused commitments was 99 thousand, compared to credit for credit losses of 190 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were charge-offs of 11 thousand and recoveries of 240 thousand. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no charge-offs and recoveries of 2 thousand. The (credit) provision for credit losses is a function of the allowance for credit loss methodology that the Company uses to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for inherent credit losses after net charge-offs have been deducted. See the discussion below under Credit Risk and Loan Quality regarding the Company s considerations of its September 30, 2024 allowance for credit loss levels. The allowance for credit losses is 12.2 million as of September 30, 2024, which is 0.97 of total loans receivable, compared to 12.4 million or 1.00 of total loans receivable as of September 30, 2023. At December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was 12.5 million, which represented 0.99 of total loans receivable. Based principally on loan growth, economic conditions, asset quality, and loan-loss experience, including that of comparable institutions in the Company s market area, the allowance is believed to be adequate to absorb any losses expected in the portfolio. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for credit losses is adequate, or that material increases will not be necessary should the quality of the loans deteriorate. The Company has not participated in any sub-prime lending activity. The activity in the allowance for credit losses is shown in the following table, as well as period end loans receivable and the allowance for credit losses as a percent of the total loans receivable portfolio: 3 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In Thousands) Loans receivable at end of period 1,258,084 1,249,289 1,258,084 1,249,289 Allowance for credit losses: Balance, beginning 12,246 12,748 12,461 12,449 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle - - - 188 Credit for credit losses (40) (300) (484) (190) Loans charged off: Commercial real estate - - - - Commercial construction - - - - Commercial - - - - Residential real estate - - - - Consumer - - (11) - Total loans charged off - - (11) - Recoveries of loans previously charged off: Commercial real estate - - 240 - Commercial construction - - - - Commercial - - - - Residential real estate - 1 - 2 Consumer - - - - Total recoveries - 1 240 2 Net recoveries - 1 229 2 Balance at end of period 12,206 12,449 12,206 12,449 Allowance for credit losses to loans receivable at end of period 0.97 1.00 0.97 1.00 
 In addition to the allowance for credit losses, the Company maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb probable losses. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a 99 thousand compared to zero 

 35 

unfunded commitment reserve was reported, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other liabilities and reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income in credit for credit losses. Non-interest Income Total non-interest income was 853 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 570 thousand for the same period in 2023. The increase is, in part, attributable to an increase in bank owned life insurance of 261 thousand primarily due to the purchase of 9.0 million of new bank owned life insurance policies and the conversion of 2.0 million in previous BOLI policies to higher yielding BOLI products through a 1035 exchange transaction in the first quarter of 2024. Also, contributing to the increase in non-interest income was an increase of 11 thousand in debit card interchange fees and an increase of 18 thousand in other service fees. Offsetting this increase is a decrease in merchant and credit card processing fees of 7 thousand. Total non-interest income was 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is, in part, attributable to an increase in bank owned life insurance of 395 thousand primarily due to the purchase of 9.0 million of new bank owned life insurance policies and the conversion of 2.0 million in previous BOLI policies to higher yielding BOLI products through a 1035 exchange transaction in the first quarter of 2024. Offsetting this increase is a decrease in merchant and credit card processing fees of 26 thousand. Non-interest Expense Non-interest expenses increased 207 thousand from 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in non-interest expenses is, in part, attributable to a 184 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to annual increases in salaries, new hires, and an increase in health insurance cost, offset by a decrease in stock grant expense and a decrease in non-qualified pension expense. The Company had a 7.5 increase in full-time equivalent employees from one hundred seven (107) at September 30, 2023 to one hundred fifteen (115) at September 30, 2024. New hires included various branch and operational personnel. Additional increases in non-interest expenses are attributable to an increase of 22 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense and an increase of 52 thousand in other expenses primarily due to an increase in bank shares tax. The increases in non-interest expenses were offset, in part, by a decrease of 22 thousand in advertising and promotion expense and a 27 thousand decrease in professional fees. The Company s efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, was 67.9 and 66.2 for the three months ending September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Non-interest expenses decreased 145 thousand from 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 20.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in non-interest expenses is, in part, attributable to a 207 thousand decrease in salaries and employee benefits due to decreases in health insurance cost, stock grant expense, incentive and bonuses expense, temporary agency services expense, and non-qualified pension expense, as well as an increase in deferred loan costs, offset by an increase in team compensation due to annual increases in salaries and an increase in the number of employees. Additional decreases in non-interest expenses are attributable to a decrease of 199 thousand in advertising and promotion expense and a decrease of 100 thousand in data processing expense due to credits applied during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a decrease in escrow management services due to implementation costs of transitioning to a new vendor in 2023, offset by an increase in data processing maintenance contracts and an increase in network support expense. The decreases in non-interest expenses were offset, in part, by an increase of 138 thousand in occupancy and equipment expense and an increase of 181 thousand in other expenses due, in part, to increases in bank shares tax, losses from check fraud, cash over and short, shareholder relations and other operating expenses, offset by decreases in dispute and fraud losses on debit cards and wire fraud losses. The Company s efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, was 69.5 and 63.2 for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A breakdown of other expenses can be found in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 531 thousand, or 16.4 of income before taxes, compared to income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2023 totaling 667 thousand, or 18.2 of income before taxes. The decrease in the tax rate is, in part, the result of an increase in income on bank owned life insurance and the result of the change in the mix of taxable and tax free loans and investments. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1.5 million, or 16.4 of income before taxes, compared to income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaling 2.2 million, or 18.2 of income before taxes. The decrease in the tax rate is, in part, the result of an increase in income on bank owned life insurance and the result of the change in the mix of taxable and tax free loans and investments.

FINANCIAL CONDITION Securities The Company s securities portfolio continues to be classified, in its entirety, as available for sale. Management believes that a portfolio classification of available for sale allows complete flexibility in the investment portfolio. Using this classification, the Company intends to hold these securities for an indefinite amount of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Such securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. The portfolio is structured to provide a return on investments while providing a consistent source of liquidity and meeting strict risk standards. Investment securities consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities issued by FHLMC or FNMA, taxable and non-taxable municipal bonds, government agency bonds, and Treasury bonds. The Company holds no high-risk or direct internationally exposed securities or derivatives as of September 30, 2024. The Company has not made any investments in non-U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities or sub-prime loans. The current liquidity of the portfolio has been impacted by the increase in market interest rates. Selling of securities would not be expected as a primary source of short term liquidity given the unrealized losses currently in the portfolio. Total securities at September 30, 2024 were 308.1 million compared to 276.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the investment portfolio resulted from the purchase of seven (7) Treasury bonds and three (3) government agency bonds totaling 44.3 million and a decrease in unrealized losses of 4.8 million, offset by principal pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, the maturity of one (1) non-taxable municipal bond, and the maturity of two (2) Treasury bonds totaling 17.6 million. The carrying value of the securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024 includes a net unrealized loss of 50.5 million, which is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity net of income tax effect. This compares to a net unrealized loss of 55.3 million at December 31, 2023. The current unrealized loss position of the securities portfolio is due to increasing market interest rates in 2022 through 2023 in response to economic conditions since initial purchase. Management determined the Company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell, securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024. Further, management reviewed the Company's securities as of September 30, 2024 and concluded there were no credit-related declines in fair value. The effective duration of the securities portfolio remains approximately 6 to 7 years at September 30, 2024. Loans The loan portfolio comprises a major component of the Company s earning assets. All of the Company s loans are to domestic borrowers. Total net loans receivable increased by 4.9 million to 1.25 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.24 billion at December 31, 2023. The gross loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 82 at September 30, 2024, compared to 85 at December 31, 2023. The Company s loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 was comprised of residential real estate and consumer loans of 667.0 million, an increase of 3.3 million from December 31, 2023, and commercial loans of 591.1 million, an increase of 1.3 million from December 31, 2023. The Company has not originated, nor does it intend to originate, sub-prime mortgage loans. Credit Risk and Loan Quality The Company s allowance for credit losses decreased 255 thousand to 12.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 12.5 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses represented 0.97 and 0.99 of total loans receivable, respectively. The Company s non-performing loans to total loans receivable were 0.10 at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.03 at September 30, 2023, and 0.03 at December 31, 2023. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no charge-offs and no recoveries. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, there were no charge-offs and recoveries of 1 thousand. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were charge-offs of 11 thousand and 240 thousand of recoveries. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no charge-offs and recoveries of 2 thousand. The aggregate balances on non-performing loans are included in the following table. At September 30, 2024, approximately 95 of the Company s loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate. Our loan portfolio includes a large amount of commercial real estate loans. Management believes the commercial real estate loan portfolio is well-diversified. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, high volatility commercial real estate exposures were 10.0 million and 7.4 million, respectively. Commercial real estate loans are originated primarily within Lehigh and Northampton counties, are within the Company s underwriting criteria, and generally include the guarantee of one or more of the borrowers affiliates. At September 30, 2024, the Company s office space portfolio included no exposure to properties in major metropolitan markets. Commercial real estate loans have drawn the attention of the regulators in recent years as a potential source of risk. The Company monitors these types of loans closely, obtaining updated appraisals on loans when required. As detailed in the Allowance for Credit Losses table, the Company had no charge-offs in this category in 2024 or 2023. The Company believes it has taken the appropriate steps to implement appropriate risk management practices for its commercial real estate loan portfolio, which are subject to regulatory examination.

The details for non-performing loans and assets are included in the following table: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 (In Thousands) Non-accrual - commercial 664 - - Non-accrual - consumer 544 366 297 Loans past due 90 or more days, accruing interest - - 73 Total nonperforming loans 1,208 366 370 Foreclosed assets - - - Total nonperforming assets 1,208 366 370 Nonperforming loans to total loans 0.10 0.03 0.03 Nonperforming assets to total assets 0.07 0.02 0.02 Non-accrual loans to total loans 0.10 0.03 0.02 Allowance to non-accrual loans 1010.43 3404.64 4191.58 Net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans 0.00 0.00 0.00 
 Premises and Equipment Company premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, decreased 323 thousand from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. This decrease is due to depreciation on existing premises and equipment, offset by new purchases. Deposits Total deposits at September 30, 2024 increased by 58.9 million to 1.54 billion from 1.48 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in the Company s deposits was due to an increase of 29.6 million in demand, NOW and money market deposits and an increase of 76.6 million in time deposits, offset by a 47.2 million decrease in savings deposits. The slight shift from savings to time deposits is primarily due to higher yielding rates on time deposits, due to competitive pressure and the current rate environment. Included in the above mentioned increase was a 21.6 million increase in non-interest bearing demand business deposits, offset by a 19.7 million decrease in non-interest bearing demand personal deposits. Included in total deposits at September 30, 2024 were personal deposits of 1.08 billion, business deposits of 361.9 million, and municipal deposits of 94.8 million. Included in total deposits at December 31, 2023 were personal deposits of 1.09 billion, business deposits of 293.6 million, and municipal deposits of 89.5 million. The estimated amount of uninsured assessable deposits, including related interest accrued and unpaid, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 501.2 million and 464.3 million, respectively. Liquidity Liquidity represents the Company s ability to meet the demands required for the funding of loans and to meet depositors requirements for use of their funds. The Company s sources of liquidity are cash balances, due from banks, and federal funds sold. Cash and cash equivalents were 91.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 78.9 million at December 31, 2023. Additional asset liquidity sources include principal and interest payments from the investment security and loan portfolios. Long-term liquidity needs may be met by selling unpledged securities available for sale, selling or participating loans, or raising additional capital. As noted above, selling of securities would not be a primary source of short term liquidity given the unrealized losses currently in the portfolio. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 308.1 million of available for sale securities. Securities with a carrying value of 163.9 million and 145.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were subject to agreements to repurchase, pledged to secure public deposits, or pledged for other purposes required or permitted by law. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity for short-term and long-term FHLB advances of approximately 686.8 million, of which 664.8 million is available for borrowing at September 30, 2024. This borrowing capacity with the FHLB includes a line of credit of 150.0 million. The Bank had an outstanding FHLB letter of credit in the amount of 160 thousand as of September 30, 2024. There were 21.9 million FHLB short-term advances outstanding as of September 30, 2024 with an interest rate of 5.239 , which matured and was repaid on October 1, 2024. The Company had no long-term FHLB advances outstanding as of September 30, 2024. There were 35.0 million short-term FHLB advances outstanding and no long-term FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2023. All FHLB borrowings are secured by qualifying assets of the Bank. The Bank has a federal funds line of credit with the ACBB of 10.0 million, of which none was outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Advances from this line are unsecured. The Bank is also eligible to borrow under the Federal Reserve Bank s discount window borrowing programs. 

 38 

The Company has a revolving line of credit facility with the ACBB of 7.5 million, of which none was outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Advances from this line are unsecured. This line of credit was extended until October 2025 in October 2024. The Bank is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services (CDARS) program and the Insured Cash Sweep (ICS) program offered by Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. CDARS is a funding and liquidity management tool used by banks to access funds and manage their balance sheet. ICS provides liquidity similar to a money market or savings account. Both programs enable financial institutions to provide customers with full FDIC insurance on deposits over 250 thousand that are placed in the program. The Bank also has access to other brokered deposits as a source of liquidity. Because of the composition of the Company s balance sheet, its strong capital base, ability to attract new deposit relationships, access to brokered deposits, and borrowing capacity, the Company believes that it remains well positioned with respect to liquidity. The majority of the Company s funds are invested in loans with a portion invested in investment securities that generally carry a lower yield. While it is desirable to be liquid, it has the effect of a lower interest margin. The Company has no investment in or financial relationship with any unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or capital resources. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company s consolidated financial statements do not reflect the various off-balance sheet arrangements that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. These off-balance sheet arrangements consist of unfunded loans and commitments, as well as lines of credit made under the same standards as on-balance sheet instruments. These unused commitments totaled 173.4 million and 182.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 there was a 99 thousand allowance for credit losses required for off-balance sheet arrangements and no allowance amount at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of 8.7 million and 9.0 million, respectively. Because these instruments have fixed maturity dates, and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon, they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to the Company. Management is of the opinion that the Company s liquidity is sufficient to meet its anticipated needs. Capital Resources and Adequacy Total stockholders equity was 114.5 million as of September 30, 2024, representing a net increase of 8.8 million from December 31, 2023. The increase in capital was the result of net income of 7.7 million, an increase in common stock of 23 thousand, an increase in surplus of 490 thousand due to employee stock purchases and stock grants with compensation expense, and a decrease of 3.8 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offset by dividends paid of 3.2 million. The accumulated other comprehensive losses are excluded from both the Bank s and the Company s Tier 1 regulatory capital calculations. The Company s tangible book value per share, calculated as total stockholders equity divided by outstanding common stock shares, was 15.03 and 13.91 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s tangible book value per share not including accumulated other comprehensive loss in the total stockholders equity numerator (a non-GAAP measure) was 20.27 and 19.66 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company believes this non-GAAP measurement enhances the overall understanding of Company performance and increases comparability of period to period results, but should not be viewed as a substitute for the measure as determined in accordance with GAAP or an inference that future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to be determined in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents the computation of this non-GAAP based measure shown together with its most directly comparable GAAP measure: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars In Thousands Except Per Share Data) Tangible Book Value Per Share Total stockholders' equity 114,494 105,655 Addback: accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL") 39,917 43,700 Total stockholders' equity not included AOCL (non-GAAP) 154,411 149,355 Common stock shares outstanding 7,618,715 7,596,236 Book value per share (most directly comparable GAAP based measure) 15.03 13.91 AOCL per share 5.24 5.75 Book value per share not including AOCL (non-GAAP) 20.27 19.66

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. The regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined in the regulations), and Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined in the regulations). As of September 30, 2024, the Bank met the minimum requirements. In addition, the Bank s capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations. The following table provides a comparison of the Bank s risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios: Consolidated Bank September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars In Thousands) Tier 1, common stockholders' equity 154,171 149,299 Tier 2, allowable portion of allowance for credit losses 12,305 12,461 Total capital 166,476 161,760 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 13.6 13.3 Tier 1 risk based capital ratio 13.6 13.3 Total risk based capital ratio 14.7 14.5 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.8 8.9 
 Note: Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are excluded from regulatory capital components of risk-based capital and leverage ratios. In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3 for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4 . The capital ratios to be considered well capitalized under the capital rules are: Common equity of 6.5 ; Tier 1 leverage of 5 ; Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8 ; and Total risk-based capital of 10 . The Company qualifies as a small bank holding company and is not subject to the Federal Reserve s consolidated capital rules, although an institution that so qualifies may continue to file reports that include such capital amounts and ratios. The Company has elected to continue to report those amounts and ratios.

The following table provides the Company s risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios: Consolidated Corporation September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars In Thousands) Tier 1, common stockholders' equity 154,411 149,355 Tier 2, allowable portion of allowance for credit losses 12,305 12,461 Total capital 166,716 161,816 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 13.7 13.3 Tier 1 risk based capital ratio 13.7 13.3 Total risk based capital ratio 14.8 14.5 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.9 8.9 
 Note: Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are excluded from regulatory capital components of risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company s primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. A principal objective of the Company s asset/liability management policy is to minimize the Company s exposure to changes in interest rates by an ongoing review of the maturity and repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO), included as part of the Board of Directors meetings, oversees this review, which establishes policies to control interest rate sensitivity. Interest rate sensitivity is the volatility of a company s earnings resulting from a movement in market interest rates. The Company monitors rate sensitivity in order to reduce vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate capital levels and acceptable levels of liquidity. Beginning in 2022 through 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate in an attempt to tame inflation. Conversely, in September 2024 the Federal Reserve decreased its key interest rate by 50 basis points and in November 2024 by 25 basis points. The Company s asset/liability management policy, monthly and quarterly financial reports, along with simulation modeling, supplies management with guidelines to evaluate and manage rate sensitivity. Because income simulations assume that the Company s balance sheet will remain static over the simulation horizon, the results do not reflect adjustments in strategy that management could implement in response to rate shifts. Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel. Based on a twelve-month forecast of the balance sheet, the following table sets forth the Company s interest rate risk profile at September 30, 2024. For income simulation purposes, personal and business savings accounts reprice every two months, personal and business NOW accounts reprice every two months and personal, and business money market accounts reprice every month. Management reviews all assumptions on a periodic basis and believes current assumptions support market conditions. The impact on net interest income, illustrated in the following table, would vary if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by the assumptions. Change in Interest Rates Percentage Change in Net Interest Income Down 100 basis points 1.6 Down 200 basis points 2.5 Up 100 basis points -2.8 Up 200 basis points -6.9
