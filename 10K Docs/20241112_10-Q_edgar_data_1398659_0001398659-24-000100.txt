 Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized. 
 In business combinations where the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased exceeds the cost of the acquired business, the Company recognizes the resulting gain under Other operating (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of income. 
 The Company also capitalizes certain software and technology-related development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software or technology for sale/lease to customers when the initial design phase is completed and commercial and technological feasibility has been established. Any development cost incurred before technological feasibility is established is expensed as incurred as research and development costs. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detailed design program or, in its absence, completion of a working model. Capitalized software and technology costs include only (i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining software and technology and (ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the project. 
 Costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software or technology for sale/lease to customers which are under development and not put to use are disclosed under intangible assets under development. Advances paid towards the acquisition of intangible assets outstanding as of each balance sheet date are disclosed under intangible assets under development. 
 Capitalized software and technology costs are included in intangible assets under technology-related intangible assets on the Company s balance sheet and are amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software and technology. 
 The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of intangible assets that are being amortized at each reporting period wherever events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization, and the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.

The Company considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal or termination option. After the commencement date, the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within the Company s control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew or terminate.

During the year ended December 31 2023, the Company did not receive any earn-out consideration under the stock purchase agreement as the earn-out events were not achieved. Accordingly, the Company did not record any income from earn-out consideration. 
 
 Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement signed in 2022 related to the sale of the Business, the Company held a fixed rate unsecured loan note amounting to issued by the buyer group. The Company's obligation to transfer to the buyer group in exchange for the note was satisfied in February 2023 upon the closing of the transaction. The note and interest thereon were to become receivable by the Company upon a future share sale, disposal or listing by the buyer group or early voluntary repayment of the note at the discretion of the buyer group. The Company previously deemed the likelihood of recovery of principal and interest on the note to be remote and not in the control of the Company.

 All of the Company's segments include revenue from both Data-Tech-AI and Digital Operations services. See Note 18 for additional information. 
 
 Contract balances 
 Contract assets represent the contract acquisition fees or other upfront fees paid to a customer. Such costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit and recorded as an adjustment to the transaction price and deducted from revenue. The Company s assessment did not indicate any significant impairment losses on its contract assets for the periods presented. 
 
 Contract liabilities include that portion of revenue for which payments have been received in advance from customers. The Company also defers revenues attributable to certain process transition activities for which costs have been capitalized by the Company as contract fulfillment costs. Consideration received from customers, if any, relating to such transition activities is also included as part of contract liabilities. The contract liabilities are included within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Other liabilities in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The revenues are recognized as (or when) the performance obligation is fulfilled under the contract with the customer.

 Bank guarantees 
 
 The Company has outstanding bank guarantees and letters of credit amounting to and as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. Bank guarantees are generally provided to government agencies or for leases. These guarantees may be revoked if the beneficiary suffers any losses or damages through the breach of any of the covenants contained in the agreements governing such guarantees. 
 
 Other commitments 
 
 Certain units of the Company s Indian subsidiaries are established as Software Technology Parks of India units or Special Economic Zone SEZ units under the relevant regulations issued by the Government of India. These units are exempt from customs and other duties on imported and indigenous capital goods, stores and spares. SEZ units are also exempt from the Indian Goods and Services Tax that was introduced in India in 2017. The Company has undertaken to pay taxes and duties, if any, in respect of capital goods, stores, spares and services consumed duty-free, in the event that certain terms and conditions are not fulfilled. 
 
 Contingency 
 
 (a) In February 2019, there was a judicial pronouncement in India with respect to defined contribution benefit payments interpreting certain statutory defined contribution obligations of employees and employers. If applied retrospectively, the interpretation would result in an increase in contributions payable by the Company for past periods for certain of its India-based employees. Due to a lack of interpretive guidance and based on legal advice the Company has obtained on the matter, it is currently impracticable to reliably estimate the timing and amount of any payments the Company may be required to make. Accordingly, the Company will await further clarity to evaluate the amount of a potential provision, if any. 
 
 (b) The Indian taxing authorities ("ITA") have issued assessment orders to certain subsidiaries of the Company seeking to assess income tax on certain transactions that occurred in 2015. The Company has received demands for potential tax claims related to these orders in an aggregate amount of , including interest through the date of the orders. This amount excludes penalties or interest accrued since the date of the orders. The Company is pursuing appeals before the relevant appellate authorities in respect of these orders. Further, in respect of a 2015 transaction, the ITA has attempted to revise a previously closed assessment. During 2022, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal of India (the "Tribunal") ruled in favor of the Company denying the ITA's ability to revise the assessment, and the ITA have appealed this ruling before the Delhi High Court. In January 2023, notwithstanding the Tribunal s decision in the Company's favor, the ITA issued a revised assessment order to the Company, and in March 2023, this assessment order was struck down by the Tribunal. The ITA have filed an appeal challenging this most recent decision of the Tribunal before the Delhi High Court. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the Company s position will ultimately prevail in respect of these transactions. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefit has been provided with respect to this matter as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 (c) In September 2020, the Indian Parliament approved new labor codes, including the Code on Social Security, 2020 (the Code ), which will impact the Company s contributions to its defined benefit plans for employees based in India. The Code has not yet been made effective, and the rules for different states are in the process of being framed. The Company has carried out a preliminary evaluation of the impact the Code will have on the Company. The final impact will be assessed after the Code becomes effective and the related rules are published.

Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable at the time they are made, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties, and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this filing to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 
 
 Macroeconomic environment 
 
 Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. In the third quarter of 2024, continued economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, including with respect to monetary policy and slowing global economic growth, impacted our business and may continue to impact our business in the future. 
 
 The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and actions taken by the United States and other countries in response, including the imposition of sanctions, as well as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, have contributed to and may continue to exacerbate supply chain disruption and inflation, regional instability and geopolitical tensions. While we do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine, it is difficult to anticipate the future impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business or our clients businesses. We have limited operations in Israel and continue to closely monitor the situation in the Middle East. To date, we do not believe the conflicts in Ukraine or the Middle East, or the economic or political impacts of these conflicts, have had a material impact on our business, financial position or operations, but we plan to continue to monitor both conflicts. 
 For additional information about the risks we face, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 1 We disaggregate our revenue as revenue from either Digital Operations services or Data-Tech-AI services based on the nature of the services provided. During the first quarter of 2024, we realigned as Data-Tech-AI services certain services that had previously been designated as Digital Operations services based on the nature of work performed and the mode of delivery for these particular services, which have evolved over time. Accordingly, we have updated the classification of revenue derived from Digital Operations services and Data-Tech-AI services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to present comparable information. For additional information, see Note 19 Net revenues under Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements above.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net revenues. Our net revenues were 1,210.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 75.2 million, or 6.6 , from 1,135.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Adjusted for foreign exchange, primarily the impact of changes in the values of the Argentine peso, Japanese yen and Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, our net revenues grew 7.0 in t he third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 on a constant currency 2 basis. We provide information about our revenue growth on a constant currency 2 basis so that our revenue may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Net revenues on a constant currency 2 basis are calculated by restating current-period activity using the prior fiscal period s foreign currency exchange rates and adjusted for hedging gains/losses. 
 Our average headcount increased b y 9.1 to approximately 137,500 i n the third quarter of 2024 from approximately 126,000 in the third quarter of 2023.

 Net revenues from Data-Tech-AI services in the third quarter of 2024 were 569.4 million, up 46.1 million, or 8.8 , from 523.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. This increase was largely driven by an increase in revenue from our AI and advanced tech services as well as data and analytics services in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Net revenues from Digital Operations services in the third quarter of 2024 were 641.5 million, up 29.1 million, or 4.8 , from 612.4 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to ramp-ups of services from recently signed large deals. 
 Revenues by segment were as follows:

2 Revenue growth on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated by restating current-period activity using the prior fiscal period s foreign currency exchange rates adjusted for hedging gains/losses in such period. 
 55 

Net revenues from our Financial Services segment increased by 5.8 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, largely due to an increase in AI and advanced tech services as well as data and analytics services. Net revenues from our Consumer and Healthcare segment increased by 8.2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, largely driven by ramp-ups of services from recently signed large deals and an increase in data and analytics services. Net revenues from our High Tech and Manufacturing segment increased by 5.8 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, largely driven by ramp-ups of deals signed in 2023 as well as recently signed deals and an increase in AI and advanced tech services. 
 
 Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue was 779.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 46.5 million, or 6.4 , from 733.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in cost of revenue in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to (i) an increase in our operational headcount to support revenue growth, (ii) wage inflation, (iii) increased spending on professional services and (iv) higher infrastructure expenses. This increase was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 . 
 
 Gross margin. Our gross margin increased from 35.5 in the third quarter of 2023 to 35.6 in the third quarter of 2024 . The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by revenue growth and lower stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in our operational headcount and wage inflation, net of contractual cost-of-living-adjustments ("COLA"), in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses. SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased from 20.2 in the third quarter of 2023 to 20.1 in the third quarter of 2024. SG A expenses were 243.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 13.6 million, or 5.9 , from 229.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in SG A expenses was primarily due to an increase in our sales and marketing spend to support growth as well as higher travel related expenses and wage inflation in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense and operating leverage in support functions in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 . 
 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets was 6.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 1.0 million, or 13.4 , from 7.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the completion of useful lives of intangible assets acquired in prior periods. 
 Other operating (income) expense, net. Other operating income (net of expense) was 0.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, consistent with 0.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Income from operations. As a result of the foregoing factors, income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased from 14.6 in the third quarter of 2023 to 15.0 in the third quarter of 2024. Income from operations increased by 16.0 million from 165.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 181.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross margin, partially offset by higher SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Foreign exchange gains, net. We recorded a net foreign exchange gain of 1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net foreign exchange gain of 3.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The gain in the third quarter of 2023 and 2024 resulted primarily from the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar. 
 
 Interest income (expense), net . Our interest expense (net of interest income) was 12.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 0.9 million from 13.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a 5.7 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a 4.9 million increase in interest expense. Our interest income increased from 4.6 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 10.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher cash balances in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in interest expense was largely due to an incremental interest expense on the senior notes issued in June 2024 and lower gains on interest rate swaps entered into to hedge interest rate exposure on our term loan. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower interest expense on our revolving credit facility and term loan due to lower volumes in the third quarter of 2024 compared to third quarter of 2023. The weighted average rate of interest on our debt, including the net impact of interest rate swaps, increased from 4.1 in the third quarter of 2023 to 4.6 in the third quarter of 2024. See the section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Condition for further discussion. 
 
 Other income (expense), net. Our other i ncome (net of expense) was 5.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to other expense (net of income) of 0.5 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to a gain on changes in the fair value of assets in our deferred compensation plan in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a corresponding loss in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 56 

Income tax expense . Our income tax expense was 42.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, up from 37.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing an effective tax rate ETR of 24.3 in the third quarter of 2024, up from 24.1 in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in our ETR was primarily driven by lower discrete benefits in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Net income . As a result of the foregoing factors, net income as a percentage of net revenues was 11.0 in the third quarter of 2024, up from 10.4 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Adjusted income fr om operations . Adjusted income from operations AOI increased by 18.0 million, from 195.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 213.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. Our AOI margin increased from 17.2 in the third quarter of 2023 to 17.6 in the third quarter of 2024, largely due to improved operational efficiencies in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 . 
 AOI and AOI margin are non-GAAP measures and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. They should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We believe that presenting AOI alongside our reported results offers useful supplemental information to our investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using AOI versus net income calculated in accordance with GAAP is that AOI excludes certain recurring costs and certain other charges, namely stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information on the GAAP amounts excluded from AOI. 
 We calculate AOI as net income, excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets, (iii) foreign exchange (gains)/losses, net, (iv) interest (income) expense, net, and (v) income tax expense, as we believe that our results after considering these adjustments more accurately reflect our ongoing operations. To calculate AOI margin, we divided AOI (as calculated above) by net revenue. For additional information, see Note 18 Segment reporting under Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements above. 
 The following table shows the reconciliation of AOI to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024:

The following table sets forth our AOI by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024: 
 
 Three months ended 
 September 30, 
 Percentage Change Increase/(Decrease) 2023 2024 2024 vs. 2023 
 (dollars in millions) Financial Services 53.0 58.3 10.0 Consumer and Healthcare 62.3 74.5 19.5 High Tech and Manufacturing 83.1 81.2 (2.3) Total reportable segment 198.4 214.0 7.9 Others (3.4) (1.0) (71.9) Adjusted income from operations 195.0 213.0 9.2 
 
 AOI of our Financial Services segment increased to 58.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 53.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher revenues and operating efficiency in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. AOI of our Consumer and Healthcare segment increased to 74.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 62.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, largely due to higher revenue from large deal ramp-ups and operating efficiencies in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. AOI of our High Tech and Manufacturing segment decreased to 81.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 83.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher investment in delivery commitments, partially offset by higher revenue, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 AOI for Others in the table above primarily represents the adjustment of allowances for credit losses and over- or under-absorption of corporate overheads which is not allocated to any individual segment for management's internal reporting purposes. See Note 18 Segment reporting under Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements above.

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net revenues. Our net revenues were 3,518.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up 187.8 million, or 5.6 , from 3,330.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted for foreign exchange, primarily the impact of changes in the values of the Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, Australian dollar, Indian rupee and South African rand against the U.S. dollar, our net revenues grew 6.0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 on a constant currency 3 basis. We provide information about our revenue growth on a constant currency 3 basis so that our revenue may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Net revenues on a constant currency 3 basis are calculated by restating current-period activity using the prior fiscal period s foreign currency exchange rates and adjusted for hedging gains/losses. 
 Our average headcount increased by 10.1 to approximately 133,900 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 121,600 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net revenues from Data-Tech-AI services in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,639.3 million, up 81.0 million, or 5.2 , from 1,558.3 million i n the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was largely driven by ramp-ups of services from recently signed large deals and an increase in revenue from our data and analytics solutions embedded in our finance and accounting, supply chain and risk management services in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net revenues from Digital Operations services in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,879.1 million, up 106.7 million, or 6.0 , from 1,772.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to ramp-ups of services for large deals signed in 2023 as well as recently signed large deals. 

3 Revenue growth on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated by restating current-period activity using the prior fiscal period s foreign currency exchange rates adjusted for hedging gains/losses in such period.

 Not Meaningful 
 
 Net revenues from our Financial Services segment increased by 4.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to ramp-ups of services from large deals. Net revenues from our Consumer and Healthcare segment increased by 6.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily driven by ramp-ups of services from large deals signed in 2023 and recently signed deals as well as an increase in supply chain engagements. Net revenues from our High Tech and Manufacturing segment increased by 5.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , largely driven by ramp-ups of deals signed in 2023 as well as recently signed new deals. Net revenues from "Business held for sale" in the table above represent revenues from a business we had previously classified as held for sale w ith effect from April 1, 2022 as part of a series of actions we took in 2022 to focus our business on emerging solutions where we see the greatest opportunities for growth and to deprioritize assets that no longer fit with our long-term strategy. The sale of the business we had previously classified as held for sale was completed in the first quarter of 2023. For additional information, see Note 7 Assets and liabilities held for sale and Note 18 Segment reporting under Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements above. 
 
 Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue was 2,274.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up 106.6 million, or 4.9 , from 2,167.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to (i) an increase in our operational headcount to support revenue growth, (ii) wage inflation, (iii) higher infrastructure expenses, and (iv) increased spending on professional services in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was partially offset by lower travel related expenses, lower stock-based compensation expense and lower depreciation and amortization expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Gross margin. Our gross margin increased from 34.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 35.4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved operating leverage, lower stock-based compensation expense and lower depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by wage inflation (net of contractual COLA) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses. SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased from 20.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 20.4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . SG A expenses were 718.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , up 42.3 million, or 6.3 , from 675.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in SG A expenses was primarily due to an increase in our sales and marketing spend to support business growth, a higher allowance for credit losses, increased spending on professional services, higher travel related expenses and wage inflation in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense and operating leverage in support functions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets was 20.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 4.0 million, or 16.8 , from 24.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the completion of useful lives of intangible assets acquired in prior periods. 
 60 

Other operating (income) expense, net. Other operating income (net of expense) was 5.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The change was primarily due to the receipt of 1.5 million upon the redemption of a loan note associated with the sale of a business previously classified as held for sale and the waiver by a vendor of a liability in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Additionally, a gain of 4.9 million was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 upon the successful termination of a lease that was abandoned as part of the 2022 restructuring described above . For additional information, see Note 7 "Assets and liabilities held for sale" and Note 24 Restructuring under Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements above. 
 
 Income from operations. As a result of the foregoing factors, income from operations as a percentage of net reven ues increased from 14.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Income from operations increased by 43.8 million from 468.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 511.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a higher gross margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Foreign exchange gains, net. We recorded a net foreign exchange gain of 4.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up 0.7 million from 3.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gain primarily resulted from the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. 
 
 Interest income (expense), net . Our interest expense (net of interest income) was 36.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , up 1.1 million from 35.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due to a 10.9 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a 9.7 million increase in interest income. Our interest income increased from 13.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 22.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , due to higher cash balances in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in interest expense was largely due to (i) incremental interest expense on our senior notes issued in June 2024, (ii) a higher average benchmark-based rate on our revolving credit facility and term loan, and (iii) lower gains on interest rate swaps entered into to hedge interest rate exposure on our term loan. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a lower amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The weighted average rate of interest on our debt, including the net impact of interest rate swaps, increased from 3.5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . See the section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources Financial Condition for further discussion. 
 
 Other income (expense), net. Our other income (net of expense) was 14.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily driven by (i) a gain on changes in the fair value of assets in our deferred compensation plan in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss on changes in the fair value of assets in our deferred compensation plan in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and (ii) higher sublease income and related corporate transactions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income tax expense. Our income tax expense was 122.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , up from 103.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , representing an ETR of 24.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , up from 23.4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in our ETR was primarily driven by lower tax deductions related to stock-based compensation in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Net income . As a result of the foregoing factors, net income as a percentage of net revenues was 10.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up from 10.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Adjusted income from operations . Adjusted income from operations AOI increased by 33.3 million from 559.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 593.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Our AOI margin increased to 16.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 16.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to higher operating leverage, partially offset by higher sales and marketing expenses .

AOI and AOI margin are non-GAAP measures and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. They should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We believe that presenting AOI alongside our reported results offers useful supplemental information to our investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using AOI versus net income calculated in accordance with GAAP is that AOI excludes certain recurring costs and certain other charges, namely stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information on the GAAP amounts excluded from AOI. 
 We calculate AOI as net income, excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets, (iii) foreign exchange (gains)/losses, net, (iv) restructuring (income) expense, (v) the loss on the sale of the business classified as held for sale, (vi) interest (income) expense, net, (vii) the operating loss from the business classified as held for sale, and (viii) income tax expense, as we believe that our results after taking into account these adjustments more accurately reflect our ongoing operations. To calculate AOI margin, we divided AOI (as calculated above) by net revenue, excluding revenue from the business previously classified as held for sale. For additional information, see Note 18 Segment reporting under Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements above. 
 During the second quarter of 2022, management approved a plan to divest a business (the "Business") that was part of our Consumer and Healthcare segment. The divestiture was completed in the first quarter of 2023. As a result, we classified the assets and liabilities of the Business as held for sale and recorded net revenues of 0.5 million and a loss of 1.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The sale of the Business was completed in the first quarter of 2023. Accordingly, there was no revenue or operating loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the Business. We also recorded a loss of 0.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 on the sale of the Business. For additional information, see Note 7 "Assets and liabilities held for sale" and Note 18 Segment reporting under Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements above.

AO I of our Financial Services segment increased to 158.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 145.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , largely driven by higher revenues and operating efficiency in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . AOI of our Consumer and Healthcare segment increased to 212.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 177.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , largely driven by higher revenue from large deal ramp-ups and improved efficiencies. AOI of our High Tech and Manufacturing segment increased to 224.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 217.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , largely driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher investment in delivery commitments. 
 
 AOI for Others in the table above primarily represents the adjustment of allowances for credit losses and over- or under-absorption of corporate overheads, none of which is allocated to any individual segment for management's internal reporting purposes. AOI for "business classified as held for sale" in the table above primarily represents the loss attributable to a business previously classified as held for sale. See Note 7 Assets and liabilities held for sale and Note 18 Segment reporting under Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements above.

 Financial Condition 
 
 We have historically financed our operations and our expansion, including acquisitions, with cash from operations and borrowing facilities. 
 
 On February 9, 2023, our board of directors approved a 10 increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 0.125 per common share to 0.1375 per common share, representing an annual dividend of 0.55 per common share for 2023, up from 0.50 per common share in 2022. On March 24, 2023, June 26, 2023 and September 26, 2023, we paid a dividend of 0.1375 per share, amounting to 25.3 million, 25.0 million and 24.9 million in the aggregate, to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2023, June 9, 2023 and September 8, 2023, respectively. 
 
 On February 8, 2024, our board of directors approved an 11 increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 0.1375 per common share to 0.1525 per common share, representing a planned annual dividend of 0.61 per common share for 2024, up from 0.55 per common share in 2023. On March 26, 2024, June 26, 2024 and September 25, 2024, we paid a dividend of 0.1525 per share, amounting to 27.5 million, 27.3 million and 26.9 million in the aggregate, to shareholders of record as of March 11, 2024, June 10, 2024 and September 11, 2024, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 1,022.1 million of our 1,022.6 million in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign (non-Bermuda) subsidiaries. 133.9 million of this cash was held by foreign subsidiaries for which we expect to incur and have accrued a deferred tax liability on the repatriation of 80.4 million of retained earnings. 412.5 million of the cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries in jurisdictions where no tax is expected to be imposed upon repatriation. The remaining 475.7 million in cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries is being indefinitely reinvested. 
 64 

The total authorization under our existing share repurchase program is 2,250.0 million, of which 232.0 million remained available as of September 30, 2024. Since our share repurchase program was initially authorized in 2015, we have repurchased 62,898,383 of our common shares at an average price of 32.08 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 2,018.0 million. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we repurchased 3,828,084 and 4,720,308 of our common shares, respectively, on the open market at a weighted average price of 39.31 and 35.50 per share, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of 150.5 million and 167.6 million, respectively. All repurchased shares have been retired. 
 
 For additional information, see Note 16 Capital stock under Part I, Item 1 Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements above. 
 
 We expect that for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future, our cash from operations, cash reserves and debt capacity will be sufficient to finance our operations, our growth and expansion plans, dividend payments and additional share repurchases we may make under our share repurchase program. In addition, we may raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing. Our working capital needs are primarily to finance our payroll and other administrative and information technology expenses in advance of the receipt of accounts receivable. Our primary capital requirements include opening new delivery centers, expanding existing operations to support our growth, financing acquisitions and enhancing capabilities, including building certain digital solutions. 
 
 Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 
 Percentage 
 Change 
 2023 2024 2024 vs. 2023 
 (dollars in millions) Net cash provided by/(used for): Operating activities 298.9 412.2 37.9 Investing activities (60.1) (64.7) 7.7 Financing activities (338.3) 92.6 127.4 Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 
 (99.4) 440.0 542.6 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 412.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 298.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by (i) a 31.8 million increase in net income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and (ii) an 86.6 million decrease in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by lower tax payments, higher service tax refunds and higher advances received from clients, partially offset by higher accounts receivable balances in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This increase was partially offset by a 5.1 million reduction in non-cash expense, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense, lower depreciation and amortization expense and an unrealized gain on the revaluation of foreign currency assets/liabilities compared to an unrealized loss in 2023, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax expense and an increase in allowances for credit losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Cash flows used for investing activities. Our net cash used for investing activities was 64.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 60.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used for payments (net of sales proceeds) for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and internally generated intangible assets was 64.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 39.9 million the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used for the divestiture of a business previously classified as held for sale was 19.5 million and cash used for business combinations was 0.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while no corresponding payments were made in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 65 

Cash flows used for/provided by financing activities. Our net cash provided by financing activities was 92.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used for financing activities of 338.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily due to (i) higher proceeds from borrowings (net of repayment), amounting to 363.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to repayment of borrowings (net of proceeds) of 115.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and (ii) a 2.4 million payment of earn-out consideration in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with no corresponding payment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase in cash flows from financing activities was partially offset by (i) a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common shares under our stock-based compensation plans to 12.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 34.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, (ii) higher payments for stock repurchased and retired (including related expenses), amounting to 167.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 150.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, (iii) higher dividend payments, amounting to 81.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 75.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and (iv) higher payments for the net settlement of stock-based awards, amounting to 21.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financing Arrangements 
 
 In December 2022, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "2022 Credit Agreement") with Genpact USA, Inc. Genpact USA ), Genpact Global Holdings (Bermuda) Limited GGH and Genpact Luxembourg S. r.l. Genpact Luxembourg , and together with Genpact USA and GGH, the Borrowers ), as borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo ), as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing bank, and the lenders and other parties thereto, which consists of a 530.0 million term loan and a 650.0 million revolving credit facility. An additional third-party fee paid in connection with the 2022 Credit Agreement is being amortized over the duration of the term loan and revolving credit facility, which expire on December 13, 2027. In connection with our entry into the 2022 Credit Agreement, we terminated our previous credit facility under our amended and restated credit agreement entered into in August 2018 (the 2018 Credit Agreement with the Borrowers, as borrowers, Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, and the lenders and other financial institutions party thereto, which was comprised of a 680.0 million term loan and a 500.0 million revolving credit facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement replaced the 2018 Credit Agreement. 
 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries. The obligations under the 2022 Credit Agreement are unsecured. 
 
 The outstanding balance of the term loan under the 2018 Credit Agreement as of the date of the 2022 Credit Agreement was 527.0 million. The term loan and the revolving credit facility under the 2022 Credit Agreement have a term of five years and expire on December 13, 2027. The 2022 Credit Agreement did not result in a substantial modification of 290.9 million of the outstanding term loan under the 2018 Credit Agreement. As a result of the 2022 Credit Agreement, we extinguished 236.1 million of funding arrangements for the outstanding term loan under the 2018 Credit Agreement and obtained funding from new lenders of 239.1 million, resulting in outstanding principal of 530.0 million of the term loan under the 2022 Credit Agreement. In connection with the 2022 Credit Agreement, we expensed 0.1 million, representing partial acceleration of the amortization of the existing unamortized debt issuance costs and an additional fee paid to our lenders related to the term loan under the 2022 Credit Agreement. The overall borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility under the 2022 Credit Agreement is 650.0 million, an increase from 500.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement. The remaining unamortized costs and an additional third-party fee paid in connection with the 2022 Credit Agreement will be amortized over the term of the facility, which will expire on December 13, 2027. 
 
 Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to, at our election, either Adjusted Term SOFR (which is the rate per annum equal to (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus (b) a Term SOFR Adjustment of 0.10 per annum, but in no case lower than 0.00 plus an applicable margin equal to 1.375 per annum or a base rate plus an applicable margin equal to 0.375 per annum, in each case subject to adjustment based on the Borrowers' debt ratings provided by Standard Poor s Rating Services and Moody s Investors Service, Inc. from time to time (the "Debt Ratings"). The revolving credit commitments under the 2022 Credit Agreement are subject to a commitment fee equal to 0.20 per annum, subject to adjustment based on the Debt Ratings. The commitment fee accrues on the actual daily amount by which the aggregate revolving commitments exceed the sum of outstanding revolving loans and letter of credit obligations. 
 66 

The 2022 Credit Agreement restricts certain payments, including dividend payments, if there is an event of default under the 2022 Credit Agreement or if we are not, or after making the payment would not be, in compliance with certain financial covenants contained in the 2022 Credit Agreement. These covenants require us to maintain a net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of less than 3x and an interest coverage ratio of more than 3x. During the period ended September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement, including all of the financial covenants therein. Our retained earnings are not subject to any restrictions on availability to make dividend payments to shareholders, subject to compliance with the financial covenants described above that are contained in the 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, our outstanding term loan, net of debt amortization expense of 1.3 million and 1.0 million, respectively, was 508.9 million and 482.6 million, respectively. We also have fund-based and non-fund based credit facilities with banks, which are available for operational requirements in the form of overdrafts, letters of credit, guarantees and short-term loans. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the limits available under such facilities were 23.3 million and 22.9 million, respectively, of which 9.3 million and 8.8 million, respectively, was utilized, constituting non-funded drawdown. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, a total of 11.6 million and 1.5 million, respectively, of our revolving credit facility was utilized, of which 10.0 million and 0, respectively, constituted funded drawdown and 1.6 million and 1.5 million, respectively, constituted non-funded drawdown. Our outstanding term loan and revolving credit facility expire on December 13, 2027. 
 We manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness by entering into interest rate swaps under which we receive floating rate payments based on the greater of Term SOFR and the floor rate under our term loan and make payments based on a fixed rate. As of September 30, 2024 , we were party to interest rate swaps covering a total notional amount of 237.5 million. Under these swap agreements, the rate that we pay to banks in exchange for Term SOFR ranges between 4.25 and 4.72 . 
 In November 2019, Genpact Luxembourg issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 senior notes (the 2019 Senior Notes ). The 2019 Senior Notes are fully guaranteed by the Company and Genpact USA.

As part of this arrangement, accounts receivable sold under this facility are de-recognized upon sale along with the related allowances, if any. As of each of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we had a revolving accounts receivable-based facility of 75.0 million and 60.0 million, respectively, permitting us to sell accounts receivable to banks on a non-recourse basis in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate maximum capacity utilized at any time during the period ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 was 51.4 million and 55.9 million, respectively.

 The Senior Notes and the related guarantees rank pari passu in right of payment with all senior and unsecured debt of the Debt Issuers and Guarantors and rank senior in right of payment to all of the Debt Issuers and Guarantors future subordinated debt. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all of the Debt Issuers and Guarantors existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future debt and other liabilities of the Guarantors subsidiaries (other than the Issuer), including the liabilities of certain subsidiaries pursuant to our senior credit facility. The non-Guarantors are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due under the Senior Notes or to make the funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payment. If the Debt Issuers and Guarantors have any right to receive any assets of any of the non-Guarantors upon the insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of any non-Guarantor, all of that non-Guarantor s creditors (including trade creditors) would be entitled to payment in full out of that non-Guarantor s assets before the holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled to any payment.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates on the floating rate indebtedness under our term loan and revolving credit facility and the 2019 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. Borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at floating rates based on Term SOFR, but in no event less than the floor rate of 0.0 plus an applicable margin. The interest rates on our 2019 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes are subject to adjustment based on the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor s Rating Services, Inc. from time to time. A decline in such ratings could result in an increase of up to 2 in the rate of interest on the 2019 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates or a decline in ratings may increase or decrease our interest expense which would, in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow. 
 
 70 

We manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness by entering into interest rate swaps under which we receive floating rate payments based on the greater of SOFR and the floor rate under our term loan and make payments based on a fixed rate. Under these swap agreements, the rate that we pay to banks in exchange for Term SOFR ranges between 4.25 and 4.72 . 
 
 In March 2021, we executed a treasury rate lock agreement covering 350 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2021 Senior Notes, and the treasury rate lock agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge. The treasury rate lock agreement was terminated on March 23, 2021, and a deferred gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2021 Senior Notes. The remaining gain to be amortized related to the treasury rate lock agreement as of September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million. 
 
 In May 2024, we executed treasury rate lock agreements for 400 million in connection with future interest payments to be made on our 2024 Senior Notes, and the treasury rate lock agreements were designated as a cash flow hedge. The treasury rate lock agreements were terminated on May 30, 2024, and a deferred loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2024 Senior Notes. The remaining loss to be amortized related to the treasury rate lock agreements as of September 30, 2024 was 0.4 Million.
