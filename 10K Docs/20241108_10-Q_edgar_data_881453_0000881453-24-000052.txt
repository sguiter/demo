 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had novations within our Ceded Business related to variable-indexed annuities under the reinsurance agreement with Pruco Life Insurance Company that resulted in non-cash transactions of million of investments with a corresponding offset to the modified coinsurance payable. There was no significant non-cash novation activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 5 for non-cash disclosures regarding collateral transferred under repurchase agreements.

1. 

Novation of Ceded Business 
 
 In 2022, in accordance with applicable state law, a program was instituted to novate a significant portion of the Ceded Business policies from FLIAC to Pruco Life Insurance Company ("Pruco Life"). The program did not have an impact on total equity or net income but has resulted in the reduction of certain activity/balances associated with these policies. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately million and million, respectively, of account value, 
 which generally approximates fair values of insurance liabilities, was transferred out of the Company as a result of the novation program. 
 
 There was no significant novation activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we do not expect significant future novation activity under the current program. Since the acquisition of the Company on April 1, 2022, approximately percent of account value in the Ceded Business has been novated to Pruco Life under this program. 
 
 Fair Value of Insurance Liabilities - Actuarial Assumption Updates 
 
 In the third quarter of both 2024 and 2023, the Company completed its annual review of actuarial assumptions related to its fair value of insurance liabilities. Based on those reviews, the Company updated certain assumptions associated with its variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefits in each period, which resulted in an increase (decrease) in its fair value of insurance liabilities of ) million and million during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2023 increase was driven by updates to assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, primarily to reflect lower observed surrender rates. 
 
 The impact of the respective assumption updates on the Consolidated Statement of Operations was included within "Policyholder benefits and changes in fair value of insurance liabilities". 
 
 The assumptions used in establishing our insurance liabilities are generally based on the Company s experience, industry experience, market observable data, and/or other factors, as applicable. The Company evaluates its actuarial assumptions at least annually and updates them as appropriate, unless a material change that the Company feels is indicative of a long-term trend is observed in an interim period. Generally, the Company does not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, the Company expects such changes to be gradual over the long-term. See Note 7 in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion regarding significant assumptions related to our fair value of insurance liabilities.

million through the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the third quarter of 2023. Following this impairment, there was remaining goodwill as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by unfavorable actuarial assumption updates, as compared to its initial projections, related to the determination of the fair value of its insurance liabilities, and lower overall projected future earnings as a result of capital market volatility.

 reportable segments, which we refer to as the "Retained Business" and the "Ceded Business." 
 
 The Retained Business consists of variable annuity products with guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit features as well as smaller blocks of variable annuity products with certain other living benefit and death benefit features. The Retained Business also includes variable universal life and fixed payout annuity products. The Retained Business is actively managed by FLIAC management and we retain the full economic benefits and risks. 
 
 The Ceded Business represents certain business (primarily registered index-linked annuities and fixed annuities, which includes fixed indexed and fixed deferred annuities, and other variable annuities) where percent of the assets and liabilities are fully ceded to Prudential Insurance and Pruco Life under existing coinsurance and modified coinsurance agreements. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a modified coinsurance payable of million and million, respectively, equal to the assets held in the Ceded Business, and are included in the net modified coinsurance payable. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2023, the Company determined that the goodwill associated with its Retained Business was fully impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment of million through the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Following this impairment, there was remaining goodwill as of September 30, 2023. See Note 1 contained herein for further information.

 (1) Conversely, the impact of a decrease in input would have the opposite impact on fair value as that presented in the table. 
 (2) The equity volatility curve assumption is based on 1 year and 2 year index-specific at-the-money implied volatilities grading to 10 year total variance. Increased volatility increases the fair value of the liability. 
 (3) Lapse rates for contracts with living benefit guarantees are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the living benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. Lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. Lapse rates for contracts with index-linked crediting guarantees may be adjusted at the contract level based on the applicability of any surrender charges, product type, and market related factors such as interest rates. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply. 
 (4) The spread over the risk-free rate swap curve represents the premium added to the proxy for the risk-free rate to reflect the Company's estimates of rates that a market participant would use to value the living benefits in both the accumulation and payout phases and index-linked interest crediting guarantees. This spread includes an estimate of own-credit risk (OCR), which is the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled by the Company. OCR is primarily estimated by utilizing the credit spreads associated with issuing funding agreements, adjusted for any illiquidity risk premium. In order to reflect the financial strength ratings of the Company, credit spreads associated with funding agreements, as opposed to credit spread associated with debt, are utilized in developing this estimate because funding agreements, living benefit guarantees, and index-linked interest crediting guarantees are insurance liabilities and are therefore senior to debt. 
 (5) The utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contracts that will utilize the benefit during the contract duration and begin lifetime withdrawals at various time intervals from contract inception. Utilization assumptions may vary by product type, tax status and age. The impact of changes in these assumptions is highly dependent on the product type, the age of the contractholder at the time of the sale, and the timing of the first lifetime income withdrawal.

 Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 

 and , respectively, the maximum withdrawal rate assumption may be greater than in each period. The fair value of the liability will generally increase the closer the withdrawal rate is to and decrease as the withdrawal rate moves further away from . 
 (7) The range reflects the mortality rates for the vast majority of business with living benefits, with policyholders ranging from to years old. While the majority of living benefits have a minimum age requirement, certain other contracts do not have an age restriction. This results in contractholders with mortality rates approaching for certain benefits. 
 
 Interrelationships Between Unobservable Inputs In addition to the sensitivities of fair value measurements to changes in each unobservable input in isolation, as reflected in the table above, interrelationships between these inputs may also exist, such that a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another, or multiple, inputs. Examples of such interrelationships for significant internally-priced Level 3 assets and liabilities are as follows: 
 
 Corporate Securities The rate used to discount future cash flows reflects current risk-free rates plus credit and liquidity spread requirements that market participants would use to value an asset. The discount rate may be influenced by many factors, including market cycles, expectations of default, collateral, term and asset complexity. Each of these factors can influence discount rates, either in isolation, or in response to other factors. During weaker economic cycles, as the expectations of default increases, credit spreads widen, which results in a decrease in fair value. 
 
 Insurance Liabilities, at fair value The Company expects efficient benefit utilization and withdrawal rates to generally be correlated with lapse rates. However, behavior is highly dependent on the facts and circumstances surrounding the individual contractholder, such as their liquidity needs or tax situation, which could drive lapse behavior independent of other contractholder behavior assumptions. To the extent that more efficient contractholder behavior results in greater in-the-moneyness at the contract level, lapse rates may decline for those contracts. Similarly, to the extent that increases in equity volatility are correlated with overall declines in the capital markets, lapse rates may decline as contracts become more in-the-money.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Fortitude Life Insurance Annuity Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary (collectively, FLIAC or the Company ), with its principal offices in Jersey City, New Jersey, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortitude Group Holdings, LLC FGH ). 
 
 The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the MD A, the Risk Factors section, and the audited Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as the statements under Forward-Looking Statements , and the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 
 
 The Company was established in 1969 and has been a provider of annuity contracts for the individual market in the United States. The Company s products have been sold primarily to individuals to provide for long-term savings and retirement needs and to address the economic impact of premature death, estate planning concerns and supplemental retirement income. 
 
 The Company has sold a wide array of annuities, including deferred and immediate variable annuities with (1) fixed interest rate allocation options, subject to a market value adjustment, that are registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and (2) fixed-rate allocation options subject to a limited market value adjustment or no market value adjustment and not registered with the SEC. The Company ceased offering these products. 
 
 Novation of Ceded Business 
 
 In 2022, in accordance with applicable state law, a program was instituted to novate a significant portion of the Ceded Business policies from FLIAC to Pruco Life Insurance Company ("Pruco Life"). The program did not have an impact on total equity or net income but has resulted in the reduction of certain activity/balances associated with these policies. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 172 million and 635 million, respectively, of account value, 
 which generally approximates fair values of insurance liabilities, was transferred out of the Company as a result of the novation program. 
 
 There was no significant novation activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we do not expect significant future novation activity under the current program. Since the acquisition of the Company on April 1, 2022, approximately 73 percent of account value in the Ceded Business has been novated to Pruco Life under this program. 
 
 Fair Value of Insurance Liabilities - Actuarial Assumption Updates 
 
 In the third quarter of both 2024 and 2023, the Company completed its annual review of actuarial assumptions related to its fair value of insurance liabilities. Based on those reviews, the Company updated certain assumptions associated with its variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefits in each period, which resulted in an increase (decrease) in its fair value of insurance liabilities of (3) million and 116 million during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2023 increase was driven by updates to assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, primarily to reflect lower observed surrender rates. 
 
 The impact of the respective assumption updates on the Consolidated Statement of Operations was included within "Policyholder benefits and changes in fair value of insurance liabilities". 
 
 The assumptions used in establishing our insurance liabilities are generally based on the Company s experience, industry experience, market observable data, and/or other factors, as applicable. The Company evaluates its actuarial assumptions at least annually and updates them as appropriate, unless a material change that the Company feels is indicative of a long-term trend is observed in an interim period. Generally, the Company does not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, the Company expects such changes to be gradual over the long-term. See Note 7 in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further discussion regarding significant assumptions related to our fair value of insurance liabilities.

 2023 Goodwill Impairment 
 
 As a result of its third quarter of 2023 actuarial assumption update, the Company identified a triggering event regarding its goodwill impairment analysis for the Retained Business. Following a qualitative analysis that indicated the fair value of the reporting unit may be lower than its carrying value, the Company performed a quantitative analysis that involved both discounted cash flow techniques and market price comparisons to establish fair values on its underlying assets and liabilities. After performing this quantitative analysis, the Company determined that the goodwill was fully impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment of 93 million through the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the third quarter of 2023. Following this impairment, there was no remaining goodwill as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by unfavorable actuarial assumption updates, as compared to its initial projections, related to the determination of the fair value of its insurance liabilities, and lower overall projected future earnings as a result of capital market volatility. 

Group Supervision Updates 
 
 Effective April 1, 2024, the Bermuda Monetary Authority ("BMA") made a final determination that it is appropriate for the BMA to be the group supervisor for FGH Parent, L.P. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Fortitude Re ). FGH Parent, L.P. is a Bermuda-domiciled exempted limited partnership, which serves as the holding company for the Company and its affiliates. As a result of the BMA s determination to be group supervisor of Fortitude Re, Fortitude Re will be subject to group capital standards, additional examination as an insurance group, and participation in supervisory college activities as determined by the BMA and other competent authorities supervising the entities in the insurance group. The Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions ("DIFI") will remain the supervisor of FLIAC and its affiliated U.S. insurance subsidiaries within Fortitude Re and will coordinate its activities with the BMA regarding overall supervision of Fortitude Re. We do not expect FLIAC to incur significant additional costs resulting from the BMA s designation as group supervisor for Fortitude Re but the Company may be subject to additional examinations and inquiries from the BMA as part of their routine supervision process. 
 
 Impact of a Changing Interest Rate Environment 
 
 As a financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in interest rates can affect our results of operations and/or our financial condition in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to: 
 
 investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net interest margins, net investment spread results, new money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions; 
 the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to losses on our fixed maturity securities portfolio; 
 hedging costs and other risk mitigation activities; 
 insurance reserve levels and market experience true-ups; 
 customer account values, including their impact on fee income; 
 product design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and 
 policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity. 
 
 For more information on interest rate risks, see Risk Factors Market Risk included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Revenues and Expenses 
 
 The Company earns revenues principally from contract fees , mortality and expense fees, and asset administration fees from annuity and investment products, all of which pr imarily result from the sale and servicing of annuity products. The Company also earns net investment income from the investment of general account and other funds. The Company s operating expenses principally consist of annuity benefit guarantees provided, reserves established for anticipated future annuity benefit guarantees, and costs of managing risk related to these products. The Company's operating expenses also include general business expenses, reinsurance premiums, and commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products it sold.

 Accounting Policies Pronouncements 
 
 Application of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the Company s results of operations and financial position as reported in the Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements could change significantly. 
 
 Management believes the accounting policies relating to the following areas are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments: 
 
 Insurance liabilities; 
 Valuation of investments, including derivatives; and 
 Taxes on income, including valuation allowances 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Changes to U.S. GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") in the form of an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") to the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC").

 Segment and Product Overview 
 
 Our business is comprised of two major blocks of in-force policies, which we refer to as the Retained Business and the Ceded Business . The Retained Business consists of variable annuity products with guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit features as well as smaller blocks of variable annuity products with certain other living benefit and death benefit features. The Retained Business also includes variable universal life and fixed payout annuity products. The Retained Business is actively managed by FLIAC management and the Company retains the full economic benefits and risks. The Retained Business consists of variable annuity contracts originated between 1993 2010. These products allow the holder to direct investments into certain separate account funds to receive tax deferred build-up within the contract. Most of the contracts have optional living benefit riders, commonly known as guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, which entitle the holder to elect to withdraw a guaranteed amount from the contract while alive, irrespective of the balance in their separate account. Almost all of the contracts also offer a guaranteed amount payable to a beneficiary upon the death of the holder, which is commonly known as a guaranteed minimum death benefit. 
 
 The Ceded Business represents certain business (primarily registered index linked-annuities and fixed annuities, which includes fixed indexed and fixed deferred annuities, and other variable annuities) where 100 percent of the assets and liabilities have been fully ceded to Prudential Insurance and Pruco Life under existing coinsurance and modified coinsurance agreements. The Ceded Business will continue to impact certain line items within the Company s financial statements but will not have a material impact to stockholders equity or net income and will represent the economic impact assumed by Prudential Insurance and Pruco Life. 

Changes in Financial Position 
 
 The following is a discussion regarding changes in the financial position of the Company by reportable segment. 
 
 Retained Business 
 
 Assets decreased 98 million to 27,127 million at September 30, 2024 from 27,225 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower invested assets and cash and cash equivalents resulting from the payment of the 150 million dividend to FGH during 2024, partially offsetting the decline was an increase in the fair value of fixed maturity securities resulting from the impact of lower interest rates. 
 
 Liabilities decreased 75 million to 25,788 million at September 30, 2024 from 25,863 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the fair value of insurance liabilities due primarily to favorable equity market movements, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Partially offsetting the overall decline in liabilities was the increase in liabilities associated with secured borrowing arrangements. 
 
 Equity decreased 23 million to 1,339 million at September 30, 2024 from 1,362 million at December 31, 2023, due primarily to the 150 million dividend payment to FGH during 2024, which was partially offset by the year-to-date impacts of net income of 92 million and the 35 million net-of-tax improvement in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to movements in our own-credit risk (OCR) on the fair value of insurance liabilities. 
 
 Ceded Business 
 
 Assets increased 161 million to 4,489 million at September 30, 2024 from 4,328 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by higher derivative fair values related to equity options, resulting from favorable equity market movements, and an increase in the fair value of fixed maturity securities resulting from net purchases and the impacts of lower interest rates, partially offset by declines in reinsurance recoverables and the deposit asset. 
 
 Liabilities increased 161 million to 4,489 million at September 30, 2024 from 4,328 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the fair value of insurance liabilities, resulting from the impact of lower interest rates, and a higher net modified coinsurance payable resulting from an increase in the fair values of investments in the portfolio. 
 
 There was no equity within our Ceded Business at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as the assets are fully offset by the liabilities.

 Results of Operations 
 
 INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 
 
 Quarter-to-Date Comparison to Prior Period 
 
 Retained Business 
 
 Loss from operations before income taxes was 24 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss from operations before income taxes of 223 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement was driven primarily by the 116 million impact of the 2023 actuarial assumption update and the corresponding 93 million impact of the 2023 impairment of goodwill. 
 
 Ceded Business 
 
 There was no impact to the income from operations before income taxes as all revenues and expenses are ceded to Prudential Insurance or Pruco Life. 
 
 Year-to-Date Comparison to Prior Period 
 
 Retained Business 
 
 Income from operations before income taxes was 112 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss from operations before income taxes of 61 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The favorable change was primarily driven by the 116 million impact of the 2023 actuarial assumption update and the corresponding 93 million impact of the 2023 impairment of goodwill. 
 
 Ceded Business 
 
 There was no impact to the income from operations before income taxes as all revenues and expenses are ceded to Prudential Insurance or Pruco Life. 
 
 REVENUES, BENEFITS, AND EXPENSES 
 
 Quarter-to-Date Comparison to Prior Period 
 
 Retained Business 
 
 Revenues were 364 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (232) million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by gains on both fixed maturity securities and interest rate swaps resulting from the impact of declining interest rates, partially offset by losses on equity derivatives. 
 
 Benefits and expenses were 388 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (9) million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change was driven by less favorable changes in the fair value of insurance liabilities, excluding changes in OCR, resulting from the impact of declining interest rates, partially offset by favorable impacts from the 2024 actuarial assumption compared to the prior year. 
 
 Ceded Business 
 
 There was no impact to the income from operations before income taxes as all revenues and expenses are ceded to Prudential Insurance or Pruco Life.

 Retained Business 
 
 Revenues were 166 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (197) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the favorable change between periods was primarily driven by investment gains on fixed maturity securities resulting from the impact of declining interest rates. 
 
 Benefits and expenses were 54 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (136) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change between periods was primarily driven by less favorable declines in the fair value of insurance liabilities, excluding changes in OCR, resulting from the impact of declining interest rates, partially offset by favorable impacts from the 2024 actuarial assumption compared to the prior year. 
 
 Ceded Business 
 
 There was no impact to the income from operations before income taxes as all revenues and expenses are ceded back to Prudential Insurance or Pruco Life.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 This section supplements and should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet the short-term and long-term cash requirements of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our business, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our business, general economic conditions, our ability to borrow and our access to capital markets. 
 
 Effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization. Management monitors the liquidity of the Company on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon. We use a Risk Appetite Framework RAF to ensure that all risks taken by the Company aligns with our capacity and willingness to take those risks. The RAF provides a dynamic assessment of capital and liquidity stress impacts and is intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available to absorb those impacts. We believe that our capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to satisfy the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company. 
 
 Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by domestic and international regulators. These regulations currently include requirements (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, credit exposure reporting and credit concentration. For information on these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see Business - Regulation" and Risk Factors included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Capital 
 
 We manage FLIAC to regulatory capital levels and utilize the risk-based capital RBC ratio as a primary measure of capital adequacy. RBC is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC ). RBC considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer s products and liabilities, equity market and interest rate risks and general business risks. RBC determines the minimum amount of capital required of an insurer to support its operations and underwriting coverage. The ratio of a company s Total Adjusted Capital TAC to RBC is the 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 corresponding RBC ratio. RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer s solvency and ability to pay future claims. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public. The Company s capital levels substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. Our regulatory capital levels may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators. 
 
 The regulatory capital level of the Company can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations, changes in the values of derivatives, the level of impairments recorded, and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio, among other items. In addition, the reinsurance of business or the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by, or credit quality migration affecting, the reinsurers or for other reasons could negatively impact regulatory capital levels. The Company s regulatory capital level is also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator. 
 
 Dividends and Distributions to Parent 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, a 150 million dividend was approved by the Company's board of directors, 75 million of which was considered an ordinary dividend and was not subject to approval by the Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions ("DIFI") prior to payment and was accrued for as of March 31, 2024. The other 75 million was conditioned upon the Company receiving written approval from the Arizona DIFI prior to payment and was not accrued for as of March 31, 2024. In April 2024, the Company received written approval from the Arizona DIFI and the 150 million dividend was distributed in cash to FGH in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 In September 2024, the Company's board of directors approved a 150 million dividend, which was conditioned upon the Company receiving written approval from the Arizona DIFI prior to payment and was not accrued for as of September 30, 2024. The Company subsequently received written approval from the Arizona DIFI and the 150 million extraordinary dividend was distributed in cash to FGH in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023, the Company established a 45 million distribution payable to its parent company, FGH, as a result of updated information regarding certain tax assets related to the acquisition of FLIAC, which resulted in an offsetting reduction to "Additional paid-in capital". The distribution payable was settled during the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Our liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets. Our investment portfolios are integral to the overall liquidity of the Company. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows, including claims. 
 
 Liquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. We continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. 
 
 The principal sources of the Company s liquidity are premiums and certain annuity considerations, investment and fee income, investment maturities, sales of investments, borrowings from its parent and affiliates, and banking relationships through secured or unsecured agreements. The principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends and returns of capital to the parent company, hedging and reinsurance activity and payments in connection with financing activities. 
 
 In managing liquidity, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. We also consider the risk of future collateral requirements under stressed market conditions in respect of the derivatives we utilize.

Table of Contents 

 Liquid Assets 
 
 Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and fixed maturity securities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had liquid assets of 6.1 billion and 6.2 billion, respectively, which includes 1.5 billion of modified coinsurance assets contained within the Ceded business, for each respective period. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the portion of liquid assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was 0.4 billion and 1.0 billion, respectively. 
 
 Intercompany Liquidity Agreement 
 
 FLIAC entered into an intercompany liquidity agreement with FGH that allows the Company to borrow or loans funds of up to 300 million to meet the short-term liquidity and other capital needs of itself and FGH and its affiliates. 
 
 The Company did not borrow or loan any funds under the agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company borrowed a total of 282 million of funds under the agreement, of which 80 million was outstanding at June 30, 2023 but was subsequently repaid in full, plus interest, in July 2023. 
 
 Liquidity Regarding Hedging Activities 
 
 The hedging portion of our risk management strategy for the Retained Business is being managed within the Company. We enter into a range of exchange-traded, cleared, and other OTC derivatives in order to hedge market sensitive exposures against changes in certain capital market risks. The portion of the risk management strategy comprising the hedging portion requires access to liquidity to meet the Company's payment obligations relating to these derivatives, such as payments for periodic settlements, purchases, maturities and terminations. These liquidity needs can vary materially due to, among other items, changes in interest rates, equity markets, mortality, and policyholder behavior. 
 
 The hedging portion of the risk management strategy may also result in derivative-related collateral postings to (when we are in a net pay position) or from (when we are in a net receive position) counterparties. The net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. Depending on market conditions, the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs when we are in a net pay position. 
 
 Secured Borrowing Arrangements 
 
 In the normal course of business, we may enter into repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions with unaffiliated financial institutions, which are typically large or highly rated, to earn spread income and facilitate trading activity. Under these agreements, the Company transfers securities to the counterparty and receives cash as collateral. The cash received is generally invested in short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. 
 
 A liability representing the amount that the securities will be repurchased is recorded in "Liabilities associated with secured borrowing arrangements" in our consolidated statement of financial position. As of September 30, 2024, the liabilities associated with our outstanding repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions were 1,152 million and 6 million, respectively. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in our economic exposure to market risk from December 31, 2023, a description of which may be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, filed with the SEC. See Item 1A, Risk Factors included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a discussion of how difficult conditions in the financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of our operations.

Table of Contents 

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 In order to provide reasonable assurance that the information we must disclose in our filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act Rule 15d-15(e), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
