Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis From time to time, we may be required to measure other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Loans . Loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include collateral dependent loans held for investment. The specific reserves for these loans are based on collateral value, net of estimated disposition costs and other identified quantitative inputs. Collateral value is determined based on independent third-party appraisals or internally-developed discounted cash flow analyses. Internal discounted cash flow analyses are also utilized to estimate the fair value of these loans, which considers internally-developed, unobservable inputs such as discount rates, default rates, and loss severity. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, we measure the impaired loan at nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available, or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price or a discounted cash flow has been used to determine the fair value, we measure the collateral-dependent loan at nonrecurring Level 3. Loans for which an appraised value is not available include commercial loans which are secured by non-real estate assets such as accounts receivable and inventory. To establish fair value for these loans, we apply a recovery factor

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Specific reserves related to these loans totaled thousand and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Real Estate Owned (REO) . The fair value of REO is based on external appraised values that include adjustments for estimated selling costs and assumptions of market conditions that are not directly observable, resulting in a Level 3 classification. The decrease in REO from December 31, 2023 was due to the sale of of the REO properties held at December 31, 2023, resulting in a gain of thousand which is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2024, REO consisted of property which is carried at amortized cost as the appraised value adjusted for estimated selling costs exceeded the amortized cost basis. Mortgage Servicing Rights. When mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in gains on sales of loans. Fair value is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income, resulting in a Level 3 classification. Servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. At September 30, 2024, there was no valuation allowance on the mortgage servicing rights. Significant assumptions in the valuation of these Level 3 mortgage servicing rights as of September 30, 2024, included prepayment rates ranging from to and a discount rate of . Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. The fair value for loans held for sale is based upon a discounted cash flow model which involves estimating the future cash flows from the loans in the portfolio and discounting to a present value. Contractual cash flows associated with the loans are adjusted to reflect certain assumptions, such as prepayment, default, and loss severity assumptions, to form expected prepayment and credit-adjusted expected cash flows. The expected cash flows are then discounted to present value at a rate of return which considers other costs and risks, such as market risk and liquidity. Significant assumptions in the valuation of these Level 3 loans held for sale as of September 30, 2024, included prepayment rates of and for fixed-rate and floating-rate loans, respectively; discount rates ranging from to ; and annual expected loss assumption rate of . Fair Value of Financial Instruments FASB ASC 825-10, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments requires disclosure of the fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate such value. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis are discussed above. The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by management using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies and are based on the exit price notion set forth by ASU 2016-01. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other market value techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. The aggregate fair value amounts presented below do not represent the underlying value of the Company.

 and , respectively and discount rates ranging from to and to , respectively. Investment Securities Held-to-Maturity. Investment securities held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for premiums and discounts that are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity. Investment securities held-to-maturity consist of agency mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities. Fair value is determined based upon the same independent pricing model utilized for valuation of Level 2 investment securities available-for-sale. Investment in Equity Securities. The fair value on investment in equity securities is the carrying amount and is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis. Investment in Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (the FHLB ). As a member, we are required to own stock of the FHLB, the amount of which is based primarily on the level of our borrowings from this institution. Because ownership is restricted, the fair value of the stock is not readily determinable and is therefore equal to the carrying amount, is classified as restricted securities and is periodically evaluated for impairment based on our assessment of the ultimate recoverability of our investments in that stock. Any cash or stock dividends paid to us on such stock are reported as income.

The allowance for credit losses ACL on investment securities is determined for both held-to-maturity and available-for-sale classifications of the investment portfolio in accordance with ASC 326 and is evaluated on a quarterly basis. The ACL for held-to-maturity investment securities is determined on a collective basis, based on shared risk characteristics, and is determined at the individual security level when the Company deems a security to no longer possess shared risk characteristics. Under ASC 326-20, for investment securities where the Company has reason to believe the credit loss exposure is remote, such as those guaranteed by the U.S. government or government sponsored entities, a zero-loss expectation is applied and a company is not required to estimate and recognize an ACL. The ACL related to held-to-maturity investment securities was at September 30, 2024. For securities AFS in an unrealized loss position, the Company first evaluates whether it intends to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. If neither criterion is met, the Company is required to assess whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or noncredit-related factors. In determining whether a security s decline in fair value is credit related, the Company considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: (i) the extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost; (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; (iii) downgrades in credit ratings; (iv) payment structure of the security; and (v) the ability of the issuer of the security to make scheduled principal and interest payments. If, after considering these factors, the present value of expected cash flows to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists, and an allowance for credit loss is recorded through income as a component of provision for credit loss expense. If the assessment indicates that a credit loss does not exist, the Company records the decline in fair value through other comprehensive income (loss), net of related income tax effects. The Company has made the election to exclude accrued interest receivable on securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. On a quarterly basis, the Company engages with an independent third party to perform an analysis of expected credit losses for its municipal and corporate bond securities in order to supplement our own internal review. As of September 30, 2024, the analysis concluded and the Company concurred that corporate bonds were impacted by credit loss, for which thousand was recorded as reversal of provision to the ACL related to available-for-sale securities and that no municipal bond securities were impacted by credit loss. The ACL reserve related to corporate bond securities within the available-for-sale portfolio totaled thousand at September 30, 2024. Charge-offs totaled and million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded total charge-offs of million related to several interest-only strip securities. The ACL related to available-for-sale securities totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The amendments in this ASU eliminate the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables-Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The amendments in this ASU were applied prospectively, and therefore, loan modification and charge off information is provided for only those items occurring after the January 1, 2023 adoption date. Based on the guidance in ASU 2022-02, a loan modification or refinancing results in a new loan if the terms of the new loan are at least as favorable to the lender as the terms with customers with similar collection risks that are not refinancing or restructuring their loans and the modification to the terms of the loan are more than minor. If a loan modification or refinancing does not result in a new loan, it is classified as a loan modification. There are additional disclosures for modification of loans with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that result in a direct change in the timing or amount of contractual cash flows. The disclosures are applicable to situations where there is interest rate reduction, term extensions, principal forgiveness, other-than-insignificant payment delays, or a combination of any of these items.

 million in small homogeneous loan portfolios or of the total blended portfolio evaluated using historical loss factors. Pooled loan segments consisted of multifamily, commercial, single-family, non-owner occupied commercial real estate, and construction loans. The remaining portion of the loan portfolio, representing million or approximately of the total blended loan portfolio, consisted of small homogeneous loan portfolios which has its quantitative reserve calculated separately based on historical loss factors for the respective portfolios or, if no historical loss is available, based on peer group historical losses. These loan portfolios include equipment finance, land, consumer and commercial small balance loans. In addition, collateral dependent loans are separately valued based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. The measurement also incorporates qualitative components such as internal and external risk factors that may not be adequately assessed in the quantitative model. Qualitative adjustments primarily relate to segments of the loan portfolio deemed by management to be of a higher-risk profile or other factors where management believes the quantitative component of the ACL model may not be fully reflective of levels deemed adequate in the judgment of management. Qualitative adjustments may also relate to uncertainty as to future macroeconomic conditions and the related impact on certain loan segments. Management reviews the need for an appropriate level of quantitative adjustments on a quarterly basis, and as such, the amount and allocation of qualitative adjustments may change in future periods. Management applies a two-year time horizon in its ACL model at which there is a gradual reversion back to historical loss experience. For purposes of calculating the ACL, the Company has elected to include deferred loan fees and expenses in the loan balance and exclude accrued interest from loan balances.

 Commercial real estate loans Commercial loans Total December 31, 2023: Loans secured by real estate: Commercial real estate loans Commercial loans Total Credit Risk Management The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis typically includes larger, non-homogeneous loans such as loans secured by multifamily or commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. This analysis is performed on an ongoing basis as new information is obtained. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Pass: Loans classified as pass are strong credits with no existing or known potential weaknesses deserving of management s close attention. Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans listed as pass include larger non-homogeneous loans not meeting the risk rating definitions above and smaller, homogeneous loans not assessed on an individual basis.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends in our businesses that accounted for the changes in our results of operations in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to our results of operations in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023; and our financial condition at September 30, 2024 as compared to our financial condition at December 31, 2023. This discussion and analysis is based on and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report and our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the notes thereto, which are set forth in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K which we filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. Forward-Looking Statements Statements contained in this report that are not historical facts or that discuss our expectations, beliefs or views regarding our future financial performance or future financial condition, or financial or other trends in our business or in the markets in which we operate, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Often, they include words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, plan, estimate, project, outlook or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could, or may. Such forward-looking statements are based on current information that is available to us, and on assumptions that we make, about future events or economic or financial conditions or trends over which we do not have control. In addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. As a result of those risks and uncertainties, our actual financial results in the future could differ, possibly materially, from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and could cause us to make changes to our future plans. The principal risks and uncertainties to which our businesses are subject are discussed in this Item 2 and under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Therefore, you are urged to read not only the information contained in this Item 2, but also the risk factors and other cautionary information contained under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which qualify the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Also, our actual results in the future may differ from those currently expected due to additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not currently aware or which we do not currently view as, but in the future may become, material to our business or operating results. Due to these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this report and not to make predictions about our future financial performance based solely on our historical financial performance. We also disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this report or in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except as may otherwise be required by applicable law or government regulations. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and accounting practices in the banking industry. Certain of those accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies because they require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could materially affect the value of those assets, such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our loans or ultimately realize the carrying value of certain of our other assets. Those estimates and assumptions are made based on current information available to us regarding those economic conditions or trends or other circumstances. If changes were to occur in the events, trends or other circumstances on which our estimates or assumptions were based, or other unanticipated events were to occur that might affect our operations, we may be required under GAAP to adjust our earlier estimates and to reduce the carrying values of the affected assets on our balance sheet, generally by means of charges against income, which could also affect our results of operations in the fiscal periods when those charges are recognized. Management has identified

 our most critical accounting policies and accounting estimates as: allowance for credit losses investment securities, allowance for credit losses loans, and deferred income taxes. Allowance for Credit Losses Investment Securities The ACL on investment securities is determined for both held-to-maturity and available-for-sale classifications of the investment portfolio in accordance with ASC 326 and is evaluated on a quarterly basis. The ACL for held-to-maturity investment securities is determined on a collective basis, based on shared risk characteristics, and is determined at the individual security level when we deem a security to no longer possess shared risk characteristics. Under ASC 326-20, for investment securities where we have reason to believe the credit loss exposure is remote, such as those guaranteed by the U.S. government or government sponsored entities, a zero-loss expectation is applied, and a company is not required to estimate and recognize an ACL. For securities available-for-sale AFS in an unrealized loss position, we first evaluate whether we intend to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. If neither criterion is met, we are required to assess whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or noncredit-related factors. In determining whether a security s decline in fair value is credit related, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to: (i) the extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost; (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; (iii) downgrades in credit ratings; (iv) payment structure of the security; and (v) the ability of the issuer of the security to make scheduled principal and interest payments. If, after considering these factors, the present value of expected cash flows to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists, and an allowance for credit loss is recorded through income as a component of provision for credit loss expense. If the assessment indicates that a credit loss does not exist, we record the decline in fair value through other comprehensive income, net of related income tax effects. We have elected to exclude accrued interest receivable on securities from the estimate of credit losses and report accrued interest separately on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a security is confirmed or when either of the criterion regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. See Note 3: Securities in the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our allowance for credit losses on securities AFS. Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans . Our ACL for loans is established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense and may be reduced by a recapture of previously established loss reserves, which are also reflected in the statement of income. Loans are charged against the ACL when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely. The ACL for loans is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible based on an evaluation of the collectability of loans and prior loan loss experience. This evaluation also takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, current economic conditions and certain other subjective factors that may affect the borrower s ability to pay. While we use the best information available to make this evaluation, future adjustments to our ACL may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic or other conditions that can affect the collectability in full of loans in our loan portfolios. See Note 5: Allowance for Credit Losses , in the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the Company s allowance for credit losses on loans. Deferred Income Taxes. We record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet an amount equal to the tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions (collectively tax benefits that we believe will be available to us to offset or reduce income taxes in future periods. Under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations, tax benefits related to tax loss carryforwards may expire if they cannot be used within specified periods of time. Accordingly, the ability to fully use our deferred tax asset related to tax loss carryforwards to reduce income taxes in the future depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate during those time periods. At least once each year, or more frequently, if warranted, we make estimates of future taxable income that we believe we are likely to generate during those future periods. If we conclude, on the basis of those estimates and the amount of the tax benefits available to us, that it is more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration, we recognize the deferred tax asset in full on our balance sheet. On the other hand, if we were to conclude on the basis of those estimates and the amount of the tax benefits available to us that it has become more likely than not that we will be unable to utilize those tax benefits in full prior to their expiration, then we would establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance

 sheet to the amount with respect to which we believe it is still more likely than not that we will be able to use to offset or reduce taxes in the future. The establishment of such a valuation allowance, or any change in an existing valuation allowance, would be effectuated through the provision for income taxes for the period in which such valuation allowance is established or changed. For complete discussion and disclosure of other accounting policies, see Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Company s consolidated financial statements in both this quarterly filing as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We have two business segments, Banking and Investment Management and Wealth Planning Wealth Management ). Banking includes the operations of FFB, FFIS, FFPF, and Blue Moon Management LLC and Wealth Management includes the operations of FFA. The financial position and operating results of the stand-alone holding company, FFI, are included under the caption Other in certain of the tables that follow, along with any consolidation elimination entries. Overview and Recent Developments For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of 82.2 million, compared to net income of 3.1 million for the prior quarter and net income of 2.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. In comparison to the prior quarter, current quarter results were impacted primarily by the recording of a 117.5 million Lower of Cost or Market LOCOM adjustment, resulting from the reclassification of a portion of the multifamily loan portfolio totaling 1.9 billion in principal balance from loans held for investment to loans held for sale. Loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and as a result, the LOCOM adjustment, equating to 93.8 fair-value pricing, was recorded to earnings in the quarter. The reclassification is intended to provide the Company with flexibility as it explores its options for securitizing or selling the loans and maximizing final execution pricing. Offsetting the LOCOM adjustment, the Company reported an increase in net interest income after provision for credit losses of 4.2 million or 9.4 compared to the prior quarter, as increases in interest income earned on interest-earning assets offset relatively smaller increases in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income after provision for credit losses totaled 48.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 44.6 million for the prior quarter and 54.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin NIM increased to 1.50 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.36 for the prior quarter. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 the Company recorded provision for credit losses of 282 thousand, compared to a reversal of provision of 806 thousand in the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses recorded in the current quarter was a return to levels normally recorded following the prior quarter s reversal. The ACL related to loans held for investment totaled 29.3 million, relatively unchanged from the prior quarter. The coverage ratio of ACL to total loans held for investment increased from 29 basis points in the prior quarter to 36 basis points in the current quarter. The increase reflects certain adjustments made to the qualitative reserve which updated adjustments for the repricing and interest rate risks in the multifamily portfolio, the potential risk associated with substandard loans not impaired and potential impact of continued high interest rates on the business and retail loan portfolios. Consideration for credit risk on the loans held for sale portfolio is considered in the fair value instead of the ACL. Noninterest income, excluding the 117.5 million LOCOM adjustment, totaled 11.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.7 million for the prior quarter. Noninterest expense totaled 60.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 55.6 million for the prior quarter. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of 34.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 421 thousand for the prior quarter. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total assets of 13.4 billion, including 8.1 billion of loans held for investment, net of deferred fees and allowance for credit losses, 1.8 billion in loans held for sale, net of deferred fees, 1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, 1.3 billion in investment securities available-for-sale, and 0.7 billion in investment securities held-to-maturity. This compares to total assets of 13.3 billion, including 10.1 billion of total loans held for investment, net of deferred fees and allowance for credit losses, 1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, 0.8 billion in investment securities held-to-maturity, and 0.7 billion in investment securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents represented approximately 8.3 of total assets at September 30, 2024, compared to 10 of total assets at December 31, 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, total assets increased 49.3 million or 0.4 , largely due to an increase in securities available-for-sale which increased 0.6 billion, resulting 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 from 1.8 billion in new security purchases offset by 1.3 billion in sales and maturities, offset by decreases in total loans and other asset categories. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total liabilities of 12.3 billion, including 10.3 billion in deposits, 1.7 billion in borrowings, and 173 million in subordinated debt. This compares to total liabilities of 12.4 billion, including 10.7 billion in deposits, 1.4 billion in borrowings, and 173 million in subordinated debt at December 31, 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, total liabilities decreased 95.1 million or 0.8 . The decrease in total liabilities is due primarily to a 0.4 billion decrease in deposits, offset by a 0.3 billion increase in borrowings. The decrease in deposits was the result of decreases in interest-bearing demand accounts and certificates of deposit, offset by increases in noninterest-bearing demand accounts and money market and savings accounts. The increase in borrowings was primarily due to the addition of 500 million in FHLB advances offset by a 178 million paydown of Federal Reserve Bank advances. Borrowings as a percentage of total assets equaled 12.6 at September 30, 2024, compared to 10.6 of total assets at December 31, 2023. Our loan to deposit ratio was 95.9 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 95.2 as of December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total shareholders equity of 1.1 billion, compared to 925.3 million at December 31, 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, total shareholders equity increased 144.5 million or 15.6 . The increase in shareholders equity was largely due to the aforementioned July 2024 Capital Raise, which consisted of 228 million gross proceeds less 13.5 million in issuance costs, resulting in net proceeds of 214.5 million. In addition, the Company reported an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of 8.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, largely due to an increase in unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale investment securities, offset by an unrealized loss on the cash flow hedge during the period. The additional capital and increase in accumulated other comprehensive income were offset by the net loss of 78.3 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, and by 1.1 million in fourth quarter 2023 and first quarter 2024 dividends paid to shareholders. Results of Operations The primary sources of revenue for Banking are net interest income, fees from its deposits and trust services, gains on the sale of loans and investment securities available-for-sale, certain loan fees, and consulting fees. The primary sources of revenue for Wealth Management are asset management fees assessed on the balance of assets under management AUM ).

Combined net loss before income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 was 117.0 million, compared to combined net income before taxes of 1.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. The 118.6 million decrease in combined net income before taxes from the year-ago quarter was primarily due to a decrease in net income before taxes in the Banking segment of 115.6 million, resulting primarily from the LHFS LOCOM adjustment of 117.5 million associated with the transfer of 1.9 billion in multifamily loans from loans held for investment to loans held for sale. Net interest income decreased 3.0 million from the year-ago quarter. Interest income increased 12.4 million or 8.6 from the year-ago quarter but was offset by an increase in interest expense of 15.3 million or 16.6 from the year-ago quarter. Net interest income, noninterest income, and noninterest expense are discussed in more detail in the tables that follow. The decrease in Wealth Management net income before taxes of 0.3 million was primarily due to a 0.5 million increase in noninterest expense, offset by an 0.2 million increase in noninterest income. Provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses represents our estimate of the amount necessary to be charged against the current period s earnings to maintain the ACL for loans and investments at a level that we consider adequate in relation to the estimated losses inherent in the loan and investment portfolios. The provision for credit losses for loans is impacted by changes in loan balances as well as changes in estimated loss assumptions and charge-offs and recoveries. The amount of the provision for loans also takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, current economic conditions and certain other subjective factors that may affect the ability of borrowers to meet their repayment obligations to us. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 0.3 million, compared to a reversal of provision expense of 2.0 million for the year-ago quarter. The third quarter s provision consisted primarily of additions to the ACL for the loans held for investment portfolio and unused commitments, offset slightly by a decrease in provision related to investment securities. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net charge-offs of 0.3 million,

Combined net loss before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 114.4 million, compared to combined net loss before taxes of 200.3 million for the year-ago period. The combined net losses in both periods were largely due to nonrecurring items, in particular the 117.5 million LOCOM adjustment in 2024, and the 215.3 million goodwill impairment charge in 2023. Excluding these items, combined net income before taxes would have been 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.9 million for the year-ago period. The 11.8 million decrease in adjusted combined net income before taxes from the year-ago period was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income of 28.5 million, offset by a 2.8 million increase in noninterest income and a 14.6 million decrease in noninterest expense. The decrease in net interest income from the year-ago period was due to an increase in interest expense primarily due to increases in interest expense associated with deposits, offset by an increase in interest income. Interest income increased 31.4 million or 7.4 from the year-ago period but was offset by an increase in interest expense of 59.9 million or 22.4 from the year-ago period. Net interest income, noninterest income, and noninterest expense are discussed in more detail in the tables that follow. The increase in Wealth Management net income before taxes of 0.4 million was primarily due to an increase in noninterest income of 0.6 million, offset by a 0.2 million increase in noninterest expense. Provision for credit losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 53 thousand, compared to a reversal of provision expense of 0.7 million in the year-ago period. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on the loans held for investment portfolio totaled 29.3 million, compared to 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 29.2 million at December 31, 2024. The coverage ratio of ACL to total loans held for investment increased from 29 basis points in the prior quarter to 36 basis points in the current quarter. The increase reflects certain adjustments made to the qualitative reserve which updated adjustments for the repricing and interest rate risks in the multifamily portfolio, the potential risk associated with substandard loans not impaired and potential impact of continued high interest rates on the business and retail loan portfolios. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we recorded net charge-offs of 0.8 million, or 0.01 of average loans on an annualized basis compared to 2.5 million or 0.03 of average loans on an annualized basis in the year-ago period. Net Interest Income. The principal component of the Company s earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments (interest-earning assets) and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds (interest-bearing liabilities). Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin. The net interest rate spread is the yield on average interest-earning assets minus the cost of average interest-earning liabilities. Our net interest income, net interest rate spread, and net interest margin are sensitive to general business and economic conditions. We manage net interest income through affecting changes in the mix of interest-earning assets as well as the mix of interest-bearing liabilities, changes in the level of interest-bearing liabilities in proportion to interest-earning assets, and the growth and maturity of earning assets. For further discussion on our interest rate risk management practices, see Interest Rate Risk Management within this Item 2.

The overall decrease in net interest income from the year-ago period was primarily driven by rates on interest-bearing liabilities increasing faster than rates on interest-earning assets, and average interest-bearing liability balances increasing more than those of average interest-earning assets. Interest income increased to 157.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 144.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in interest income was due to an increase in average yield earned on interest-earning assets, as well as an increase in average interest-earning asset balances. Yields on interest-earning assets averaged 4.75 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.56 for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 19 basis points. Average interest-earning asset balances increased 4.4 to 13.2 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 12.6 billion for the third quarter of 2023. Yields on the loan portfolio increased to 4.77 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.73 for the third quarter of 2023, while average balances decreased to 10.1 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to average balances of 10.5 billion for the third quarter of 2023. New loan fundings totaled 366 million at an average yield of 8.23 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to new loan fundings of 244.6 million at an average yield of 8.35 for the third quarter of 2023. Yields on the combined AFS and HTM securities portfolio increased to 4.23 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.24 for the third quarter of 2023, while combined average balances increased to 2.0 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to combined average balances of 1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in combined average balances was due to the acquisition of higher-yielding and highly liquid AFS securities, primarily agency mortgage-backed securities. Interest expense increased to 108.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 92.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to increases in both average interest-bearing liability balances as well as average rates paid on such balances. Average interest-bearing liability balances, consisting of interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and subordinated debt, increased 10.5 to 10.1 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 9.2 billion for the third quarter of 2023. Rates on interest-bearing liability balances averaged 4.27 for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 3.97 for the second quarter of 2023. Rates on interest-bearing liability balances increased primarily due to an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, which averaged 4.29 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.00 for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 29 basis points. Rates on interest-bearing deposits increased from the year-ago period due to market competition for deposits which has driven rates paid to higher levels, as well as client migration from noninterest-bearing demand accounts to higher-rate money market, and higher-yielding savings accounts.

Net interest income was 131.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30 2024, compared to 159.8 million for the year-ago period. The overall decrease in net interest income from the year-ago period was primarily driven by rates on interest-bearing liabilities increasing faster than rates on interest-earning assets, and average interest-bearing liability balances increasing at a higher rate than those of average interest-earning assets. Interest income increased to 458.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 427.1 million for the year-ago period. The increase in interest income was due to increases in both average interest-earning asset balances as well as average yield earned on such balances. Average interest-earning asset balances increased 2.0 to 13.0 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.8 billion for the year-ago period.

New loan fundings totaled 1.2 billion at an average yield of 8.25 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to new loan fundings of 1.2 billion at an average yield of 7.79 for the year-ago period. Yields on the combined AFS and HTM securities portfolio increased to 4.10 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.79 for the year-ago period, while combined average balances increased to 1.9 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to combined average balances of 1.2 billion for the year-ago period. The increase in combined average balances was due to the acquisition of higher-yielding and highly liquid AFS securities, primarily agency mortgage-backed securities. Interest expense increased to 327.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 267.3 million for the year-ago period. The increase in interest expense was due to increases in both average interest-bearing liability balances as well as average rates paid on such balances. Average interest-bearing liability balances, consisting of interest-bearing deposits, borrowings, and subordinated debt, increased 9.6 to 10.3 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.4 billion for the year-ago period. Rates on interest-bearing liability balances averaged 4.25 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.80 for the year-ago period. Rates on interest-bearing liability balances increased primarily due to an increase in rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, which averaged 4.29 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.65 for the year-ago period, an increase of 64 basis points. Rates on interest-bearing deposits increased due to market competition for deposits which has driven rates paid to higher levels, as well as client migration from noninterest-bearing demand accounts to higher-rate money market and higher-yielding savings accounts. Average rates paid on borrowings decreased to 4.08 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.86 for the year-ago period, while average borrowings increased to 1.5 billion for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.2 billion for the year-ago period. Average rates paid on borrowings for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased as the composition of borrowings changed from primarily higher-rate short-term FHLB advances in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to predominately lower-rate FHLB putable advances during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024.

The 4.8 million decrease in noninterest expense was largely due to the 5.7 million decrease in customer service costs, offset by a 0.9 million increase in professional services and marketing expense. The decrease in customer service costs was due to a decrease in the average balances of depository accounts receiving earnings credits as well as a decrease in the average rates paid on such accounts. The increase in professional services and marketing expense was largely due to professional services associated with prior quarters activities as well as the shareholder meeting following the July 2024 Capital Raise. Noninterest expense in Wealth Management was 5.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 5.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due primarily to a 0.3 million increase in compensation and benefits expense, primarily due to higher commission expense.

 Noninterest expense in Banking was 147.0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 375.6 million for the year-ago period. The 228.6 million decrease in noninterest expense was largely due to the 215.3 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in June 2023. Excluding this one-time charge, operating noninterest expense totaled 160.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The 13.3 million decrease in operating noninterest expense was largely due to a 14.6 million decrease in customer service costs, and a 6.8 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs, offset by a 7.1 million increase in other expense and a 1.3 million increase in professional services and marketing expense. The decrease in customer service costs was due to a decrease in the average balances of depository accounts receiving earnings credits as well as a decrease in the rates paid on such balances in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the year-ago period. The decrease in compensation and benefit costs was primarily due to decreased staffing levels during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to levels during the year-ago period. Average Banking FTEs were 492.3 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 551.2 for the year-ago period. Staffing levels were reduced in the first and second quarters of 2023 and have remained at reduced levels due to efforts to maximize efficiency and contain costs. The increase in other expense was due largely to a 6.2 million increase in FDIC insurance costs in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the year-ago period. The increase in professional services and marketing was largely attributable to increases in external accounting and information technology and infrastructure expenses. Noninterest expense in Wealth Management was 17.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 17.0 million for the year-ago period. The 0.1 million increase in noninterest expense in Wealth Management was largely due to slight increase in professional services and marketing expense, offset by a slight decrease in compensation and benefits expense. Average Wealth Management FTEs were 63.2 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.2 for the year-ago period.

 Our consolidated balance sheet is primarily affected by changes occurring in our Banking operations as our Wealth Management operations do not maintain significant levels of assets. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, total assets increased by 49.3 million primarily due to increases in investment securities, offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and total loans. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, total liabilities decreased by 95.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in deposits, offset by an increase in borrowings. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, total shareholders equity increased 144.5 million primarily due to net proceeds of 214.5 million received from the July 2024 Capital Raise and 8.7 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income largely due to an increase in unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities, offset by net loss of 78.3 million and a 1.1 million fourth quarter 2023 and first quarter 2024 dividends paid to shareholders. For additional information on the changes in total assets, liabilities, and shareholders equity, see Overview and Recent Developments within this Item 2. Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank or at correspondent banks, including fed funds, decreased by 220.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023.

 Delinquent Loans, Nonperforming Assets and Provision for Credit Losses Loans are considered past due following the date when either interest or principal is contractually due and unpaid. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. Accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when reasonable doubt exists as to the full, timely collection of interest or principal and, generally, when a loan becomes contractually past due for 90 days or more with respect to principal or interest. However, the accrual of interest may be continued on a well-secured loan contractually past due 90 days or more with respect to principal or interest if the loan is in the process of collection or collection of the principal and interest is deemed probable. The following tables provide a summary of past due and nonaccrual loans as of:

 The 24.9 million increase in total past due and nonaccrual loans from 42.5 million at December 31, 2023 to 67.4 million at September 30, 2024 was largely due to two residential loans totaling 19.2 million to the same high net worth individual, both of which are well secured by the borrower s net worth and value of the collateral. The loan delinquency on one of these loans was cured shortly after September 30, 2024, and the other loan s delinquency is expected to be cured during the next quarter, therefore no specific provision was deemed necessary, however adjustments to the qualitative factors within the CECL model were made to reflect the increase in past due and nonaccrual loans.

Our ACL for loans held for investment represented

Table of Contents 
 0.36 of total loans held for investment outstanding as of September 30, 2024, 0.28 of total loans held for investment outstanding as of September 30, 2023, and 0.29 of total loans held for investment outstanding at December 31, 2023. Activity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 included a provision for credit losses of 0.9 million, charge-offs of 1.2 million, and recoveries of 0.4 million. Under the CECL methodology, for which our ACL for loans is based, estimates of expected credit losses over the life of a loan are determined and utilized considering the effect of various major factors. The major factors considered in evaluating losses are historical charge-off experience, delinquency rates, local and national economic conditions, the borrower s ability to repay the loan and timing of repayments, and the value of any related collateral. Management s estimate of fair value of the collateral considers current and anticipated future real estate market conditions, thereby causing these estimates to be particularly susceptible to changes that could result in a material adjustment to results of operations in the future. Provisions for credit losses are charged to operations based on management s evaluation of estimated losses in its loan portfolio. In addition, the FDIC and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, as integral parts of their examination processes, periodically review the adequacy of our ACL. These agencies may require us to make additional provisions for credit losses, over and above the provisions that we have already made, the effect of which would be to reduce our income. Liquidity Liquidity management focuses on our ability to generate, on a timely and cost-effective basis, cash sufficient to meet the funding needs of current loan demand, deposit withdrawals, principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and to pay operating expenses. Liquidity management also includes the ability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources, as well as abnormal and unexpected needs. To meet such abnormal and unexpected needs, lines of credit are maintained with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank, and correspondent banks. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of funds management. Liquidity management takes into consideration liquid assets, which includes: cash and cash equivalents; unencumbered eligible investment securities; and investment securities pledged under the Federal Reserve Bank s discount window and BTFP programs which can be drawn at-will. Liquidity management also takes into consideration available liquidity sources such as available unused funds from both the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank credit lines. The Bank s Federal Reserve Bank credit line is secured by pledged collateral in the form of qualifying loans and investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had secured unused borrowing capacity of 823 million under this agreement. The Bank s unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB as of September 30, 2024 was 2.0 billion. The Bank had a total of 240 million in unused borrowing capacity available through its correspondent bank lines of credit as of September 30, 2024. We monitor our liquidity in accordance with guidelines established by our Board of Directors and applicable regulatory requirements. Our need for liquidity is affected by our loan activity, net changes in deposit levels and the maturities of our borrowings. The principal sources of our liquidity consist of deposits, loan interest and principal payments and prepayments, investment management and consulting fees, proceeds from borrowings, and sales of FFI common stock. The remaining balances of the Bank s lines of credit available to draw down totaled 3.0 billion at September 30, 2024. We believe our liquid assets and available liquidity sources are sufficient to meet current funding needs and that we have the ability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources, as well as abnormal and unexpected needs. We regularly monitor liquidity to ensure levels are in compliance with minimum requirements established by our Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2024, our available liquidity ratio was 49.1 , which is above our minimum policy requirement of 25 . We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that adequate liquidity is available, and have contingency funding plans in place, which are reviewed and tested on a regular, recurring basis. Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, operating activities provided net cash of 12.3 million. Changes in accrued interest receivable and other assets as well as changes in accounts payable and other liabilities accounted for most of the cash flows provided by operating activities.

Table of Contents 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, investing activities used net cash of 343.8 million, primarily due to 515.7 million in purchases of securities, net of sales and maturities, offset by a 173.7 million net decrease in loans. Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, financing activities provided net cash of 111.3 million, consisting primarily of a net increase of 321.6 million in FHLB and FRB advances, and 214.5 million in net proceeds received from the July 2024 Capital Raise, offset by a decrease of 384.3 million in deposits, and a decrease of 39.2 million in repurchase agreements. Ratio of Loans to Deposits. The relationship between gross loans and total deposits can provide a useful measure of a bank s liquidity. Since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources, the higher the loan-to-deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets. On the other hand, since we realize greater yields on loans than we do on other interest-earning assets, a lower loan-to-deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings. As a result, our goal is to achieve a loan-to-deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on our assets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the loan-to-deposit ratios at FFB were 95.9 , and 95.2 , respectively. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table provides the off-balance sheet arrangements of the Company as of September 30, 2024: 

(dollars in thousands) Commitments to fund under existing loans, lines of credit 1,095,155 Commitments under standby letters of credit 38,471 Some of the commitments to fund existing loans, lines of credit and letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024, FFB was obligated on 10 million of letters of credit to the FHLB which were being used as collateral for public fund deposits. Interest Rate Risk Management Interest rate risk IRR refers to the vulnerability of an institution s financial condition to movements in interest rates. Excessive IRR poses a significant threat to an institution s earnings and capital. Changes in interest rates affect an institution s earnings by altering interest-sensitive income and expenses. Changes in interest rates also affect the underlying value of an institutions assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments because the present value of future cash flows (and in some cases, the cash flows themselves) change when interest rates change. The Board of Directors of the Bank has adopted a policy to govern the management of the Bank s exposure to IRR. This policy is an integral part of the Bank s overall asset/liability management. The goals of this policy are to (1) optimize profits through the management of IRR; (2) limit the exposure of the Bank s earnings and capital to fluctuations in interest rates; and (3) ensure that the Bank s management of IRR meets applicable regulatory guidelines. We assess our interest rate exposure within our major balance sheet categories individually, as well as in our balance sheet holistically, focusing on the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. Our processes identify potential areas of vulnerability, particularly those influenced by fluctuations in market interest rates. Our IRR assessment process considers the repricing and liquidity characteristics of various financial instruments, including loans, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings. We establish a desired risk profile that aligns with our strategic goals and the prevailing interest rate environment. This profile considers factors such as the mix of fixed and floating rate assets and liabilities, taking into account our outlook on interest rates. We set clear policy limits and guidelines that guide our IRR management strategies, consistent with regulatory guidance. We employ various strategies to mitigate IRR by managing our asset and liability mix, including adjusting the duration of our assets to align with our liabilities. Our IRR management process is dynamic and includes regular monitoring and review. Our management team conducts ongoing assessments of asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics, ensuring they remain consistent with our desired risk profile.

 By proactively identifying, assessing, and managing IRR, we aim to maintain the stability of our financial performance, protect interests of our stakeholders, and ensure our continued ability to meet the financial needs of our customers. The following table sets forth the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on the basis of when they reprice or mature as of September 30, 2024: 

Less than From 1 to From 3 to (dollars in thousands) 1 year 3 Years 5 Years Over 5 Years Total Interest-earnings assets: Cash equivalents 1,106,172 1,106,172 Securities, FHLB stock 647,327 387,967 253,333 751,353 2,039,980 Loans, including LHFS 4,489,482 3,327,389 1,111,806 747,402 9,676,079 Interest-bearing liabilities: Deposits: Interest-bearing checking (2,204,141) (708,265) (125,856) (27,650) (3,065,912) Money market and savings (2,235,933) (1,090,662) (179,920) (37,672) (3,544,187) Certificates of deposit (1,516,783) (909,126) (371,584) (4) (2,797,497) Borrowings (291,452) (300,000) (1,100,000) (1,691,452) Net: Current Period (5,328) 707,303 (412,221) 1,433,429 1,723,183 Net: Cumulative (5,328) 701,975 289,754 1,723,183 The cumulative positive total of 1.7 billion reflects the funding provided by noninterest-bearing deposits and equity. Because we had a 5 million net negative position at September 30, 2024 for the repricing period of less than one year, the result of this analysis indicates that we would be adversely impacted by a short-term increase in interest rates and would be similarly positively impacted from a short-term decrease in interest rates. However, the extent to which our net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates will depend on a number of factors, including how quickly interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities react to interest rate changes. It is not uncommon for rates on certain assets or liabilities to lag behind changes in the market rates of interest. Additionally, prepayments of loans and early withdrawals of certificates of deposit could cause interest sensitivities to vary. As a result, the relationship or gap between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as shown in the above table, is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity and the effect of changing rates of interest on our net interest income is likely to be different from that predicted solely on the basis of the interest rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the above table. Our IRR position is regularly measured using two methods: (i) Net Interest Income NII and (ii) Economic Value of Equity EVE ). Consistent with regulatory requirements, the Bank has established Board of Directors-approved IRR limits for NII simulations and EVE calculations. These analyses are reviewed quarterly by the Asset/Liability Committee and the Board of Directors. If the analyses project changes which are outside our pre-established IRR limits, we may: (i) revise existing limits to address the changes in the Bank s IRR, with the recommended limits being prudent and consistent with the Board s risk tolerance; or (ii) retain the existing limits and implement a plan for an orderly return to compliance with these limits, where corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, restructuring the maturity profile of the Bank s investment portfolio, changing deposit pricing, initiating off-balance sheet hedging actions, or adjusting the repricing characteristics of the loan portfolios.

 The NII simulation is used to measure and evaluate potential changes in our net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates. The model measures the impact over a range of instantaneous shocks in 100 basis points increments to our net interest income over a 12-months forecast period. The Board-approved limits on NII sensitivity and the actual computed changes to our NII based on the +/- 100 and +/- 200 basis points hypothetical interest rate scenarios as of September 30, 2024 are shown below: 

Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Net Assumed Instantaneous Change in Interest Rates Interest Income Board Limits + 100 basis points (5.92) (20.00) + 200 basis points (14.12) (25.00) - 100 basis points 0.98 (10.00) - 200 basis points 1.92 (20.00) The modeled one-year NII results indicate that the Bank is more earnings sensitive in the rising rate shock scenarios of 100 through 200 basis points. The NII modeled results above are in compliance with the IRR limits. The EVE measures the sensitivity of our market value equity to simultaneous changes in interest rates. EVE is derived by subtracting the economic value of the Bank s liabilities from the economic value of its assets, assuming current and hypothetical interest rate environments. EVE is based on all of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the Bank s current balance sheet, discounted to derive the economic value of the Bank s assets and liabilities. These cash flows may change depending on the assumed interest rate environment and the resulting changes in other assumptions, such as prepayment speeds. The Bank has established IRR limits which specify the maximum EVE sensitivity allowed under current interest rates and for a range of hypothetical interest rate scenarios each in 100 basis point increments. The hypothetical scenarios are represented by immediate, permanent, parallel movements in the term structure of interest rates. The Board-approved limits on EVE sensitivity and the actual computed changes to our EVE based on the +/- 100 and +/- 200 basis points hypothetical interest rate scenarios as of September 30, 2024 are shown below: 

Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Economic Assumed Instantaneous Change in Interest Rates Value of Equity Board Limits + 100 basis points 1.53 (15.00) + 200 basis points 0.14 (25.00) - 100 basis points (6.56) (15.00) - 200 basis points (13.42) (20.00) The results of the EVE are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted. These could include, but are not limited to, non-parallel yield curve shifts, changes in market interest rate spreads and the actual reaction to changes in interest rate levels of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It is not uncommon for rates on certain assets or liabilities to lag behind changes in the market rates of interest. Additionally, prepayments of loans and early withdrawals of certificates of deposit could cause interest sensitivities to vary. The EVE modeled results above are in compliance with the EVE limits. The EVE is an interest rate risk management tool, and the results are not necessarily an indication of our actual future results. Actual results may vary significantly from the results suggested by the table above. Loan prepayments and deposit attrition, changes in our mix of earning assets or funding sources, and future asset/liability management decisions, among others, may vary significantly from our assumptions. The results of these analyses and simulations do not contemplate all of the actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. In response to actual or anticipated changes in interest rates, we have various alternatives for managing and reducing the Bank s exposure to interest rate risk, such as entering into hedges and obtaining long-term fixed-rate FHLB advances.

 We believe our IRR management policy limits are consistent with prevailing practice in the regional banking industry. Capital Resources and Dividend Policy The capital rules applicable to United States based bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions Capital Rules require the Company (on a consolidated basis) and FFB (on a stand-alone basis) to meet specific capital adequacy requirements that, for the most part, involve quantitative measures, primarily in terms of the ratios of their capital to their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items, calculated under regulatory accounting practices. For additional information regarding these Capital Rules, see Item 1 Business Capital Requirements Applicable to Banks and Bank Holding Companies included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, prompt corrective action regulations place a federally insured depository institution, such as FFB, into one of five capital categories on the basis of its capital ratios: (i) well-capitalized; (ii) adequately capitalized; (iii) undercapitalized; (iv) significantly undercapitalized; or (v) critically undercapitalized. A depository institution s primary federal regulatory agency may determine that, based on certain qualitative assessments, the depository institution should be assigned to a lower capital category than the one indicated by its capital ratios. At each successive lower capital category, a depository institution is subject to greater operating restrictions and increased regulatory supervision by its federal bank regulatory agency. The following table sets forth the capital and capital ratios of FFI (on a consolidated basis) and FFB as of the respective dates indicated below, as compared to the respective regulatory requirements applicable to them: 

To Be Well Capitalized For Capital Under Prompt Corrective Actual Adequacy Purposes Action Provisions (dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio FFI September 30, 2024: Common equity tier 1 ratio 896,254 10.31 391,055 4.50 Leverage ratio 1,026,506 7.64 537,589 4.00 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 8,690,105 11.81 521,406 6.00 Total risk-based capital ratio 8,690,105 14.21 695,208 8.00 December 31, 2023: Common equity tier 1 ratio 931,272 10.02 418,142 4.50 Leverage ratio 931,272 7.20 517,033 4.00 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 931,272 10.02 557,523 6.00 Total risk-based capital ratio 1,140,312 12.27 743,363 8.00 FFB September 30, 2024: Common equity tier 1 ratio 1,160,564 13.41 389,497 4.50 562,606 6.50 Leverage ratio 1,160,564 8.65 536,475 4.00 670,594 5.00 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 1,160,564 13.41 519,329 6.00 692,438 8.00 Total risk-based capital ratio 1,195,624 13.81 692,438 8.00 865,548 10.00 December 31, 2023: Common equity tier 1 ratio 1,076,337 11.62 416,684 4.50 601,877 6.50 Leverage ratio 1,076,337 8.35 515,753 4.00 644,691 5.00 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 1,076,337 11.62 555,579 6.00 740,772 8.00 Total risk-based capital ratio 1,111,979 12.01 740,772 8.00 925,965 10.00

 As of each of the dates set forth in the above table, the Company exceeded the minimum required capital ratios applicable to it and FFB s capital ratios exceeded the minimums necessary to qualify as a well-capitalized depository institution under the prompt corrective action regulations. The required ratios for capital adequacy set forth in the above table do not include the Capital Rules additional capital conservation buffer, though each of the Company and FFB maintained capital ratios necessary to satisfy the capital conservation buffer requirements as of the dates indicated. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of capital at FFB in excess of amounts required to be well capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations was 598 million for the common equity tier 1 ratio, 490 million for the leverage ratio, 468 million for the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and 330 million for the total risk-based capital ratio. The amount and declaration of future cash dividends are subject to approval by our Board of Directors and certain regulatory restrictions which are discussed in Item 1 Business Supervision and Regulation Dividends and Stock Repurchases in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, under the terms of the holding company line of credit agreement, FFI may only declare and pay a dividend if the total amount of dividends and stock repurchases during the current twelve months does not exceed 50 of EBITDA for the same twelve-month period. The Board of Directors did not declare a cash dividend during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024, respectively and declared a cash dividend of 0.01 per share during the three months ended March 31, 2024. During 2023, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends totaling 0.06 per share. We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024. However, we intend to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in the future to grow our businesses, which may include opening additional offices or acquiring complementary businesses that we believe will provide us with attractive risk-adjusted returns. As a result, we may seek to obtain additional borrowings and to sell additional shares of our common stock to raise funds which we might need for these or other purposes. There is no assurance, however, that, if required, we will succeed in obtaining additional borrowings or selling additional shares of our common stock or other securities on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all, as this will depend on market conditions and other factors outside of our control, as well as our future results of operations. See Item 1A, Risk Factors in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for information regarding the impact that future sales of our common stock may have on the share ownership of our existing stockholders. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain financial risks, which are discussed in detail in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the section titled Interest Rate Risk Management in this report as well as in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In accordance with SEC rules, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2024, of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods

 specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to claims, counter claims, suits and other litigation of the type that generally arise from the conduct of financial services businesses. We are not aware of any threatened or pending litigation that we expect will have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We disclosed certain risks and uncertainties that we face under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which we filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. There have been no material changes in these risk factors from those disclosed in such Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS On April 26, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to 75 million of its common stock. This plan has no stated expiration date. This stock repurchase program replaces and supersedes the stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors on October 30, 2018, which had authorized the Company to repurchase up to 2,200,000 shares of its common stock. No shares were repurchased by the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2024. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION None of our directors or executive officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b - trading arrangement or a non-Rule b -1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K) during the third quarter of 2024.
