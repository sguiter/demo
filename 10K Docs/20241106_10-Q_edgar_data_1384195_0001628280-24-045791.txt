 billion with security consisting of substantially all of the assets of the Company. In April 2019, the Company amended and restated the Credit Agreement with the Administrative Agent (as amended and restated, the Amended Credit Facility ). 
 On August 31, 2022, the Company modified its Amended Credit Facility through that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Second Credit Agreement"), extending the maturity date of the facility to August 2026 and the syndicate was modified to add five lenders, replacing five lenders. On February 12, 2024, the Company, Truist Bank as the Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank, and the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders") entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Second Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Amendment amends the definition of Free Cash Flow so amounts used by the Company for acquisitions will no longer be subtracted from the calculation of Free Cash Flow. 
 The Second Credit Agreement has a borrowing base of million, which is subject to periodic redeterminations, mandatory reductions and further adjustments from time to time. The borrowing base is redetermined semi-annually each May and November. The borrowing base is subject to reduction in certain circumstances such as the sale or disposition of certain oil and gas properties of the Company and cancellation of certain hedging positions. 
 Rather than Eurodollar loans, the reference rate in the Second Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). Also, the Second Credit Agreement permits the Company to declare dividends for its equity owners, subject to

 The interest rate on each SOFR Loan will be the adjusted term SOFR for the applicable interest period plus a margin between and (depending on the then-current level of borrowing base usage). The annual interest rate on each base rate loan is (a) the greatest of (i) the Administrative Agent s prime lending rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Second Credit Agreement) plus per annum, (iii) the adjusted term SOFR determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one month, plus per annum and (iv) per annum, plus (b) a margin between and per annum (depending on the then-current level of borrowing base usage). 
 The Second Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, which, among other things, require the maintenance of (i) a total Leverage Ratio of not more than to 1.0 and (ii) a minimum ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities (as such terms are defined in the Second Credit Agreement) of to 1.0. The Second Credit Agreement also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The Company is required to maintain on a rolling months basis, hedging transactions in respect of crude oil and natural gas, on not less than of the projected production from its proved, developed, and producing oil and gas. However, if the borrowing base utilization is less than at the hedge testing date and the Leverage Ratio is not greater than to 1.00, the required hedging percentage for months 13 through 24 of the rolling month period provided for will be from such hedge testing date to the next succeeding hedge testing date and if the borrowing base utilization percentage is equal to or greater than , but less than and the Leverage Ratio is not greater than to 1.00, the required hedging percentage for months 13 through 24 of the rolling month period provided for will be from such hedge testing date to the next succeeding hedge testing date. 
 As of September 30, 2024, million was outstanding on the Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Second Credit Agreement. 
 Under the Second Credit Agreement, the applicable percentage for the unused commitment fee is per annum for all levels of borrowing base utilization. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's unused line of credit was million, which was calculated by subtracting the outstanding Credit Facility balance of million and standby letters of credit of with state and federal agencies and with an insurance company for New Mexico state surety bonds) from the million borrowing base.

 Item 2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed financial statements and the notes to those condensed financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors, "Forward Looking Statements" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Overview 
 Ring Energy, Inc. (the "Company," "Ring," "we," "us," "our" and similar terms) is a growth oriented independent exploration and production company based in The Woodlands, Texas engaged in oil and natural gas development, production, acquisition, and exploration activities currently focused in the Permian Basin of Texas. Our primary drilling operations target the oil and liquids rich producing formations in the Northwest Shelf and the Central Basin Platform, both of which are part of the Permian Basin. 
 
 Business Description and Plan of Operation 
 The Company is focused on balancing reduction of long-term debt and further developing our oil and gas properties to maintain or grow our annual production. We intend to achieve both through proper allocation of cash flow generated by our operations and potentially through the sale of non-core assets. We intend to continue evaluating potential transactions to acquire strategic producing assets with attractive acreage positions that can provide competitive returns for our shareholders. 
 Growing production and reserves by developing our oil-rich resource base through conventional vertical and horizontal drilling . In an effort to maximize its value and resources potential, Ring intends to drill and develop its acreage base in both its Northwest Shelf and Central Basin Platform assets, allowing Ring to execute on its plan of operating within its generated cash flow. 
 Reduction of long-term debt and deleveraging of asset. Ring intends to reduce its long-term debt primarily through the use of excess cash flow and potentially through the sale of non-core assets. The Company believes that with its attractive field level margins, it is well positioned to maximize the value of its assets and deleverage its balance sheet. The Company also believes through potential accretive acquisitions and strategic asset dispositions, it can accelerate the strengthening of its balance sheet. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made net paydowns of 15 million on its revolving line of credit, resulting in the outstanding long-term debt balance of 392 million. 
 Employ industry leading drilling and completion techniques. Ring s executive team utilizes new and innovative technological advancements for completion optimization, comprehensive geological evaluation, and reservoir engineering analysis to generate value and to build future development opportunities. These technological advancements have led to a low-cost structure that helps maximize returns generated by our drilling programs. 
 Pursue strategic acquisitions with attractive upside potential. Ring has a history of acquiring leasehold positions that it believes to have additional resource potential that meet its targeted returns on invested capital and are comparable to its existing inventory of drilling locations. We pursue an acquisition strategy designed to increase reserves at attractive finding costs and complement our existing core properties. Management intends to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and structure them financially, to improve balance sheet metrics and be accretive to income metrics. Our executive team, with its extensive experience in the Permian Basin, has many relationships with operators and service providers in the region. Ring believes that leveraging the relationships of its management and board of directors is a competitive advantage in identifying potential acquisition targets.

 2024 Developments and Highlights 
 
 Drilling and Completion 
 In the first quarter of 2024, in the Northwest Shelf, the Company drilled and completed two 1-mile horizontal wells (one with a working interest of 99.5 and the other with a working interest of 100 ). In the Central Basin Platform, the Company drilled and completed nine wells, all with a working interest of 100 . Specifically, in our Andrews County acreage the Company drilled and completed three 1-mile horizontal wells, in the Ector County acreage the Company drilled three vertical wells, and in the Crane County acreage the Company drilled and completed three vertical wells. Additionally, within the Central Basin Platform, the Company drilled and completed one salt water disposal ("SWD") well in Crane County. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, in the Central Basin Platform, the Company drilled and completed eleven wells, all with a working interest of 100 . Specifically, in our Andrews County acreage the Company drilled and completed five 1-mile horizontal wells, in the Ector County acreage the Company drilled three vertical wells, and in the Crane County acreage the Company drilled and completed three vertical wells. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, in the Northwest Shelf in Yoakum County, the Company drilled and completed two 1-mile horizontal wells, each with a working interest of 100 , and one 1.5-mile horizontal well with a working interest of approximately 94.2 . Meanwhile, in the Central Basin Platform, the Company drilled and completed six vertical wells, all with a working interest of 100 , three in Ector County and three in Crane County. Finally, in the Central Basin Platform in Andrews County, the Company drilled four 1-mile horizontal wells, all with a working interest of 100 . Two of these wells were completed. The remaining two wells will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 The table below sets forth our drilling and completion activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Market Conditions and Commodity Prices 
 Our financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of crude oil and natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand both domestically and world wide, which are impacted by many factors. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 As a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices, and therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our drilling program, production volumes or revenues. 
 
 Average oil and natural gas prices received through 2023 and 2024 to date continue to demonstrate commodity price volatility and we believe oil and natural gas prices will continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. The ability to find and develop sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. 
 
 Natural Gas Takeaway Capacity 
 
 The Permian Basin has been experiencing a shortage of pipeline transportation in order to sell natural gas produced in the Basin, resulting in negative natural gas prices, whereby the seller is actually paying the purchaser to take the gas. We have experienced negative realized gas prices at times and conditions are continuing. If these depressed or inverted natural gas prices continue in the region, our natural gas revenues will continue to be negatively impacted. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Since 2022 inflation has increased costs associated with our capital program and production operations. We have experienced increases in the costs of many of the materials, supplies, equipment and services used in our operation. While 2024 costs have risen compared to prior years, overall industry activity has been muted and therefore service costs have remained flat or slightly decreased. In addition, the attempts to reduce inflation by the U.S. Federal Reserve have resulted in increased interest rates on debt. We continue to closely monitor costs and take all reasonable steps to mitigate the inflationary effect on our cost structure and also work to enhance our efficiency to minimize additional cost increases where possible.

 (1) Boe is calculated using six Mcf of natural gas as the equivalent of one barrel of oil. 
 Oil sales . Oil sales increased approximately 0.02 million from 90.4 million to 90.4 million due to a increase in sales volume from 1,106,531 barrels of oil to 1,214,788 barrels of oil, partially offset by a decrease in the average realized price per barrel from 81.69 to 74.43. Of the increase in volume of 108,257 barrels of oil, 94,512 barrels were from wells acquired and new wells drilled in the acreage acquired in the Founders Acquisition (which closed in August of 2023), as well as drilling activity in other areas, offset by natural declines from our legacy assets. The decreased average realized price per barrel was primarily a result of weaker market conditions. 
 Natural gas sales. Natural gas sales decreased approximately 4.4 million from 0.6 million to a negative 3.9 million. While our natural gas sales volume marginally increased from 1,567,104 Mcf to 1,705,027 Mcf, the average realized price per Mcf decreased from 0.36 to (2.26). Of the increase in volume of 137,923 Mcf, an increase of 95,557 Mcf was from the Founders Acquisition and 42,366 Mcf was attributable to legacy assets. The price decrease was driven by a significant reduction in realized revenue pricing due to low demand as a result of current pipeline capacity constraints. The realized revenue pricing included the impact of gas plant processing fees that were netted from revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross revenues were (0.50) per Mcf and fees were (1.76) per Mcf, compared to gross revenues of 2.16 per Mcf and fees of (1.80) per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This resulted in a net realized price of (2.26) per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.36 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Natural gas liquids sales. NGL sales decreased approximately 0.04 million from 2.7 million to 2.7 million. NGL sales volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 350,975 barrels of NGLs compared to 243,142 barrels of NGLs for the comparable period in 2023. Of the increase in volume of 107,833 barrels, 28,066 barrels were attributable to wells acquired and new wells drilled in the acreage acquired in the Founders Acquisition, with the remaining 79,767 barrels attributable to our legacy assets due to increased NGL yields. The average realized price per barrel of NGLs was 7.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to weaker market conditions.

 Oil sales . Oil sales increased approximately 30.0 million from 252.0 million to 282.0 million due to an increase in sales volume from 3,325,323 barrels of oil to 3,673,356 barrels of oil, further supported by a increase in the average realized price per barrel from 75.79 to 76.77. Of the increase in volume of 348,033 barrels, 431,512 barrels were from wells acquired and new wells drilled in the acreage acquired in the Founders Acquisition, as well as drilling activity in other areas, offset by natural declines from our legacy assets and sale of non-core assets. The increased average realized price per barrel was primarily the result of stronger market conditions. 
 Natural gas sales. Natural gas sales decreased approximately 8.2 million from 0.5 million to a negative 7.7 million. While the natural gas sales volume increased from 4,726,056 Mcf to 4,739,881 Mcf, the average realized price per Mcf decreased from 0.11 to (1.61). Of the increase in volume of 13,825 Mcf, 341,102 Mcf was from wells acquired and new wells drilled in the acreage acquired in the Founders Acquisition, and the offsetting decrease of (327,277) Mcf was attributable to natural declines in our legacy assets. The price decrease was driven by lower market conditions. The realized revenue pricing includes the impact of gas plant processing fees that were netted from revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross revenues were 0.09 per Mcf and fees were (1.70) per Mcf, compared to gross revenues of 1.73 per Mcf and fees of (1.62) per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This resulted in a net realized price of (1.61) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.11 per Mcf for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Natural gas liquids sales. NGL sales slightly decreased by 0.03 million from 8.6 million to 8.5 million. NGL sales volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 919,225 barrels of NGLs compared to 715,832 barrels of NGLs for the comparable period in 2023. Of the increase in volume of 203,393 barrels, 95,515 barrels were attributable to the wells acquired and new wells drilled in the acreage acquired in the Founders Acquisition, and 107,878 barrels were from our legacy assets. The average realized price per barrel of NGLs was 9.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.97 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, attributable to weaker market conditions.

 Lease operating expenses. Our total lease operating expenses LOE increased from 18.0 million to 20.3 million and decreased on a per Boe basis from 11.18 to 10.98. These per Boe amounts are calculated by dividing our total lease operating expenses by our total volume sold, in Boe. Total LOE increased primarily due to a 15 increase in production of 239,077 Boe as a result of the new wells acquired in the Founders Acquisition as well as new wells drilled and completed from our development program. Specific cost categories with significant increases included electricity and chemical. 
 Gathering, transportation and processing costs. Our total gathering, transportation and processing costs GTP increased from negative 4,530 to 102,420 and increased on a per Boe basis from 0.00 to 0.06. Beginning May 1, 2022, due to a natural gas processing entity taking control of transportation at the wellhead, GTP costs were re-classified as a reduction to oil and natural gas sales revenues. However, GTP costs increased on the period shown due to one remaining contract with a natural gas processing entity in place where point of control of gas dictates requiring the fees be recorded as an expense. 
 Ad valorem taxes. Our total ad valorem taxes increased from 1.8 million to 2.2 million and increased on a per Boe basis from 1.10 to 1.17. Of the 0.4 million increase in ad valorem taxes, 0.4 million was for Yoakum County properties, and 0.2 million for Ector County properties, offset by a reduction in 0.3 million related to Crane County tax estimates. 
 Oil and natural gas production taxes . Oil and natural gas production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were 5.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased to 4.71 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in average tax percentage is due to the divestiture of the New Mexico assets in the third quarter of 2023, which had higher tax rates on both oil and gas than the remaining Texas assets.

 (1) Not meaningful. 
 Lease operating expenses. Our total LOE increased from 51.4 million to 58.0 million and LOE per Boe increased from 10.65 to 10.77. Total LOE increased primarily due to an 11 increase in production of 553,730 Boe as a result of the new wells acquired in the Founders Acquisition as well as new wells drilled and completed from our development program. Specific cost categories with significant increases included chemical, electricity, salaries, and other employee expenses. 
 Gathering, transportation and processing costs. Our total GTP increased from negative 6,985 to 376,103 and increased on a per Boe basis from 0.00 to 0.07. Beginning May 1, 2022, due to a natural gas processing entity taking control of transportation at the wellhead, GTP costs were re-classified as a reduction to oil and natural gas sales revenues. However, GTP costs increased on the period shown due to one remaining contract with a natural gas processing entity in place where point of control of gas dictates requiring the fees be recorded as an expense. 
 Ad valorem taxes. Our total ad valorem taxes increased from 5.1 million to 5.6 million and decreased on a per Boe basis from 1.06 to 1.05. Of the approximate 0.5 million increase in ad valorem taxes, 0.9 million was from the addition of Ector County properties acquired in the Founders Acquisition, offset by a net reduction in estimates for other jurisdictions of 0.4 million. 
 Oil and natural gas production taxes . Oil and natural gas production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were 5.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased to 4.33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The overall average percentage of production taxes to oil and gas sales in 2024 is 4.7 which is in line with historical rates. However, in May 2024, an accrual of (0.9) million was made for estimated severance tax refunds expected, which lowered the average for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Depreciation, depletion and amortization . Our depreciation, depletion and amortization increased from 22.0 million to 25.7 million due to a higher depletion rate as well as an increase of 239,077 in Boe produced. Additional trucks were leased for field operations, resulting in higher finance lease amortization costs. Our average depreciation, depletion and amortization per Boe increased from 13.65 per Boe to 13.87 per Boe, due to the higher percentage reduction in the Boe amortization base compared to the reduction in the total estimated costs of property. 
 Asset retirement obligation accretion. Our asset retirement obligation ARO accretion increased slightly from 354,175 to 354,195 due to additional ARO accretion associated with properties acquired in the Founders Acquisition as well as new drilled and completed wells, offset by wells plugged and abandoned and sold. 
 Operating lease expense . Our operating lease expense increased from 138,220 to 175,091 due to additional office space leased in The Woodlands office expansion beginning in October 2023. 
 General and administrative expense . General and administrative ("G A") expense decreased from 7.1 million to 6.4 million. Of the 0.7 million cost decrease, there was a decrease of 2.1 million in share-based compensation costs, offset by 0.7 million of an increase in salaries and wages, 0.5 million in bonus compensation, 0.2 million in transaction costs, and 0.1 million in other professional fees.

Our average depreciation, depletion and amortization per Boe increased from 13.26 per Boe to 13.78 per Boe, due to the increase in the total estimated costs of property, as well as the reduction in the Boe amortization base. 
 Asset retirement obligation accretion. Our ARO accretion decreased from 1,073,900 to 1,057,213 primarily as a result of wells plugged and abandoned and sold, offset by the additional ARO accretion associated with the properties acquired in the Founders Acquisition. 
 Operating lease expense . Our operating lease expense increased from 366,711 to 525,272 due to the additional office space leased in The Woodlands office. 
 General and administrative expense . G A expense increased from 21.0 million to 21.6 million, with the 0.6 million cost increase due to an increase of 1.6 million in salaries and wages, 0.6 million for an employee retention tax credit that was received in 2023, 0.4 million in bonus compensation, 0.3 million in other professional fees, and 0.3 million in legal fees. This was offset by a decrease of 2.5 million in share-based compensation costs and 0.3 million in lower transaction costs.

 Interest expense. Interest expense decreased from 11.4 million to 10.8 million primarily due to lower amounts outstanding on our Credit Facility, with a weighted average daily debt of approximately 406.5 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to approximately 422.6 million during the third quarter of 2023. Offsetting this change was an increase in interest rates, with a weighted average annual interest rate of 9.3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 9.2 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Gain (loss) on derivative contracts. We recorded a gain on derivative contracts of 24.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss on derivative contracts of 39.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the derivative contract settlements, we recorded a realized loss of 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a realized loss of 5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction of 3.5 million in the realized loss was a result of more favorable settlements of crude oil derivative contracts during the current year. For the marked-to-market contracts, we recorded an unrealized gain of 26.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and an unrealized loss of 33.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in position was primarily due to the changes in crude oil futures prices.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of 0.0 million, compared to 0.3 million as of December 31, 2023. We strive to keep our cash balance as low as possible to minimize our outstanding debt and associated interest. At certain times we reflect a zero book balance while utilizing the float on outstanding checks. We had net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 147.1 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 142.4 million for the same period in 2023, which was primarily due to higher year to date revenues, which resulted in more cash received from purchasers. We had net cash used in investing activities of 113.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in investing activities of 170.9 million for the same period in 2023, driven by the deferred cash payment made for the Stronghold Acquisition in the first quarter of 2023 as well as the payment for the Founders Acquisition in the third quarter of 2023, with no comparable payments made to date in 2024. Net cash used in financing activities was 34.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 during which time 33 million was the net paydown of principal on our Credit Facility. 
 We will continue to focus on maximizing cash flow in 2024 through a combination of cost monitoring and prudent capital allocation, which includes prioritizing our capital to projects we believe will provide high rates of return in the current commodity price environment. We will continue our pursuit of acquisitions and business combinations, seeking opportunities that we believe will provide high margin properties with attractive returns at current commodity prices. 
 During the remainder of 2024, we will remain focused on maximizing cash flow, reducing our debt level, and maximizing our liquidity. 
 Availability of Capital Resources under Credit Facility 
 As of September 30, 2024, 392 million was outstanding on our Credit Facility and we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility matures in August 2026. The borrowing base under our Credit Facility is 600 million. The borrowing base is redetermined semi-annually on each May and November. See "NOTE 8 REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT" in the Notes to the condensed financial statements for more information on our Credit Facility.

 Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and included as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets. Any gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of outstanding derivative financial instruments and from the settlement of derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings and included as a component of Other Income (Expense) in the accompanying Condensed Statements of Operations. 
 The use of derivative transactions involves the risk that the counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. At September 30, 2024, 100 of our derivative instruments are with lenders under our Credit Facility. 
 
 Effects of Inflation and Pricing 
 The oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies, suppliers and others associated with the industry puts significant pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry. Typically, as prices for oil and natural gas increase, so do associated costs. Material changes in prices impact our current revenue stream, estimates of future reserves, borrowing base calculations of bank loans and the value of properties in purchase and sale transactions. Material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital, borrow money, and retain personnel. We anticipate business costs will vary in accordance with commodity prices for oil and natural gas, and the associated increase or decrease in demand for services related to production and exploration. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 
 
 Capital Resources for Future Acquisition and Development Opportunities 
 We continuously evaluate potential acquisitions and development opportunities. To the extent possible, we intend to acquire producing properties with lower-risk undeveloped drilling opportunities rather than properties with higher-risk exploratory opportunities. We do not intend to limit our evaluation to any one state, but we presently have no intention to acquire offshore properties or properties located outside of the United States. 
 The pursuit of and the acquisition of accretive oil and gas properties is highly competitive and may require substantially greater capital than we currently have available and obtaining additional capital may require that we obtain either short-

 term or long-term debt or sell our equity or both. Further, it may be necessary for us to retain outside consultants and others in our endeavors to locate desirable oil and gas properties. 
 The process of acquiring one or more additional oil and gas properties would impact our financial position, reduce our cash position and likely increase our debt levels. The types of costs that we may incur include the costs to retain consultants and investment bankers specializing in the purchase of oil and gas properties, obtaining petroleum engineering reports relative to the oil and gas properties that we are investigating, legal fees associated with any such acquisitions including title reports, SEC reporting expenses, and negotiating definitive agreements. Additionally, accounting fees may be incurred relative to obtaining and evaluating historical and pro forma information regarding oil and gas properties. Even though we may incur these costs, there is no assurance that we will ultimately be able to consummate additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing properties.

 Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from decreases in oil and natural gas prices. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for crude oil and spot prices in the Permian Basin. Historically, prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable. We expect pricing volatility to continue. 
 The prices we receive depend on many factors outside of our control. A significant decrease in the prices of oil or natural gas would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we enter into crude oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. 
 Customer Credit Risk 
 Our principal exposure to credit risk is through receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production (approximately 32.5 million as of September 30, 2024). We are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with our most significant customers, or purchasers. We do not require our purchasers to post collateral, and the inability of our significant purchasers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. Refer to the following table for detail on the top three purchasers of our oil, natural gas, and NGL revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not materially impact our business because we could readily find other purchasers for our oil and natural gas.

 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our Credit Facility, which bears variable interest based upon a prime rate and is therefore susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company s cash and cash equivalents and the interest rate paid on borrowings under the Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 392 million outstanding on our Credit Facility with a weighted average annual interest rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 9.3 . A 1 change in the interest rate on our Credit Facility would result in an estimated 3.9 million change in our annual interest expense. See "NOTE 8 REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT" in the Notes to the condensed financial statements for more information on the Company s interest rates of our Credit Facility. 
 Currently, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.

 Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Foreign sales accounted for none of the Company's sales; the Company accepts payment for its commodity sales only in U.S. dollars. Ring is therefore not exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on these sales. 
 Please also see Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties we face in our business. 
 
 Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of Paul D. McKinney, our principal executive officer, and Travis T. Thomas, our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Based on management s evaluation, Messrs. McKinney and Thomas concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1: Legal Proceedings 
 There were no material developments during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 in the legal proceeding described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 1A: Risk Factors 
 We are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. For a discussion of these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us. Further, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect us.
