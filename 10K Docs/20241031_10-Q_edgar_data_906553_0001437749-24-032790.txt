Gaming taxes recorded as online expense, excluding taxes paid under collaborative arrangements (see Collaborative Arrangements below for further discussion), totaled million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 million of valuation allowance on our state income tax net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. 
 
 Other Long-Term Tax Liabilities 
 The Company's income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other tax authorities in the locations where it operates. The Company assesses potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes, which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. 
 
 Uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. These accounting standards utilize a two -step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. 
 
 Tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the "more likely than not" standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the "more likely than not" standard, it is required that the tax position is derecognized. Accounting standards for uncertain tax positions specifically prohibit the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, the Company will recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. If applicable, accrued interest and penalties are included in other long-term tax liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The IRS has selected our federal corporate income tax return for the tax year ended December 31, 2021, for examination. The IRS examination began in the second quarter of 2024 and is early in the process. As of September 30, 2024 , and for the three and nine months then ended, there were no changes to our unrecognized tax benefits to date. 
 
 million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 

Our five percent equity ownership in FanDuel is recorded at cost in accordance with the measurement alternative allowed under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 321, Accounting for Investments in Equity Securities . We do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over FanDuel's operating and financial policies. We evaluate the investment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recorded value of the investment when any observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment would require an adjustment of the investment to fair value. 

-year marketing agreement with a -year renewal option that provides for marketing and promotional services at Resorts Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. This marketing agreement allows us to provide our online customers in New Jersey access to a gaming entertainment property where they can redeem points earned under a loyalty program for such amenities as complimentary food beverage and hotel rooms. The acquired company is aggregated into our Online segment (See Note 10, Segment Information ). 
 
 Consideration Transferred 
 The fair value of the consideration transferred for the membership interests of Resorts Digital included the purchase price of the net assets transferred. The total gross consideration was million (with million of cash and restricted cash acquired and million not paid as of September 30, 2024, for total cash paid for acquisition, net of cash received as of September 30, 2024 of million). 
 
 Status of Purchase Price Allocation 
 The Company is following the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805 ("ASC 805" ). For purposes of these condensed consolidated financial statements, we have allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on preliminary estimates of fair value as determined by management with the assistance from third -party specialists. The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been recorded as goodwill. The Company has recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition based on fair value estimates as of the date of the acquisition. The determination of the fair values of all the acquired intangible assets and the related determination of their estimated lives is currently in process. This determination requires significant judgment and as such, management has not completed its valuation analysis and calculations in sufficient detail necessary to finalize the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, along with the related allocation of goodwill. The final fair value determinations may be different than those reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2024 . 

The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price:

The goodwill recognized is the excess of the purchase price over the preliminary values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Online reportable segment. 
 
 The Company expensed million of acquisition related costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . These costs are included in project development, preopening and writedowns on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The revenue and earnings from the acquisition are not material for the period subsequent to acquisition through September 30, 2024 .

with payment timing and the payment amount subject to an excess cash flow waterfall payment prioritization and maintenance of a certain leverage ratio, among other restrictions under Wilton Rancheria s
 third -party credit agreement that provided funding for the construction project. Given the significant barriers of the project, a majority of the advances made during the
 10 -year period prior to the Sky River Casino opening were historically reserved in full when advanced. The Sky River Casino opened on
 August 15, 2022 and after generating cash flows from operations, we updated our evaluation of expected losses on the note receivable which resulted in a partial release of the allowance during the
 fourth quarter of
 2022. The Wilton Rancheria amended their
 third -party credit agreement in
 March 2023 and such amendment effectively allowed Sky River Casino to begin making previously disallowed distributions, under the excess cash flow waterfall. Given the amendment in the
 first quarter of
 2023, the Company updated its evaluation of its expected losses on the note receivable. As the amendment allowed for quarterly payments to begin and given the sustained operating strength of the recently opened property, the Company concluded it expected to receive all payments due under the note receivable. As such, the Company removed the remaining allowance on the note receivable in the
 first quarter of
 2023, which represented a reserve on both the development advances and interest on the note. The allowance reduction was thus allocated accordingly and
 million is recorded in project development, preopening and writedowns and 
 million is recorded in interest income, both reflected in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the
 nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The Company received 
 
 mi llion in principal payments and
 
 million in interest due under the note receivable during the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and 
 
 mi llion in principal payments and
 
 million in interest due under the note receivable during the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2023 . As of 
 September 30, 2024 , the principal and interest outstanding on the note receivable was fully repaid. Separately, the management agreement provides for us to manage the gaming facility upon opening for a period of
 seven years and receive a monthly management fee for our services based on the monthly performance of the gaming facility. The management fee of
 million and
 million for our management services for the
 three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and 
 million and 
 million for the
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, is paid monthly and recorded in management fee revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

On
 September 27, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the management agreement with Wilton Rancheria that became effective
 October 2, 2024, and provides for the Company to serve as manager of the Wilton Rancheria expansion to the Sky River Casino inclusive of
 additional slots, a parking garage, a
 -room hotel and spa,
 two additional food and beverage outlets and an entertainment and events center. The Company is
 not obligated to fund the construction and the management fee remains unchanged.

Share-Based Compensation 
 We account for share-based awards exchanged for employee services in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for share-based payments. Under the guidance, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the employee's requisite service period. 
 
 The following table provides classification detail of the total costs related to our share-based employee compensation plans reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Performance Shares 
 Our stock incentive plan provides for the issuance of Performance Share Units ("PSU") grants which may be earned, in whole or in part, upon the passage of time and the attainment of performance criteria. We periodically review our estimates of performance against the defined criteria to assess the expected payout of each outstanding PSU grant and adjust our stock compensation expense accordingly. 
 
 The PSU grants awarded in third quarter 2021 and fourth quarter 2019 fully vested during the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Common shares under the 2021 grant were issued based on the determination by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors ("Compensation Committee") of our actual achievement of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization and Rent under master leases ("EBITDAR") and return on invested capital for the two -year performance period from July 2021 to June 2023. Common shares under the 2019 grant were issued based on the determination by the Compensation Committee of net revenue growth and EBITDAR growth for the three -year performance period of the grant. As provided under the provisions of our stock incentive plan, certain of the participants elected to surrender a portion of the shares to be received to pay the withholding and other payroll taxes payable on the compensation resulting from the vesting of the PSUs. 
 
 The PSU grant awarded in July 2021 resulted in a total of shares being issued during the first quarter of 2024, representing approximately shares per PSU. Of the shares issued, a total of were surrendered by the participants for payroll taxes, resulting in a net issuance of shares due to the vesting of the 2021 grant. The actual achievement level under the award metrics approximated the estimated performance as of the year-end 2023; therefore, the vesting of the PSUs had minimal impact to compensation costs of million in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The PSU grant awarded in December 2019 resulted in a total of shares being issued during the first quarter of 2023, representing approximately shares per PSU. Of the shares issued, a total of were surrendered by the participants for payroll taxes, resulting in a net issuance of shares due to the vesting of the 2019 grant. The actual achievement level under the award metrics equaled the estimated performance as of the year-end 2022; therefore, the vesting of the PSUs did not impact compensation costs in our 2023 condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 Unamortized Stock Compensation Expense and Recognition Period 
 As of September 30, 2024 , there was approximately million, million and million of total unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to unvested restricted stock units ("RSUs"), PSUs and career shares, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , the unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to our RSUs, PSUs and career shares are expected to be recognized over approximately years, years and years, respectively. 

These inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: 
 
 Level 1 : Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
 
 Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. 
 
 Level 3 : Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
 
 As required by the guidance for fair value measurements, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Thus, assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3 may be measured at fair value using inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2 and unobservable (Level 3 ). Management's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. 
 
 Balances Measured at Fair Value 
 The following tables show the fair values of certain of our financial instruments: 

Restricted cash 
 Investment available for sale 

Restricted cash 
 Investment available for sale 

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 The fair values of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, classified in the fair value hierarchy as Level 1, are based on statements received from our banks as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Investment Available for Sale 
 We have an investment in a single municipal bond issuance of million aggregate principal amount of Urban Renewal Tax Increment Revenue Bonds, Taxable Series 2007 that is classified as available for sale with a maturity date of June 1, 2037. We are the only holder of this instrument and there is no quoted market price for this instrument. As such, the fair value of this investment is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The estimate of the fair value of such investment was determined using a combination of current market rates and estimates of market conditions for instruments with similar terms, maturities and degrees of risk and a discounted cash flows analysis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . The significant unobservable input used to determine fair value of the instrument in the discounted cash flows analysis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is a discount rate of and , respectively. Unrealized gains and losses on this instrument resulting from changes in the fair value of the instrument are not charged to earnings, but rather are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders' equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheets and in the condensed consolidated statements of other comprehensive income. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , million and million, respectively, of the carrying value of the investment available for sale is included as a current asset in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , million and million, respectively, is included in other assets, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The discount associated with this investment of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, is netted with the investment balance and is being accreted over the life of the investment using the effective interest method. The accretion of such discount is included in interest income on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the Company's Level 3 investment available for sale asset: 

Total gains (realized or unrealized): 
 Included in interest income 
 Included in other comprehensive income (loss) 
 Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements:

 Balance at end of reporting period 

We are exposed to valuation risk on our Level 3 financial instruments. We estimate our risk exposure using a sensitivity analysis of potential changes in the significant unobservable inputs of our fair value measurements. Our Level 3 financial instruments are most susceptible to valuation risk caused by changes in the discount rate. If the discount rate in our fair value measurements increased or decreased by 100 basis points, the change would not cause the value of our fair value measurements to change significantly. 
 
 The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, classified in the fair value hierarchy as Level 3, is utilized in performing the Company's impairment analyses. The value of our gaming licenses is determined using a multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific discounted cash flow model which utilized Level 3 inputs. 
 
 Balances Disclosed at Fair Value 
 The following tables provide the fair value measurement information about our obligation under assessment agreements and note receivable. As of September 30, 2024 , the outstanding principal balance under the note receivable was paid in full.

The estimated fair value of our obligation under assessment arrangements is based on a discounted cash flows approach after giving consideration to the changes in market rates of interest, creditworthiness of both parties and credit spread. The fair value of our note receivable as of December 31, 2023 , was estimated to equal its carrying value after consideration of the expected repayment timing of the remaining balance. The estimated fair value of our Credit Facility is based on a relative value analysis performed on or about September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . The estimated fair values of our senior notes are based on quoted market prices as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . The other debt is fixed-rate debt consisting of finance leases with various maturity dates from 2024 to 2025. The other debt is not traded and does not have an observable market input; therefore, we have estimated fair value to be equal to the carrying value for these obligations. 
 
 There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 measurements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 

EBITDAR is a commonly used measure of performance in our industry that we believe, when considered with measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, facilitates comparisons between us and our competitors and provides our investors a more complete understanding of our operating results before the impact of investing transactions, financing transactions and income taxes. Management has historically adjusted EBITDAR when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Executive Overview 
 Boyd Gaming Corporation (and together with its subsidiaries, the "Company," "Boyd," "Boyd Gaming," "we" or "us") was incorporated in the state of Nevada in 1988 and has been operating since 1975. The Company's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "BYD". 
 
 We are a geographically diversified operator of 28 gaming entertainment properties. Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, we have gaming entertainment properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In addition, we own and operate Boyd Interactive, a business-to-business ("B2B") and business-to-consumer ("B2C") online gaming business. We also manage the Sky River Casino located in California under a management agreement with Wilton Rancheria. We have the following four reportable segments: (i) Las Vegas Locals; (ii) Downtown Las Vegas; (iii) Midwest South; and (iv) Online, (collectively "Reportable Segments"). The Las Vegas Locals, Downtown Las Vegas and Midwest South segments include the operating results of our gaming entertainment properties. The table below lists the Reportable Segment classification of each of our gaming entertainment properties, which are each also operating segments, that were aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, the regulatory environments in which they operate and their management and reporting structure. The Online segment includes the operating results of Boyd Interactive, including the operating results of Resorts Digital Gaming, LLC ("Resorts Digital") upon acquisition on September 1, 2024, and our online gaming operations through collaborative arrangements with third parties throughout the United States, both of which are also operating segments. To reconcile Reportable Segments information to the condensed consolidated information, the Company has aggregated nonreportable operating segments into a Managed Other category. The Managed Other category includes management fees earned under our management contract with Wilton Rancheria for the management of Sky River Casino in northern California and the operating results of Lattner Entertainment Group Illinois, LLC, our Illinois distributed gaming operator ("Lattner").

Most of our gaming entertainment properties also include hotel, restaurants, bars, sportsbook, retail and other amenities. Our main business emphasis is on slot revenues, which highly depends on the number of visits and spending levels of customers at our properties. 
 
 Our gaming entertainment properties have historically generated significant operating cash flow, with the majority of our revenue being cash-based. While we do provide casino credit and the ability to transfer digital funds from a player's cashless "BoydPay" wallet, subject to certain gaming regulations and jurisdictions, most of our customers wager with cash and pay for non-gaming services with cash or by credit card. 
 
 Our industry is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our operations to generate operating cash flow to fund maintenance capital expenditures, pay income taxes, repay debt financing and associated interest costs, repurchase our debt or equity securities, pay dividends, and provide excess cash for future development and to help fund acquisitions. 
 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to increase shareholder value by pursuing strategic initiatives that improve and grow our business. 
 
 Growing Revenues and Operating Efficiently 
 We are committed to growing revenues and building loyalty among core customers through targeted marketing investments with a focus on maximizing gaming revenues while operating as efficiently as possible. 
 
 Balance Sheet Strength 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and finding opportunities to diversify and increase our cash flow. We are also committed to a balanced capital allocation approach with our cash flows, with a current emphasis on investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders. 
 
 Evaluating Acquisition and Growth Opportunities 
 Our evaluations of potential investments and growth opportunities are strategic, deliberate, and disciplined. Our goal is to identify and pursue opportunities that grow our business, are available at the right price and deliver a solid return for shareholders. These investments can take the form of expanding and enhancing offerings and amenities at existing properties, developing new properties, expanding and enhancing online sports wagering and online casino offerings as they are legalized in and around the states we operate today, and asset acquisitions. 
 
 Maintaining Our Brand 
 The ability of our Team Members to deliver great customer service helps distinguish our Company and our brands from our competitors. Our Team Members are an important reason that our customers continue to choose our properties over the competition across the country. In addition, we have established nationwide branding through our "Boyd Rewards" loyalty program. Our players use their Boyd Rewards cards to earn and redeem points at all of our gaming entertainment properties and online casino gaming offerings. Boyd Rewards, among other benefits, rewards players for their loyalty by entitling them to qualify for promotions and monetary discounts, earn rewards toward gaming and nongaming activities and receive benefits such as vacations and luxury gifts. 
 
 Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") 
 We seek to fulfill our commitment to CSR initiatives through four core pillars: Environment, People, Communities and Corporate Governance. We invest in the well-being of our communities and future generations through economic contributions and endeavor to reduce our carbon footprint, strive to be an employer of choice where every Team Member is treated with dignity and respect, and promote a culture of conducting business with the highest level of integrity.

Our Key Performance Indicators 
 We use several key performance measures to evaluate the operations of our gaming entertainment properties. These key performance measures include the following: 

Gaming revenue measures : slot handle , which means the dollar amount wagered in slot machines, and table game drop , which means the total amount of cash, including digital funds transferred from the players' cashless "BoydPay" wallets, deposited in table games drop boxes, plus the sum of markers issued at all table games, are measures of volume and/or market share. Slot win and table game hold , which means the amount of wagers on slot machines and table games, respectively, retained by us and recorded as gaming revenues, and represents the difference between customer wagers and customer winnings on slot machines and table games, respectively. Slot win percentage and table game hold percentage, which are not fully controllable by us, represent the relationship between slot handle to slot win and table game drop to table game hold, respectively. 

Food beverage revenue measures : average guest check , which means the average amount spent per customer visit and is a measure of volume and product offerings; number of guests served ("food covers"), which is an indicator of volume; and the cost per guest served , which is a measure of operating margin. 

Room revenue measures : hotel occupancy rate , which measures the utilization of our available rooms; and average daily rate ("ADR"), which is a price measure; and the cost per room , which is a measure of operating margin.

Total Revenues 
 Total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 58.1 million, or 6.4 , compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily due to an increase in online revenue of 51.0 million, which was driven by the following: (i) an increase of 31.8 million in reimbursements of gaming taxes and other expenses paid on behalf of our online partners, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the prior year comparable period; (ii) a 13.2 million increase in revenue under our market access agreements; and (iii) a 6.1 million increase in revenue from Boyd Interactive's operations. 
 
 Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 105.2 million, or 3.8 , compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily due to the following: (i) an increase in online revenue of 119.3 million, which was driven by an increase of 92.0 million in reimbursements of gaming taxes and other expenses paid on behalf of our online partners, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the prior year comparable period, a 14.9 million increase in revenue under our market access agreements and a 12.4 million increase in revenue from Boyd Interactive's operations; (ii) an increase in food beverage revenue of 9.4 million primarily due to an increase in average guest check of 6.4 ; (iii) an increase of 9.9 million related to the Sky River Casino management fee; and (iv) offset by a decrease in gaming revenue of 40.7 million. The gaming revenue decline was primarily driven by the first quarter, which contributed to 30.2 million of the gaming revenue decline for the first nine months of the year. Further, more than half of the 40.7 million gaming revenue decline, or 23.0 million, was related to January as severe winter storms impacted the Midwest South segment in January. In addition, gaming revenues were down from the prior year due to decreased visitation in the current year in our Las Vegas segments as the first quarter of 2023, and January in particular, was strengthened by increased visitation to Las Vegas. We also saw competitive pressures from a new competitor that opened in our Las Vegas Locals market contribute to the year over year gaming revenue declines. Year over year gaming revenue trends improved in the third quarter of 2024 as the increase in gaming revenue from our new land-based Treasure Chest casino that opened in June 2024 offset the competitive pressures in the Las Vegas Locals market. 
 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income increased by 2.1 million, or 1.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the prior year comparable period. W hile online revenues grew 51.0 million, 31.8 million of the online revenue growth is due to reimbursements of gaming taxes and other expenses paid on behalf of our online partners that results in zero operating income as an equal amount is recorded as an expense. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by an increase in depreciation expense of 5.6 million over the prior year comparable period which is primarily driven by the opening of the new land-based Treasure Chest casino in June 2024. Operating income was also unfavorably impacted by 11.3 million in project development, preopening and writedowns, primarily related to 8.1 million in asset writedowns and 3.2 million in project development and preopening costs. 
 
 Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 80.3 million, or 10.8 , compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily due to the 40.7 million gaming revenue decline, as discussed above. In addition, while online revenues grew 119.3 million, 92.0 million of the online revenue growth is due to reimbursements of gaming taxes and other expenses paid on behalf of our online partners that results in zero operating income as an equal amount is also recorded as an expense. Operating income was also unfavorably impacted by: (i) 10.1 million in project development and preopening costs, of which 4.9 million related to the opening of the Treasure Chest land-based casino; (ii) 3.0 million of demolition costs; (iii) 9.0 million in asset writedowns and (iv) a 6.0 million increase in impairment of assets over the prior year comparable period as the Company recorded an impairment charge of 10.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to a gaming license right in the Midwest South segment, compared to a 4.5 million impairment charge related to goodwill in the Managed Other category during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Finally, in the prior year, operating income was favorably impacted by a 20.1 million reduction of the allowance on a note receivable with Wilton Rancheria ("Wilton Note") for development advances over the 10 years prior to the Sky River Casino opening as we evaluated the current expected credit losses after an amendment to Wilton Rancheria s third-party construction loan in March 2023 that allowed for payments to us to begin in March 2023. 

Net Income 

Net income de

 September 30, 2024
 , compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily due to the following: (i) 3.9 million increase in interest expense from the prior year comparable period due to 
 an increase in the weighted average long-term debt balance of 120.6 million; (ii) 1.2 million interest income decline due to a reduction in interest earned on the Wilton Note during the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024
 , as the principal outstanding under the Wilton Note was fully repaid in the first quarter of 2024; (iii) 1.0 million increase in the income tax provision; offset by (iv) an increase in operating income of 2.1 million, as discussed above.

Table of Contents 

Net income de 
 creased 120.0 
 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 , compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily due to the 80.3 million decrease in operating income, as discussed above. In addition, interest income decreased 21.2 million during the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024
 , due to an adjustment to the expected loss for interest on the Wilton Note that impacted interest income favorably during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and interest earned on the Wilton Note during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Finally, net income decreased due to a 16.2 million increase in the income tax provision as the nine months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from the release of state tax valuation allowances of 35.9 million in the prior year and was offset by the operational performance decline and lower resulting taxes during the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024
 . 

Operating Revenues 

We derive the majority of our revenues from our gaming operations, which produced approximately 
 67 of revenues for the three and 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
 71 of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 
 2023.
 Online revenues, including reimbursements received from our third-party operators for gaming taxes and other expenses we pay under collaborative arrangements, represent our next most significant revenue source, generating 
 15 
 and 
 10 
 of revenues for the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024
 and 
 2023
 , respectively, and 14 and 11 of revenues for the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
 2023, respectively.
 Food beverage revenues, room revenues, management fee revenues and other revenues separately contributed 8 or less of revenues during these periods.

Gaming 
 Gaming revenues are comprised primarily of the net win from our slot machine operations and to a lesser extent from table games win. Gaming revenues were essentially flat at 640.5 million and 641.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The decrease in gaming revenues of 40.7 million, or 2.1 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the prior year comparable period, was primarily due to declines in slot handle of 1.4 , slot win of 0.8 and table game hold of 2.2 . Gaming revenues were impacted by winter storms throughout the Midwest South in January, market softness during the first quarter in our Las Vegas Locals segment, competitive pressures through all three quarters in the Las Vegas Locals segment after a new competitor entered the market in December 2023, and increased visitation in our Las Vegas segments in the prior year, particularly in the first quarter, all as discussed above. 
 
 Food Beverage 
 Food beverage revenues increased 1.7 million, or 2.5 , and 9.4 million, or 4.4 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the prior year comparable periods, primarily due to an increase in average guest check of 7.0 and 6.4 , respectively, offset by a decline in food covers of 5.9 and 4.7 , respectively. 
 
 Room 
 Room revenues increased 1.5 million, or 3.1 , and 3.2 million, or 2.2 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year comparable periods, primarily due to an increase in hotel occupancy rate of 1.7 and 1.0 , respectively.

 Online revenues increased 119.3 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily driven by an increase of 92.0 million in reimbursements of gaming taxes and other expenses paid on behalf of our online partners, a 14.9 million increase in revenue under our market access agreements and a 12.4 million increase in revenue from Boyd Interactive's operations, inclusive of Resorts Digital upon Acquisition. 
 
 Management fee 
 Management fee revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 21.0 million and 17.2 milli on, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 64.5 million and 54.6 million, respectively, relate to our management agreement with Wilton Rancheria to manage the Sky River Casino in northern California. 
 
 Other 
 Other revenues relate to patronage visits at the other amenities at our properties, including entertainment and nightclub revenues, retail sales, theater tickets and other venu es. Other revenues increased 0.6 million , or 1.6 , and 4.1 million, or 4.0 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. 
 
 Revenues and Adjusted EBITDAR by Reportable Segment 
 We determine each property's profitability based on Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent ("Adjusted EBITDAR"), which represents earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, deferred rent, master lease rent expense, other operating items, net, share-based compensation expense, project development, preopening and writedown expenses, impairments of assets, loss on early extinguishments and modifications of debt and other items, net, as applicable. Reportable Segment Adjusted EBITDAR is the aggregate sum of the Adjusted EBITDAR for each of the gaming entertainment properties comprising our Las Vegas Locals, Downtown Las Vegas and Midwest South segments and our Online segment. Results for Downtown Las Vegas include the results of our travel agency and captive insurance company in Hawaii. Results for our nonreportable operating segments, including Lattner and our Sky River Casino management fees, are aggregated in the Managed Other category. Corporate expense represents unallocated payroll, professional fees, rent, aircraft expenses and various other expenses that are not directly related to our casino, hotel and online operations. Furthermore, for purposes of this presentation, corporate expense excludes its portion of share-based compensation expense. 
 
 EBITDAR is a commonly used measure of performance in our industry that we believe, when considered with measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), facilitates comparisons between us and our competitors and provides our investors a more complete understanding of our operating results before the impact of investing transactions, financing transactions and income taxes. Management has historically adjusted EBITDAR when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. 
 
 The following table presents total revenues and Adjusted EBITDAR by our Reportable Segments and our Managed Other category to reconcile to total revenues and total Adjusted EBITDAR:

 Las Vegas Locals 
 Total revenues decreased by 10.0 million, or 4.5 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the prior year comparable period, due primarily to a 9.5 million decline in gaming revenues. The decrease in gaming revenues was attributable to declines in table game hold of 3.1 , table game drop of 6.0 , slot handle of 6.4 and slot win of 5.0 from the prior year comparable period. As discussed earlier, the Las Vegas Locals segment was impacted by competitive pressures with a new competitor entering the market in December 2023. Absent these competitive pressures that have impacted two of our properties, the rest of the Las Vegas Locals segment performed in-line with the overall same-store market.

The decrease in gaming revenues was attributable to declines in table game hold of 8.9 , table game drop of 2.3 , slot handle of 5.1 and slot win of 4.3 from the prior year comparable period. As discussed earlier, the Las Vegas Locals segment was impacted by competitive pressures with a new competitor entering the market in December 2023 and overall market softness in the first quarter. Offsetting the decline in gaming revenues, was an increase in room revenue of 2.2 million, which was driven by an increase in hotel occupancy rate of 1.7 . 
 
 Adjusted EBITDAR decreased by 9.6 million, or 9.0 , and 34.4 million, or 9.8 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the prior year comparable period, due primarily to the gaming revenues decline discussed above.

Room revenues increased 2.0 million as the hotel occupancy rate increased 8.3 and food beverage revenues increased 1.6 million as average guest check increased 4.1 . In addition, gaming revenues increased 1.3 million primarily due to increases in table game drop of 12.3 , slot win of 4.5 and slot handle of 3.2 . These increases were primarily attributable to our recently completed renovation and expansion at the Fremont Hotel Casino and the hotel remodel at Main Street Station Hotel and Casino. 

Adjusted EBITDAR increased by 
 0.7
 million, or 
 4.1 
 , during the three months ended 
 September 30, 2024
 , as compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily due to the revenue increase discussed above as the segment benefited from our recent property investments and growth in Hawaiian visitation, both as discussed above. 

Adjusted EBITDAR decreased by 
 1.5
 million, or 
 2.6 
 , during the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2024
 , compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily due to wage increases as we completed our efforts in 2023 to increase the hourly minimum rate to 15 per hour for all non-tipped, non-represented positions and also property insurance cost increases. 

Midwest South 
 Total revenues increased by 9.4 million, or 1.8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year, reflecting revenue increases in all departmental categories. Gaming revenues increased 7.2 million primarily due to increases in table game hold of 9.5 . Food beverage revenue increased 1.9 million, which was driven by a 9.7 increase in average guest check, offset by a 7.1 decrease in food covers. These increases were driven by a record third quarter performance at Treasure Chest, which opened its new land-based casino in June 2024. 
 
 Total revenues increased by 0.9 million, or 0.1 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily due to a 7.9 million increase in food beverage revenues. The increase in food beverage revenues was primarily attributable to a 7.4 increase in average guest check. Offsetting the food beverage revenue increase, was a gaming revenue decrease of 7.8 million, which was primarily driven by the severe winter storms across the segment in the first quarter of 2024, specifically January. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA R increased by 6.3 million, or 3.3 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the gaming revenue increase discussed above. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDAR decreased by 17.8 million, or 3.0 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily due to gaming revenue declines, property insurance increases and wage increases as we increased the minimum wage in the prior year, all as discussed above. 
 
 Online 
 Online revenue increased 51.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the prior year comparable period, primarily driven by an increase of 31.8 million in reimbursements of gaming taxes and other expenses paid on behalf of our online partners, a 13.2 million increase in revenue under our market access agreements and a 6.1 million increase in revenue from Boyd Interactive's operations, inclusive of Resorts Digital upon Acquisition.

 Adjusted EBITDAR increased 15.0 million and 18.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, due primarily to revenues under our market access agreements and continued growth from Boyd Interactive. We received non-recurring market access fees of 10.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 that contributed to the year over year Adjusted EBITDAR growth. As discussed earlier, there is an equal amount of expense recorded for the revenue recorded related to the reimbursement of gaming taxes and other expenses, thus resulting in no impact to Adjusted EBITDAR.

 2023
 , respectively. The decline in selling, g eneral and administrative expens
 es, 
 as a p ercentage of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year comparable period is primarily driven by an increase in revenues as selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at 102.4 million and 99.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 While we continue to focus on our disciplined operating model and targeted marketing approach, and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was consistent year over year, selling, general and administrative expenses were impacted by increased wages and property insurance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 3.9 and 
 4.1 during the
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
 2023, respectively. The decline in maintenance and utilities expenses, as a percentage of re

 tegic initiatives, dispositions and other business development activities in the ordinary course of business; (ii) certain costs of start-up activities that are expensed as incurred in our ongoing efforts to develop gaming activities in new jurisdictions and expenses related to other new business development activities that do not qualify as capital costs; (iii) asset writedowns; and (iv) realized gains arising from asset dispositions. Such costs are generally nonrecurring in nature and vary from period to period as the volume of underlying activities fluctuates. During the three months ended

 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest and interest income, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , increased 5.0 million, or 12.4 , from the prior year comparable period primarily due to a 3.9 million increase in interest expense, which was attributable to an increase in the weighted average long-term debt balance of 120.6 million. In addition, interest income declined 1.2 million due to a reduction in interest earned on the Wilton Note during the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as the principal outstanding under the Wilton Note was fully repaid in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest and interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , increased 23.7 million, or 22.3 , from the prior year comparable period primarily due to a 21.2 million interest income decline driven by a reduction of the allowance for the expected loss for interest on the Wilton Note and interest earned on such note during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . With the full repayment of outstanding principal under the Wilton Note during the first quarter of 2024, interest earnings related to the Wilton Note were minimal in the current year. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 24.0 and 17.6 , respectively. Our tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was unfavorably impacted by state taxes, nondeductible expenses, including nondeductible compensation and employee benefit expenses, which were partially offset by excess tax benefits and tax credits. Our tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , was favorably impacted by a second quarter 2023 release of state valuation allowances and the inclusion of excess tax benefits which were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of state taxes and certain nondeductible expenses, as a component of the provision for income taxes. 
 
 The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has selected our federal corporate income tax return for the tax year ended December 31, 2021, for examination. The IRS examination began in the second quarter of 2024 and is early in the process. As of September 30, 2024, and for the three and nine months then ended, there were no changes to our unrecognized tax benefits to date. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Financial Position 
 We generally operate with minimal or negative levels of working capital in order to minimize borrowings and related interest costs. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had balances of cash and cash equivalents of 286.3 million and 304.3 million, respectively. In addition, we held restricted cash balances of 3.9 million and 3.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our working capital deficit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, wa s 108.7 million and 67.0 million, respectively. 
 
 We believe that current cash balances together with the available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in " Indebtedness " below) and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital resource needs for the next twelve months, including our projected operating requirements and maintenance capital expenditures. See " Indebtedness ", below, for further detail regarding funds available through our Credit Facility. 
 
 The Company may also seek to secure additional working capital, repay respective current debt maturities, or fund respective maintenance capital or development projects, in whole or in part, through incremental bank financing and additional debt or equity offerings, to the extent such offerings are allowed under our debt agreements.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we generated consistent operating cash flows of 695.0 million and 697.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Our industry is capital intensive and we use cash flows for acquisitions, facility expansions, investments in future development or business opportunit ies and maintenance capital expenditures. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we incurred net cash outflows for investing activities of 320.5 million comprised of capital expenditures of 289.2 million, primarily related to our Treasure Chest land-based casino project, various guest room remodels, slot machines, IT equipment and building projects at various properties. Investing cash outflow was also impacted by net cash paid of 28.8 million related to the acquisition of Resorts Digital. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we incurred net cash outflows for investing activities of 199.6 million comprised of capital expenditures of 279.0 million, primarily related to our Treasure Chest land-based casino project, Fremont food hall and slot floor expansion and renovation, various guest room remodels, IT equipment and building projects at various properties, offset by 82.4 million in payments received related to the outstanding principal on the Wilton Note. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 We rely on our financing cash flows to provide funding for investment opportunities, repayments of obligations, returning capital to shareholders and ongoing operations. 
 
 The net cash outflows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , primarily reflect share repurchases, net payments on the outstanding principal under our Credit Facility or incremental borrowings under our Credit Facility, share-based compensation and dividends paid. During the second and third quarters of 2024, we increased borrowings under the Credit Facility as we increased our share repurchase activity during the same periods, resulting in net borrowings under the Credit Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

With a total revolving credit commitment of 1,450.0 million available under the Credit Facility, 380.0 million and 44.6 million in borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Swing Loan, respectively, and 13.0 million allocated to support various letters of credit, there was a remaining contractual availability under the Credit Facility of 1,012.4 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The blended interest rate for outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was 6.7 and 7.2 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Debt Service Requirements 
 Debt service requirements for the Term A Loan include amortization in an annual amount equal to 5.00 of the original principal amount thereof, payable on a quarterly basis. Additionally, under the Credit Facility we have monthly to quarterly interest payment obligations, depending on the rates we lock in, for the Term A Loan, unused line interest payments and any outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, including the Swing Loan. Debt service requirements under our current outstanding senior notes consist of semi-annual interest payments (based upon a fixed annual interest rate of 4.750 and principal repayments of our 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.750 Senior Notes due 2027 ("4.750 Senior Notes due 2027") and our 0.9 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.750 Senior Notes due 2031 ("4.750 Senior Notes due 2031"). 
 
 Covenant Compliance 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of our debt instruments. 
 
 The indentures governing the senior notes contain provisions that allow for the incurrence of additional indebtedness, if after giving effect to such incurrence, the fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the respective indentures, which is a ratio of our consolidated EBITDA to fixed charges, including interest) for the trailing four quarter period on a pro forma basis would be at least 2.0 to 1.0. Should this provision prohibit the incurrence of additional debt, we may still borrow under our existing Credit Facility to the extent that borrowing capacity remains under that agreement, as well as from other funding sources as provided under our debt agreements. 
 
 Guarantor Financial Information 
 In connection with the issuance of our 4.750 Senior Notes due 2027 and our 4.750 Senior Notes due 2031 (collectively, the "Guaranteed Notes" or "Senior Notes"), certain of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") provide guarantees of those indentures. These Guaranteed Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, all of which are 100 owned by us.

Share Repurchase Program 
 On October 21, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of 300.0 million (the "Share Repurchase Program"). In addition, our Board of Directors authorized increases to the Share Repurchase Program of 500.0 million on each of June 1, 2022, May 4, 2023 and May 9, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we were authorized to repurchase up to an additional 343.1 million in shares of our common stock under the Share Repurchase Program. We repurchased 3.5 million and 1.6 million shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 8.3 million and 4.8 million shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Subject to applicable laws, repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program may be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate. We are subject to certain limitations regarding the repurchase of common stock, such as restricted payment limitations related to our outstanding Senior Notes and our Credit Facility. We are not obligated to repurchase any shares under this program, and purchases under the Share Repurchase Program can be discontinued at any time at our sole discretion. We intend to fund the repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program with existing cash resources, cash generated from operations and availability under our Credit Facility. 
 
 We have in the past, and may in the future, acquire our debt or equity securities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, redemptions or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine.

Other Items Affecting Liquidity 
 We anticipate funding our capital requirements using cash on hand, cash being generated from our operations and availability under our Credit Facility, to the extent borrowing capacity exists after we meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months. Any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on terms favorable to us. The outcome of the specific matters discussed herein, including our commitments and contingencies, may also affect our liquidity. 
 
 Commitments 
 Capital Spending and Development 
 We currently estimate that our annual cash capital requirements to perform ongoing refurbishment and maintenance at our properties is approximately 200 million to 250 million. In addition, we expect to spend an additional 75 million in 2024 for hotel renovation projects at six of our gaming entertainment properties. We intend to fund our capital expenditures through cash on hand, operating cash flows and availability under our Credit Facility. 
 
 In addition to the maintenance capital spending discussed above, we continue to pursue other potential development projects that may require us to invest significant amounts of capital as well as capital spend required for identified growth projects. We expect to spend 100 million in 2024 on such growth projects, which includes the completion of the new land-based facility at Treasure Chest, which opened in June 2024, the expansion of meeting and convention space at Ameristar St. Charles and the start of construction of a new casino, Cadence Crossing. This new 10,000 square foot casino featuring 450 slots and several restaurants will replace our Jokers Wild casino and will be built on the site that currently holds our Jokers Wild casino. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the company spent approximately 289 million of the total estimated 400 million to 425 million of capital spend expected in 2 024. 
 
 Other Opportunities 
 We regularly investigate and pursue additional expansion opportunities in markets where casino gaming, including online gaming, is currently permitted. We also pursue expansion opportunities in jurisdictions where casino and online gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino or online gaming. Such expansions will be affected and determined by several key factors, which may include the following: 

the outcome or anticipated outcome of gaming license selection processes; 

the approval of gaming in jurisdictions where we have been active but where casino or online gaming is not currently permitted; 

identification of additional suitable investment opportunities in current gaming jurisdictions; and 

availability of acceptable financing. 

Additional projects may require us to make substantial investments or may cause us to incur substantial costs related to the investigation and pursuit of such opportunities, which we may fund through cash on hand, cash flow from operations or availability under our Credit Facility. To the extent such sources of funds are not sufficient, we may also seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources to the extent such financing is available. 
 
 After receiving approval from the City Council of Norfolk, Virginia in October 2024, we are executing on an opportunity for a new casino resort development in Norfolk, Virginia. We expect to open a small temporary facility in late 2025 and a permanent facility in late 2027. We currently expect the permanent facility will feature a 200-room hotel, eight food and beverage outlets and a casino with 1,500 slots and 50 table games. While we are still finalizing construction and development costs, we currently expect overall project costs of approximately 750 million. 
 
 Contingencies 
 Legal Matters 
 We are parties to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that all pending claims, if adversely decided, would not have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Such statements contain words such as "may," "will," "might," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "could," "would," "estimate," "pursue," "target," "project," "intend," "plan," "seek," "should," "assume," and "continue," or the negative thereof or comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in any such statement. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include: 

the general effect, and expectation, of the national and global economy on our business, including but not limited to interest rates and inflationary pressures, as well as the economies where each of our properties are located; 

the factors that contribute to our ongoing success and our ability to be successful in the future; 

our business model, areas of focus and strategy for driving business results; 

our ability to maintain the integrity of our information technology systems and to protect our internal information; 

impacts caused by public health emergencies and man-made or natural disasters we may encounter; 

competition, including expansion of gaming into additional markets including online gaming, the impact of competition on our operations, our ability to respond to such competition, and our expectations regarding continued competition in the markets in which we compete; 

our expectation regarding the trends that will affect the gaming industry over the next few years and the impact of these trends on growth of the gaming industry, future development opportunities and merger and acquisition activity in general; 

our intention to pursue expansion opportunities, including acquisitions, that are a good fit for our business, deliver a solid return for stockholders, and are available at the right price; 

our compliance with government regulations, including our ability to receive and maintain necessary approvals for our projects; 

that our credit agreement and our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our respective projected operating and maintenance capital expenditures for the next twelve months; 

indebtedness, including our ability to refinance or pay amounts outstanding under our credit agreement and our unsecured notes, when they become due and our compliance with related covenants, and our expectation that we will need to refinance all or a portion of our respective indebtedness at or before maturity; 

our belief that all pending litigation claims, if adversely decided, will not have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows; 

our estimates and expectations regarding anticipated taxes, tax credits or tax refunds; 

our expectations regarding the expansion of sports betting and online wagering; 

our asset impairment analyses and our intangible asset and goodwill impairment tests; 

the likelihood of interruptions to our rights in the land we lease under long-term leases for certain of our hotels and casinos; 

that estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles may differ from actual results; and 

our estimates as to the effect of any changes in our Consolidated EBITDA on our ability to remain in compliance with certain covenants in the credit agreement. 

Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other current and periodic reports filed from time to time with the SEC. All forward-looking statements in this document are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk, specifically long-term U.S. treasury rates and the applicable spreads in the high-yield investment market, short-term and long-term SOFR rates, and their potential impact on our long-term debt. We are exposed to a lesser extent to foreign currency exchange risk for funds held in our Canadian operating and restricted cash accounts. While there is risk of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and US dollar, our exposure is limited given the size of our Canadian operations and the minimal amount of cash held in Canadian bank accounts. A weakening or strengthening of the US dollar to the Canadian dollar by 2x the current conversion rate, would not cause the value of the funds held in the Canadian operating and restricted cash accounts to change significantly. We do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our long-term variable-rate borrowings represented appro ximately 38.6 of tot al long-term debt. Based on September 30, 2024 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in the interest rate would cause our annual interest costs on variable-rate borrowings to change by approximately 11.9 million. We believe there have been no other material changes in our exposure to market risks as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Report"), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
 
 As discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023, due to the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as further discussed below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a ma terial misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the fourth quarter of 2023, management identified a material weakness related to the preparation and independent review of journal entries, which resulted in a lack of segregation of duties over the preparation, review, and recording of journal entries. The failure to maintain appropriate segregation of duties had a pervasive impact and consequently, this deficiency impacted control activities over all financial statement account balances, classes of transactions, and disclosures. 
 
 Remediation Efforts to Address the Material Weakness 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. With the oversight of senior management, subsequent to December 31, 2023, a plan to remediate the underlying cause of the material weakness and improve the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls was developed and was implemented. During the first quarter of 2024, we executed on all elements of our remediation plan as defined below and in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024. We continued to reinforce remediation efforts during the second and third quarters of 2024 and monitored operating effectiveness. As of September 30, 2024, management concluded that while no instances of improper segregation of duties over journal entries were identified, management will continue to monitor operating effectiveness through the fourth quarter before concluding on remediation of the material weakness. Specifically, the following remediation efforts occurred to ensure there were appropriate levels of independent reviews of journal entries, in order to address proper segregation of duties, including: 

Educating control owners to ensure that all design elements of the journal entry control are performed; 

Implementing additional attestations within our existing quarterly self-assessment process that address and reinforce proper segregation of duties over journal entries; and 

Enhancing our monitoring control that verifies that journal entries have a separate preparer and independent reviewer. 

We believe these actions have meaningfully strengthened our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except as disclosed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
