the Company s outstanding stock options and warrants were similarly adjusted along with corresponding adjustments to their exercise
prices. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock under the Certificate of Incorporation will remain unchanged at shares.

Company Overview and Description of Business 

Overview 

We are a FinTech company that focuses on a suite
of products in the merchant services marketplace that seeks to provide integrated business solutions to merchants throughout the United States.
We seek to accomplish this by providing merchants with a wide range of products and services through our various online platforms, including
financial and transaction processing services. We also have products that provide support for crowdfunding and other capital raising initiatives.
We supplement our online platforms with certain hardware solutions that are integrated with our online platforms. Our business functions
primarily through three wholly-owned subsidiaries, eVance, OmniSoft, and CrowdPay, though substantially all of our revenue has been
generated from our eVance business (we began generating revenue from our OmniSoft and CrowdPay businesses in the second half of 2019).
We expect to build out our OmniSoft software business and to rely more on individualized merchant services offerings for revenue so that
we are not dependent on our revenue from our eVance business but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. 

With respect to our eVance business, our merchants
are currently processing over 100,000,000 in gross transactions monthly and average approximately 1,400,000 transactions a month. These
transactions come from a variety of sources including direct accounts and ISO channels. The accounts consist of businesses across the
United States with no concentration of industries or merchants. 

We have integrated all the applications for OmniSoft
and the ShopFast Omnicommerce solution with the eVance mobile payment gateway, SecurePay.comTM. SecurePay.comTM, is currently used by
approximately 3,000 merchants processing over 32,000 transactions and approximately 9,000,000 of monthly gross transactions (though our
revenue from these transactions is limited). In July 2019, we launched a new merchant and ISO boarding system that will be able to onboard
merchants instantly. This provides the merchant with an automated approval and ISOs will have the ability to see all their merchants and
their residuals as they load to the system.

On May 22, 2020, the Company purchased certain
assets from POSaBIT Inc. POSaBIT ), including its contracts and arrangements with the Doublebeam merchant payment processing

the mining of Bitcoin. DMINT initiated the first phase of the Bitcoin mining operation by placing data centers and ASIC-based Antminer
S19J Pro mining computers specifically configured to mine Bitcoin in Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2022, DMINT had purchased 1,000
computers. In February 2023, it re-deployed all of the computers to its Selmer, Tennessee location. At September 30, 2024, DMINT had mined
31.06 Bitcoin. On October 21, 2024, DMINT filed a Registration Statement

 CI Issued Shares ). The value of the CI Issued Shares was, for purposes of the Agreement, based on the closing trading price
of the Company on October 1, 2021 (the date on which a third-party fairness opinion was issued), resulting in an aggregate purchase price
for Crowd Ignition of 5.3 million. 

Crowd Ignition is a web-based crowdfunding software

of Crowd Ignition. The software provides broker-dealer, merchant banks and law firms a platform to market crowdfunding offerings, collect
payments and issue securities. The software has been developed in response to, and to comply with, recent changes in investment regulations
including Regulation D 506(b) and 506(v), Regulation A+ and Title III of the Jobs Act (Regulation CF), including raising the crowdfunding
limit from 1.07 million to 5.0 million. Crowd Ignition is one of only about 50 companies registered with the SEC to provide the services
permitted under Regulation CF. 

On June 15, 2023, the Company entered into
a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Agreement with SDI Black 001, LLC Seller whereby it acquired
80.01 of the membership interests of Moola Cloud, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (formerly Cuentas SDI, LLC, the LLC )..

Critical Accounting Policies 

Refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, for a full discussion of our critical accounting policies. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the
end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the required time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors or fraud.
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The Company is engaged in ongoing litigation with
FFS relating to a breach of contract in connection with the Acquired Merchant Portfolio whereby the Company is making a claim to recover
the purchase price of the Acquired Merchant Portfolio and FFS is claiming to be paid the full purchase price of the Acquired Merchant
Portfolio. In addition, in connection with the litigation with FFS, the Company has also made a claim against Clear Fork Bank (the Bank ),
the payment processing bank for the Acquired Merchant Portfolio, for damages the Company suffered as a result of it having to cease processing
transactions for the merchants underlying the Acquired Merchant Portfolio. The Bank has filed a counterclaim for fees incurred by it in
connection with the transactions processed since the acquisition of the Acquired Merchant Portfolio by the Company. However, the damages
claimed have been materially reduced over time due to account balancing which was not completed at the time of the counterclaim. 

DMINT is currently in a contract dispute with
a contractor. The Company has paid 100,000 to the contractor for work completed and materials provided and returned materials to offset
the potential liability of approximately 444,000. The Company has recorded just over 315,000 in accounts payable related to the matter.
The matter continues to be in discovery; however, the parties continue to discuss settlement. The parties are working on a payment schedule
but have been unable to agree on terms to date. 

Other than discussed above, there are no
material claims, actions, suits, proceedings, or investigations that are currently pending or, to the Company s knowledge, threatened
by or against the Company or respecting its operations or assets, or by or against any of the Company s officers, directors, or
affiliates.
