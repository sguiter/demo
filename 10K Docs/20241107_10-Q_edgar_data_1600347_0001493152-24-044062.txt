 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

and has net working capital deficit of at
September 30, 2024. Management has evaluated the significance of the conditions in relation to the Company s ability to meet its
obligations and believes that its current cash balance along with its current operations will not provide sufficient capital to continue
as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving sales growth, management of
operating expenses and ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities arising
from normal business operations when they come due, and upon profitable operations. 

Our
majority shareholder has advised us not to depend solely on them for financing. The Company has increased its efforts to raise additional
capital through equity or debt financings from other sources. However, the Company cannot be certain that such capital (from its shareholders
or third parties) will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to the Company. Any
such financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants that would
negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have insufficient
funds to operate our business or pursue our planned growth. 

In
considering our forecast for the next twelve months and the current cash and working capital as of the filing of this Form 10-Q, such
matters create a substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to meet their financial needs and continue as a going concern.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts,
or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.

Company evaluates goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment
exist. Such indicators could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate,
(2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. The Company first assesses qualitative factors
to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management
conducts a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit
with its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of the income, or discounted
cash flows, approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies data. If the carrying amount of a reporting
unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the
total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit

Background
and business 

Hapi
Metaverse Inc., formerly known as GigWorld Inc. (the Company or Group ), was incorporated in the State of
Delaware on March 7, 2012. The Company s initial business plan was to be a financial acquisition intermediary which would serve
buyers and sellers for companies that are in highly fragmented industries. Our Board determined it was in the best interest of the Company
to expand our business plan. On October 15, 2014, through a sale and purchase agreement, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding
stock of HotApp BlockChain Pte. Ltd., formerly known as HotApps International Pte Ltd HIP from Alset International Limited AIL ), formerly known as Singapore eDevelopment Limited. AIL is our former largest stockholder. HIP owned certain intellectual
property relating to instant messaging for portable devices (referred to herein as the HotApp Application ). On August 30,
2022, AIL entered into a stock purchase agreement with its controlling stockholder, Alset Inc. (formerly known as Alset EHome International
Inc.) in relation to the disposal of 505,341,376 shares of the Company s common stock, representing approximately 99.69 of the
total issued and paid-up share capital of the Company, to Alset Inc. After this transaction, Alset Inc. became our largest stockholder. 

The
HotApp Application is a cross-platform mobile application that incorporates instant messaging and eCommerce. This application can be
used on any mobile platform (i.e. IOS Online or Android). The HotApp Application offered messaging and calling services for HotApp Application
users (text, photo, audio); however, the messaging and calling services we offered were terminated in 2017. 

In
December of 2017, the Company s name was changed from HotApp International, Inc. to HotApp Blockchain Inc. 
to reflect the Board of Directors determination that it was in the best interest of the Company to expand its activities to include
the development and commercialization of blockchain-related technologies. 

In
2018, one of our main developments was a broadening of our scope of planned operations into a digital transformation technology business.
As a digital transformation technology business, we are committed to enabling enterprises we work with to engage in a digital transformation
by providing consulting, implementation and development services with various technologies, including instant messaging, blockchain,
eCommerce, social media and payment solutions. We continue to advise businesses in network marketing and brands in block chain services
and mobile collaboration. 

21 

We
are focused on serving business-to-business (B2B) needs in eCommerce, collaboration and supply chains. We will help enterprises and community
users to transform their business models with digital economy in a more effective manner. With our platform, users can discover and build
their own communities and create valuable content. Enterprises can in turn enhance the user experience with premium content, all of which
are facilitated by the transactions of every stakeholder via eCommerce. 

Our
technology platform consists of instant messaging systems, social media, eCommerce and payment systems, and network marketing platforms.
We are focused on business-to-business solutions such as enterprise messaging and workflow. We have successfully implemented several
strategic platform developments for clients, including a mobile front-end solution for network marketing, a hotel eCommerce platform
for Asia and a real estate agent management platform in China. We have also enhanced our technological capability from mobile application
development to include blockchain architectural design, allowing mobile-friendly front-end solutions to integrate with software platforms.
Our main digital assets at the present time are our applications. We continue to strengthen our technology architecture and develop Application
Development Interface (API) for collaboration partners such as network marketing back end service providers. In addition, we are continuing
our development activities in blockchain in order to prepare for future client opportunities. 

In
February of 2021, the Company s name was changed to GigWorld Inc. 

The
Group has relied significantly on AIL, our former majority stockholder, as its principal source of funding during the period. AIL, and
later, our current majority stockholder, Alset Inc., advised us not to depend solely on it for financing. We have increased our efforts
to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings from other sources. However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from
our stockholders or third parties) will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are acceptable to
us. Any such, financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial operating covenants
that would negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have
insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned growth.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, we had cash of 769,793 and a working capital deficit of 5,877,897. The increase in the working capital deficit
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the increase in the loss on investment in securities. 

We
had a total stockholders deficit of 5,989,559 and an accumulated deficit of 16,656,146 as of September 30, 2024 compared with
a total stockholders deficit of 2,563,665 and an accumulated deficit of 13,414,222 as of December 31, 2023. This difference
is primarily due to the net loss incurred during the period. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net loss of 3,242,710. 

We
had net cash used in operating activities of 832,592 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We had a negative change of 66,060
due to related parties accounts receivable, 191,298 due to change in operating lease liability, 25,686 due to accounts payable and
accrued expenses and 3,827 due to account receivable in trade. A positive change of 2,018,536 due to unrealized loss on security investment,

gain on security investment. A positive change of 105,517 in non-cash lease expenses and 15,124 due to accounts payable and accrued
expenses. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash used in investing activities of 141,001, of which 110,000 negative change
was due to issuance of convertible loan receivable to related party and 36,632 was due to purchase of property and equipment, 5,631
positive change was due to the acquisition of HCTW. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net cash used in investing activities

As
of September 30, 2024, we have fixed operating office lease agreements in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the People s Republic of China. 

We
will need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings. However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from our largest
shareholder or third parties) will be available to us or whether such capital will be available on a term that is acceptable to us. Any
such financing likely would be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in significant financial and operating covenants that
would negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have insufficient
funds to operate our business and pursue our business plan. 

We
have included disclosures which discuss the matters which create substantial doubt as to whether we will be able to continue to operate
as a going concern, including the facts that the Company has incurred net operating losses of 16,656,146 from inception though September
30, 2024 and has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining the adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.
If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved
in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be
our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates
we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances,
including the policies for revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and income taxes. These policies
require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. 

Within
the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would
result in materially different amounts being reported. 

Revenue
recognition 

Accounting
Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), establishes principles for reporting information
about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity s contracts to provide goods
or services or catering service to customers. 

Revenue
is recognized when (or as) the Company transfers promised goods or services or catering service to its customers in amounts that reflect
the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services, which occurs when (or as) the
Company satisfies its contractual obligations and transfers over control of the promised goods or services or catering service to its
customers. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined
to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services
or catering service in the contract by analyzing customer perspective, immateriality, implicit promises, setup activities, and
marketing incentives ; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services or catering
service are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract by analyze the contract from the
perspective of the customer; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration by the expected
value method and the most likely amount method; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on a relative
stand-alone selling price basis, or the price at which the Company would sell the good or service separately to similar customers in
similar circumstances; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. This should only
be done once the transaction is complete and your obligation is fulfilled. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts
when it is probable that the entity will collect consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services or catering service
it transfers to the customer. 

Costs
to obtain or fulfill a contract are expensed as incurred. 

The
Company began generating revenue from the F B business by providing quality catering services in Hong Kong since October 2022, in
the People s Republic of China PRC since January 2023, and in Taiwan since April 2024. 

The
Company had a project providing services to Value Exchange Int l (Hong Kong) Limited, a subsidiary of Value Exchange International,
Inc. located in Hong Kong, on a monthly basis in 2022. VEII is a related party of the Company. Upon receipt of purchase order from this
customer, we issue the corresponding invoice and provide the service accordingly. Any payment received from this customer in advance
is presented within other payables on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. This service was terminated on June 30, 2023 and
 0 of contract liabilities remained as of September 30, 2024. The balance of customer deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023 was 0, September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022 was 0, and 2,802, respectively. 

In
June 2023, the Company acquired a travel business and began generating revenue by providing travel packaging and ticketing services in
Hong Kong.

Transfers
of Cash to and from Our Subsidiaries 

Our
equity structure is a direct holding company structure. Within our direct holding company structure, the cross-border transfer of funds
between our corporate entities is legal and compliant with the laws and regulations of the PRC. After the foreign investors funds
enter HMI, the funds can be directly transferred to the PRC operating companies through its subsidiaries. Specifically, HMI is permitted
under the Delaware laws to provide funding to our subsidiary, HCHK, in Hong Kong through loans or capital contributions without restrictions
on the amount of the funds, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration, approval and filing requirements. HCHK is
also permitted under the laws of Hong Kong to provide funding to HMI through dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount
of the funds. As of the date hereof, there have not been any dividends or distributions made between the holding company, its subsidiaries,
and to investors. HCHK is also permitted by the laws of the PRC to provide funding in the form of loans or capital injection to HCCN
and its subsidiaries for their daily operations. 

We
currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and do not
anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will
be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements,
contractual requirements, business prospects and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant, and subject to the restrictions
contained in any future financing instruments. Subject to the Delaware General Corporation Law and our bylaws, our Board of Directors
may authorize and declare a dividend to shareholders at such time and of such an amount as it thinks fit if they are satisfied, on reasonable
grounds, that immediately following the dividend the value of our assets will exceed our liabilities and we will be able to pay our debts
as they become due. 

To
address persistent capital outflows and the RMB s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the People s
Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, have implemented a series of capital control measures in the
subsequent months, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based companies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions,
dividend payments and shareholder loan repayments. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiaries 
dividends and other distributions may be subject to tightened scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the
conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties
in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits,
if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict
their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations,
we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock. 

Cash
dividends, if any, on our common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes,
any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding
tax at up to 10 . 

As
of the date hereof, our PRC subsidiaries have not made any transfers or distributions. As of the date hereof, no cash or asset transfers
have occurred between the Company and its subsidiaries. We do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Furthermore,
as of the date hereof, no cash generated from one subsidiary is used to fund another subsidiary s operations and we do not anticipate
any difficulties or limitations on our ability to transfer cash between subsidiaries. We have also not installed any cash management
policies that dictate the amount of such funds and how such funds are transferred. 

PRC
Regulations 

In
accordance with PRC regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment and their articles of association, a foreign-invested enterprise FIE established in the PRC is required to provide statutory reserves, which are appropriated from net profit, as reported
in the FIE s PRC statutory accounts. A FIE is required to allocate at least 10 of its annual after-tax profit to the surplus reserve
until such reserve has reached 50 of its respective registered capital (based on the FIE s PRC statutory accounts). The aforementioned
reserves may only be used for specific purposes and may not be distributed as cash dividends. Until such contribution of capital is satisfied,
the FIE is not allowed to repatriate profits to its stockholders, unless approved by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. After
satisfaction of this requirement, the remaining funds may be appropriated at the discretion of the FIE s board of directors. Our
subsidiary HCCN is the PRC holding company of the other two PRC subsidiaries, and qualifies as a FIE and is therefore subject to the
above-mandated regulations on distributable profits. 

Additionally,
in accordance with PRC corporate law, a domestic enterprise is required to maintain a surplus reserve of at least 10 of its annual after-tax
profit until such reserve has reached 50 of its respective registered capital based on the enterprise s PRC statutory accounts.
The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and may not be distributed as cash dividends. HCDG is the subsidiary
of HCCN that conducts operations in China and HCGZ is the subsidiary of HCCN that does not conduct any operations in China, were established
as domestic enterprises; therefore, each is subject to the above-mentioned restrictions on distributable profits. 

As
a result of PRC laws and regulations that require annual appropriations of 10 of after-tax income to be set aside, prior to payment
of dividends, in a general reserve fund, the Company s PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of
their net assets to the Company as a dividend or otherwise. 

28 

Income
taxes 

Current
income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred income taxes are recognized when
temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the condensed consolidated
financial statements. Net operating loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future
years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that a
portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually
classified as non-current based on their characteristics. 

The
impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return is recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than
a 50 likelihood of being sustained. Interest and penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the provisions for income
taxes. The Group did not recognize any income tax due to uncertain tax position or incur any interest and penalties related to potential
underpaid income tax expenses for the period ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, respectively.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In
connection with the preparation of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

During
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 conducted as part of our preparation of our interim financial
statements, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures
and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Management determined that at September 30, 2024, we had
material weaknesses: 1) in our internal control over financial reporting because our small accounting team; 2) lack of higher-level supervisory
or review function, currently furnished by a related-party, manages both bookkeeping and accounting functions and therefore prevents
us from segregating duties within our internal control system.
