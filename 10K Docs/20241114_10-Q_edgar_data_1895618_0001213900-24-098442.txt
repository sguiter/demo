CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Any statements in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical
facts and are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as
 believe, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, 
 plan and would. For example, statements concerning financial condition, possible or assumed future results
of operations, growth opportunities, industry ranking, plans and objectives of management, markets for our common stock and future management
and organizational structure are all forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to differ materially from any results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement. 

Any forward-looking statements are qualified in
their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the risks, uncertainties
and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to: 

our ability to obtain additional funds for our operations; 

our financial performance, including our revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses, and our ability to attain and sustain profitability; 

our ability to attract and retain users; 

our ability to attract and retain advertisers; 

our ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants; 

our ability to successfully expand in our existing markets and penetrate new markets; 

our expectations regarding the time during which we will be an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act; 

our ability to effectively manage our growth, and future expenses; 

our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property; 

our ability to comply with modified or new laws and regulations applying to our business, competitors and industry; 

our ability to attract and retain qualified key management and technical personnel; 

other risks and uncertainties, including those listed under the caption Risk Factors. 

The foregoing list sets forth some, but not all,
of the factors that could affect our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. You should read this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference herein and have filed as exhibits to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, completely
and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. You should assume that the
information appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is accurate as of the date hereof. Because the risk factors referred to on
page 4 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially
from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking
statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake
no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made
or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which
factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination
of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We qualify all of the
information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and particularly our forward-looking statements, by these cautionary statements.

Inception ). On March 30, 2022, the Company reincorporated
to the State of Delaware pursuant to a Plan of Conversion approved by the Board of Directors and a majority of the shareholders. On January
5, 2024, the Company changed its name from The NFT Gaming Company, Inc. to Gaxos.ai Inc. The Company is a technology-based company that
is developing applications aimed at redefining the way we utilize artificial intelligence AI to optimize the user experience.
The Company s flagship product is its gaming platform called Gaxos (the Platform or Gaxos Gaming ),
created with a vision to develop, design, acquire, and manage conventional games and to combine these games with unconventional game mechanisms,
such as the ability for gamers and developers to utilize artificial intelligence to create and design in-game features, as well as to
mint unique in-game features, such as skins, characters, weapons, gear, levels, and virtual lands, in the form of non-fungible tokens,
or NFTs, that will allow users to have unique experiences and more control over in-game assets. Recently, we began to develop
a new initiative, Gaxos Health, which is dedicated to revolutionizing personal health and wellness by developing a suite of innovative
AI-powered health optimization solutions. 

On February 28, 2024, a majority of the Company
shareholders granted discretionary authority to the Company s Board of Directors to amend the Company s Certificate of Incorporation
to effect one or more consolidations of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, pursuant to which the shares
of common stock would be combined and reclassified into on the basis of one share of common stock for each 12 shares of the Company s
common stock then issued and outstanding (the Reverse Stock Split ). The Certificate of Amendment and the reverse stock split became effective on March 7, 2024. All share and per share data in the
accompanying financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. 

On
September 23, 2024, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, RNK Health, LLC RNK Health ), a company incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware as a limited liability company. RNK Health was formed in order to form a partnership and potential relationship
with Nekwellness, LLC Nekwellness ), a third party, to engage in the proposed business of marketing certain products, including
GLP-1 products GLP-1 is short for glucagon-like peptide-1),
TRT (Testosterone replacement therapy) products and other potential products. In October 2024, the Company and Nekwellness entered into

the Company obtained a license from Columbia with respect to software and intellectual property rights and patents. In connection with
the License Agreement, Columbia granted to the Company a royalty-bearing, exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable license under the License
Agreement, to discover, develop, manufacture, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, have sold, import, export, distribute, rent or lease
licensed products and copy, use, modify, and create derivative works from licensed software and technical information during the term

 New Warrants ), as described below, to purchase an aggregate of up to shares of the Company s common stock

share). 

The amendment to the March 2024 Common Warrants

Warrants under the guidance of ASU 2021-04. The modification is consistent with the Equity Issuance classification under
that guidance as the reason for the modification was to induce the holders to cash exercise their warrants, resulting in the exercise
of the March 2024 Common Warrants on September 20, 2024.

Warrants. As of September 30, 2024, of the Warrant Shares were held in abeyance and were not reflected as issued and outstanding
common shares on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with the terms of the inducement offer agreement. Pursuant
to the inducement offer agreement, the Company only issued such number of Warrant Shares to the Holder that would not cause the Holder
to exceed the maximum number of Warrant Shares permitted thereunder, as directed by the Holder, with the balance of the Warrant Shares
held in abeyance until notice from the Holder that the balance (or portion thereof) may be issued in compliance with the limitations set
forth in the inducement offer agreement, which abeyance shall be evidenced through the March 2024 Common Warrants which shall be deemed
prepaid thereafter (including the cash payment in full of the exercise price), and exercised pursuant to a Notice of Exercise in the March
2024 Common Warrants (provided no additional exercise price shall be due and payable). As of September 30, 2024, the Company issued 
Warrant Shares to the Holder, and Warrant Shares were held in abeyance for future issuance. Subsequent to September 30, 2024,
the Warrant Shares held in abeyance were issued (See Note 8).

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited financial statements contained herein
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP and the requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the
accompanying financial statements include valuation of investments, valuation of intangible assets and other long-lived assets,
estimates of deferred tax valuation allowances and the fair value of stock options issued for services. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates
made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had
or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We consider the following to be
critical accounting estimates. 

Intangible assets 

Intangible assets, consisting of software licenses
and technology licenses, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of 5 years, less any impairment charges. We test intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group to their carrying amount. If the carrying value of the assets
exceeds their estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss would be determined as the difference between the fair value
of the assets and its carrying value. Typically, the fair value of the assets would be determined using a discounted cash flow model which
would be sensitive to judgments of what constitutes an asset group and certain assumptions such as estimated future financial performance,
discount rates, and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. There have been no material
changes in the underlying assumptions and estimates used in these calculations in the relevant period. The accounting estimate related
to asset impairments is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about the
existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years. These assumptions impact the amount of an impairment, which could
materially adversely impact the statements of operations. 

Stock-based compensation 

Stock-based compensation is accounted for based
on the requirements of ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation , which requires recognition in the financial
statements of the cost of employee, non-employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the
period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The
ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date
fair value of the award. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur. We recognize compensation costs resulting
from the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, non-employees, and directors as an expense in the statements of operations over
the requisite service period based on a measurement of fair value for each stock-based award. The fair value of each option granted is
estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, net of actual forfeitures. The fair value is amortized
as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model includes various assumptions, including the fair market value of our common stock, expected
life of stock options, the expected volatility, and the expected risk-free interest rate, among others. These assumptions reflect our
best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control. As a result, if other
assumptions had been used, stock-based compensation expense, as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance, could have been
materially impacted. Furthermore, if we use different assumptions on future grants, stock-based compensation expense could be materially
affected in future periods.

reported research and development expense of 252,657 and 258,405, respectively, a decrease of 5,748, or 2.2 . The decrease is primarily
due to a decrease in outside development costs incurred in connection with the development of Gaxos Games offset by an increase in development
of the Gaxos Health platforms. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported research and development expense
of 684,327 and 630,574, respectively, an increase of 53,753, or 8.5 . The increase is primarily due to an increase in outside development
costs incurred in connection with the development of Gaxos Health platforms offset by a decrease in outside development costs incurred
in connection with the development of Gaxos Games. We expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as development
of Gaxos Games and Gaxos Health accelerates.

Compensation and related benefits 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, compensation and related benefits amounted to 172,502 and 208,365, respectively, a decrease of 35,863, or 17.2 . The decrease
during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to a
decrease in executive officer and employee compensation. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, compensation and related benefits amounted to 689,565 and 1,202,199, respectively, a decrease of 512,634, or 42.6 . The decrease
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease
in accretion of stock-based compensation related to issuance of stock options to executive officers, directors and employees of 640,537,
offset by an increase in executive officer and employee compensation of 127,903. 

Professional fees 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we incurred professional fees of 259,167 and 254,553, respectively, an increase of 4,614, or 1.8 , attributable to an increase
in advisory fees of 129,500, offset by a decrease in other professional fees of 124,886. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we incurred professional fees of 819,528 and 952,431, respectively, a decrease of 132,903, or 13.9 , attributable to a decrease
in stock-based consulting fees due to the accretion of stock options expense to consultants of 189,699, and a decrease in investor relations
fees of 328,050, offset by an increase in advisory fees of 306,695 and an increase in other professional fees of 78,151. 

Other general and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses consist of
advertising and marketing expenses, office expenses, insurance, listing fees, computer and interest expenses, travel expenses, amortization
expense, and other general business expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred general and administrative
expenses of 224,247 and 152,293, respectively, an increase of 71,954, or 47.2 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we incurred general and administrative expenses of 613,514 and 346,982, respectively, an increase of 266,532, or 76.8 . Generally,
the increase in other general and administrative expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to an increase in advertising and marketing expenses and a ramp
up of operations which began in February 2023 following the Company s IPO. 

Impairment loss 

On August 9, 2023 and effective August 1, 2023,
the Company and Columbia University agreed to the termination of the Software and Patent License Agreement between the Company and The
Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York, dated August 29, 2022. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2023, we wrote off the
remaining unamortized book value of the intangible asset of 52,363, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, recorded an
impairment loss of 52,363, which is included in operating expenses on the accompany statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 

Loss from operations 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we reported a loss from operations of 905,869 and 873,616, respectively, an increase of 32,253, or 3.7 . During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported a loss from operations of 2,804,211 and 3,184,549, respectively, a decrease of
 380,338, or 11.9 . The change in loss from operations was due to changes in general and administrative expenses, research and development,
and impairment loss as discussed above. 

- 21 - 

Other income 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, we reported other income of 41,459 and 16,557, respectively, an increase of 24,902, or 150.4 . This increase is attributable
to an increase in interest income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported other income of 218,418 and
 37,415, respectively, an increase of 181,003, or 483.8 . This increase is attributable to an increase in interest income of 59,238.
Additionally, we recorded a realized gain on short-term investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 121,765
and 0, respectively. 

Net loss 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, our net loss amounted to 864,410, or a net loss per common share of 0.61 (basic and diluted) and 857,059, or a net loss per
common share of 0.85 (basic and diluted), respectively, an increase of 7,351, or 0.86 . During the three months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, our total comprehensive loss amounted to 864,410 and 815,218, respectively, an increase of 49,192, or 6.0 . 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, our net loss amounted to 2,585,793, or a net loss per common share of 1.95 (basic and diluted) and 3,147,134, or a net loss
per common share of 3.20 (basic and diluted), respectively, a decrease of 561,341, or 17.8 . During the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, our total comprehensive loss amounted to 2,668,279 and 3,067,488, respectively, a decrease of 389,325, or 12.7 . 

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Plan of Operations 

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate
funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. On September 30,
2024, we had a cash balance of 5,227,894, had short-term investments of 1,416,056, and had working capital of 6,525,650. 

On March 13, 2024, we entered into a securities
purchase agreement (the March 2024 Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor the Purchaser for the issuance and sale in a private placement (the March 2024 Private Placement of aggregate Units consisting of (i)
108,000 shares of the Company s common stock, (ii) series A warrants to purchase up to 628,367 shares of the Company s common
stock (the Series A Warrants ), and (iii) series B warrants to purchase up to 628,367 shares of the Company s common
stock (the Series B Warrants and together with the Series A Warrants, the March 2024 Common Warrants ). The
purchase price of each Unit consisted of one share of the Company s common stock and associated March 2024 Common Warrants, was
 5.57 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of 601,560. Additionally, we sold pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 520,367 shares of
the Company s common stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants ). Pre-funded Warrants are a type of warrant that allows the warrant
holder to purchase a specified number of a company s securities at a nominal exercise price. The purchase price of each Pre-Funded
Warrant was 5.569 for aggregate gross proceeds of 2,897,924. In connection with this March 2024 Private Placement, we raised aggregate
gross proceeds of 3,499,484 consisting of 601,560 from the sales of common stock units and 2,897,924 from the sale of pre-funded warrants,
and we received net proceeds of 3,056,984, net of offering costs paid to the placement agent of 382,500 and legal fees of 60,000, which
were netted against the 601,560 of gross proceeds from the sale of common stock units for net proceeds allocated to the sale of common
stock units of 159,060. We are using the net proceeds received from the March 2024 Private Placement for general corporate purposes and
working capital. 

On September 20, 2024, we entered into an inducement
offer agreement with the Holder of the March 2024 Common Warrants to immediately exercise for cash an aggregate 1,256,734 of the March
2024 Common Warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at a reduced exercise price of 2.58 per share for gross proceeds
to the Company of 3,242,374 and we received net proceeds of 2,834,843 after deducting placement agent fees of 376,552 and other
offering expenses paid by the Company of 30,979. The exercised March 2024 Common Warrants were issued pursuant to a March 2024 Purchase
Agreement dated March 13, 2024 by and between the Company and the Holder. Each March 2024 Common Warrant was initially exercisable at
an original exercise price of 5.50 per share. 

Until such time that the Company implements its
growth strategy, we expect to continue to generate operating losses in the foreseeable future, mostly due to corporate overhead, research
and development, and costs of being a public company. We believe that our existing working capital and cash on hand will provide sufficient
cash to enable the Company to meet its operating needs and debt requirements for the next twelve months from the issuance date of this
report.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
net cash used in operations was 2,512,166, which primarily resulted from our net loss of 2,585,793, adjusted for the add back of amortization
expense of 37,036, stock-based compensation to employees of 84,190, and a realized gain on short-term investments of 121,765, and changes

asset and liabilities such as an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 79,319, a decrease in accounts payable of 65,967,
and an increase in accrued expenses of 10,966.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
net cash provided by investing activities was 842,604, which resulted from proceeds received from the sale of short-term investments
of 3,312,205, offset by cash used for the purchase of short-term investments of 2,096,293, the purchase of equity securities of 199,998,
an increase in capitalized internal-use software development costs of 23,310, and the purchase of an intangible asset of 150,000. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
net cash used in investing activities was 3,515,867, which resulted from the purchase of short-term investments of 3,491,242 and an
increase in capitalized software development costs of 24,625. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, there was no net cash used
in investing activities. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
net cash provided by financing activities was 5,872,746. On March 13, 2024, we entered into the March 2024 Private Placement of aggregate
Units consisting of (i) 108,000 shares of the Company s common stock, (ii) the March 2024 Common Warrants. The purchase price of
each Unit consisted of one share of the Company s common stock and associated March 2024 Common Warrants, was 5.57 per Unit for
aggregate gross proceeds of 601,560. Additionally, we sold pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 520,367 shares of the Company s
common stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants ). Pre-funded Warrants are a type of warrant that allows the warrant holder to purchase
a specified number of a company s securities at a nominal exercise price. The purchase price of each Pre-Funded Warrant was 5.569
for aggregate gross proceeds of 2,897,924. In connection with this March 2024 Private Placement, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of
 3,499,484 consisting of 601,560 from the sales of common stock units and 2,897,924 from the sale of pre-funded warrants, and we received
net proceeds of 3,056,984, net of offering costs paid to the placement agent of 382,500 and legal fees of 60,000, which were netted
against the 601,560 of gross proceeds from the sale of common stock units for net proceeds allocated to the sale of common stock units
of 159,060. Additionally, on September 20, 2024, we entered into an inducement offer agreement with the Holder of the March 2024 Common
Warrants to immediately exercise for cash an aggregate 1,256,734 of the March 2024 Common Warrants to purchase shares of the Company s
common stock at a reduced exercise price of 2.58 per share for gross proceeds to the Company of 3,242,374 and the Company received
net proceeds of 2,834,843 after deducting placement agent fees of 376,552 and other offering expenses paid by the Company of 30,979.
Furthermore, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased and cancelled 6,846 treasury shares for 19,602, or at an average
price of 2.86 per share. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
net cash provided by financing activities was 5,908,760. On February 17, 2023, we closed an IPO pursuant to which we issued 1,686,755
of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 7 million and net proceeds of 5,958,470, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions, and offering expenses. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we purchased and cancelled 105,931
treasury shares for 49,710, or at an average price of 0.469 per share. 

Our ultimate success is dependent on our ability
to obtain additional financing and generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis. We will require significant
amounts of capital to sustain operations, and we will need to make the investments we need to execute our longer-term business plan to
support new technologies and help advance innovation. Absent generation of sufficient revenue from the execution of our long-term business
plan, we will need to obtain debt or equity financing, especially if we experience downturns in our business that are more severe or longer
than anticipated, or if we experience significant increases in expense levels resulting from being a publicly-traded company or from operations.
Such additional debt or equity financing may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. We plan to pursue our plans with respect
to the research and development of our products which will require resources beyond those that we currently have, ultimately requiring
additional capital from third party sources. However, we believe the net proceeds received in the IPO that closed in February 2023 will
be sufficient to meet our financial obligations for at least the next 12 months.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet
Effective or Adopted 

Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

JOBS Act 

On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section
107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We have chosen to take advantage of the extended
transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards until
those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not
be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

Subject to certain conditions set forth in the
JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation,
(i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b)
of Sarbanes-Oxley and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding
mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the
financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company until the
earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last
day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued
more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated
filer under the rules of the SEC. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are not required to provide the information
required by this Item as we are a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in
reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that
the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute
assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may be subject to litigation
and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not
aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, cash flows or financial condition. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risk factors that affect our business and financial
results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023 as filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024 Annual Report ). There have been no material changes in our risk factors from
those previously disclosed in our Annual Report, except discussed below. You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual
Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are
not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also
may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business,
financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

None. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 

During the fiscal quarter ended September 30,
2024, none of the Company s directors or executive officers or any contract, instruction
or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule
10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.
