Stock compensation expense recorded for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 totaled million and million, respectively. Stock compensation expense recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled million and million, respectively. 
 Phantom Plan: During the first quarter of 2024, the Company adopted the Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation 2024 Phantom Stock Plan ("Phantom Plan"). The Phantom Plan allows the Company to issue performance-based and service-based awards which will be paid in cash. The award of a phantom unit entitles the participant to a cash payment equal to the value of the unit on the vesting date, which is the fair market value of a common share of the Company's stock on such vesting date. The Company issued performance-based and service-based phantom units in 2024. Service-based phantom units vest ratably over a period. There were service-based phantom units granted under the Phantom Plan during the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, there are restricted stock units that will settle in cash in 2025 and 2026. The performance-based phantom units are dependent upon the Company meeting certain performance criteria and, to the extent the performance criteria are met, will cliff vest at the end of the performance period, which is three years. There were performance-based units granted under the Phantom Plan in the first nine months of 2024. Phantom units are recorded in salary and employee benefits expense based on the fair value of the units on the balance sheet date. The fair value of these awards is updated at each balance sheet date and changes in the fair value of the vested portions of the awards are recorded as increases or decreases to compensation expense within salary and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All of the outstanding phantom units at September 30, 2024 met the criteria to be treated under liability classification in accordance with ASC 718, given that these awards will settle in cash on the vesting date. Compensation expense for the phantom units is based on the fair value of the units as of the balance sheet date as further discussed above, and such costs are recognized ratably over the service period of the awards. As the fair value of liability awards is required to be re-measured each period end, stock compensation expense amounts recognized in future periods for these awards will vary. The estimated future cash payments of these awards are presented as liabilities within "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" in the Consolidated Statement of Condition. As of September 30, 2024, there was million of unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested phantom units. shares. The ESPP allows for the purchase of shares during four three-month Offering Periods of each calendar year. The Offering Periods end on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each calendar year. Each participant in the Offering Period is granted an option to purchase a number of shares and may contribute between percent and percent of their compensation. At the end of each Offering Period, the number of shares to be purchased by the employee is determined by dividing the employee s contributions accumulated during the Offering Period by the applicable purchase price. The purchase price is an amount equal to percent of the closing market price of a share of common stock on the purchase date. Participation in the ESPP is voluntary and employees can cancel their purchases at any time during the period without penalty. The fair value of each share purchase right is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recorded and in salaries and employee benefits expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the ESPP.

Available for sale and held to maturity securities are evaluated to determine if a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. An impairment related to credit factors would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited to the amount by which the security s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. An impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Investment securities will be written down to fair value through the Consolidated Statements of Income when management intends to sell, or may be required to sell, the securities before they recover in value. The issuers of securities currently in a continuous loss position continue to make timely principal and interest payments and none of these securities were past due or were placed in nonaccrual status at September 30, 2024. Substantially all of the investment securities are backed by loans guaranteed by either U.S. government agencies or U.S government-sponsored entities, and Management believes that default is highly unlikely given the lack of historical credit losses and governmental backing. Management believes that the unrealized losses on these securities are a function of changes in market interest rates and credit spreads, not changes in credit quality. Therefore, no allowance for credit losses was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, respectively. The Company has an investment in a CRA investment fund with a fair value of million at September 30, 2024. This investment is classified as an equity security in our Consolidated Statements of Condition. This security had a gain of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This amount was included in the fair value adjustment for CRA equity security on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

There were several loan modifications made during the first nine months of 2024, which included investment commercial real estate loan, commercial loan and equipment finance of million, million and million, respectively, that were completed during the third quarter of 2024. Loans past due 30 through 89 days at September 30, 2024 included million of multifamily loans to two sponsors. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 these loans have been placed on nonaccrual status and downgraded to substandard. 
 Credit Quality Indicators: The Company places all commercial loans into various credit risk rating categories based on an assessment of the expected ability of the borrowers to properly service their debt. The assessment considers numerous factors including, but not limited to, current financial information on the borrower, historical payment experience, strength of any guarantor, nature of and value of any collateral, acceptability of the loan structure and documentation, relevant public information and current economic trends. This credit risk rating analysis is performed when the loan is initially underwritten and then annually based on set criteria in the loan policy. In addition, the Bank has engaged an independent loan review firm to validate risk ratings and to ensure compliance with our policies and procedures. This review of the following types of loans is performed quarterly: A large sample of relationships or new lending to existing relationships greater than booked since the prior review; 

 All criticized and classified rated borrowers with relationship exposure of more than ; 

21 

and a small sample of Pass related relationships less than ; 

 All leveraged loans of or greater; 

 At least two borrowing relationships managed by each commercial banker; 

 Any new Federal Reserve Board Regulation O loan commitments over ; and 

 Any other credits requested by Bank senior management or a member of the Board of Directors and any borrower for which the reviewer determines a review is warranted based upon knowledge of the portfolio, local events, industry stresses, etc. 

 The review excludes borrowers with commitments of less than . The Company uses the following regulatory definitions for criticized and classified risk ratings: Special Mention: These loans have a potential weakness that deserves Management s close attention. If left uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loans or of the institution s credit position at some future date. Substandard: These loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful: These loans have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above-described process are considered to be pass-rated loans. With the adoption of CECL, loans that are in the process of or expected to be in foreclosure are deemed to be collateral dependent with respect to measuring potential loss and allowance adequacy and are individually evaluated by Management. Loans that do not share common risk characteristics are also evaluated on an individual basis. All other loans are evaluated using a non-linear discounted cash flow methodology for measuring potential loss and allowance adequacy.

At September 30, 2024, million of substandard loans were individually evaluated, compared to million at December 31, 2023. The increase in individually evaluated substandard loans was primarily due to multifamily loans with a balance of million that were graded as substandard during the nine months of 2024, offset by the sale of multifamily individually evaluated loans totaling million. Loan Modifications: On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2022-02, which replaced the accounting and recognition of troubled debt restructurings. The Company will provide modifications, which may include other than insignificant delays in payment of amounts due, extension of the terms of the notes or reduction in the interest rates on the notes. In certain instances, the Company may grant more than one type of modification. All accruing modified loans were paying in accordance with their modified terms as of September 30, 2024. The Company has not committed to lend additional amounts as of September 30, 2024 to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as modified loans.

Individually evaluated loans include nonaccrual loans of million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. Individually evaluated loans did t include any performing modified loans at September 30, 2024. An allowance of was allocated to modified loans at September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses was million as of September 30, 2024, compared to million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses ACL was primarily related to an increase in the ACL related to multifamily loans, which was driven by the increase in individually evaluated loans of million to million and certain qualitative adjustments made during the first nine months of 2024. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans was percent at September 30, 2024, compared to percent at December 31, 2023. Under Topic 326, the Company's methodology for determining the ACL on loans is based upon key assumptions, including historic net charge-offs, economic forecasts, reversion periods, prepayments and qualitative adjustments. The allowance is measured on a collective, or pool, basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share common risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are excluded from the collective evaluation.

percent should be applied to appraisals on properties. The discount is determined based on the nature of the underlying properties, aging of appraisals and other factors. For each collateral-dependent impaired loan, we consider other factors, such as certain indices or other market information, as well as property specific circumstances to determine if an adjustment to the appraised value is needed. In situations where there is evidence of change in value, the Bank will determine if there is a need for an adjustment to the specific reserve on the collateral dependent impaired loans. When the Bank applies an interim adjustment, it generally shows the adjustment as an incremental specific reserve against the loan until it has received the full updated appraisal. All collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned valuations were supported by an appraisal less than months old or in the process of obtaining an appraisal as of September 30, 2024.

A description of the Company s revenue streams accounted for under ASC 606 follows: Service charges on deposit accounts : The Company earns fees from its deposit customers for certain transaction account maintenance, and overdraft fees. Transaction-based fees, which include services such as ATM use fees, stop payment charges, statement rendering, and ACH fees, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point in time the Company fulfills the customer s request.

million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were designated as cash flow hedges of certain interest-bearing deposits. On a quarterly basis, the Company performs a qualitative hedge effectiveness assessment. This assessment takes into consideration any adverse developments related to the counterparty s risk of default and any negative events or circumstances that affect the factors that originally enabled the Company to assess that it could reasonably support, qualitatively, an expectation that the hedging relationship was and will continue to be highly effective. As of September 30, 2024, there were no events or market conditions that would result in hedge ineffectiveness. The aggregate fair value of the swaps is recorded in other assets/liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income would be reclassified to current earnings should the hedges no longer be considered effective. The Company expects the hedges to remain fully effective during the remaining terms of the swaps.

The amount exchanged is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the individual contracts. The fair value of the swaps is recorded as both an asset and a liability, in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in equal amounts for these transactions. The accrued interest receivable and payable related to these swaps of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is recorded in other assets and other liabilities.

Except as may be required by applicable law or regulation, the Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements to conform the statement to actual results or change in the Company s expectations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
 48 

with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 1 to the Company s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a summary of the Company s significant accounting policies. 
 The Company s determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires Management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in the methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses or in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations. This critical policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. 
 On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326), which replaced the incurred loss methodology with CECL for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other commitments to extend credit. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for Management s estimate of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The process to determine expected credit losses utilizes analytic tools and Management judgment and is reviewed on a quarterly basis. When Management is reasonably certain that a loan balance is not fully collectable, an analysis is completed whereby a specific reserve may be established or a full or partial charge off is recorded against the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance via a quantitative analysis which considers available information from internal and external sources related to past loan loss and prepayment experience and current economic conditions, as well as the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts. Management evaluates a variety of factors including available published economic information in arriving at its forecast. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. Also included in the allowance for credit losses are qualitative reserves that are expected, but, in the Management s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative analysis or the forecasts described above. Factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, size and composition of the portfolio, experience and depth of Management and the effect of external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory requirements, among others. The allowance is available for any loan that, in Management s judgment, should be charged off. 
 Although Management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for credit losses remains an estimate, which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require the Company to make additional provisions for credit losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination. Furthermore, the majority of the Company s loans are secured by real estate in New Jersey and, to a lesser extent, New York City. Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the Company s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and any adverse economic conditions. Future adjustments to the provision for credit losses and the allowance for credit losses may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory and other conditions beyond the Company s control. 
 The Company accounts for its debt securities in accordance with ASC 320, Investments - Debt Securities and its equity security in accordance with ASC 321, Investments Equity Securities. All securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax. Securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. The Company s investment in a CRA investment fund is classified as an equity security. In accordance with ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments unrealized holding gains and losses for equity securities are marked to market through the income statement.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded total revenue of 56.6 million, pretax income of 10.7 million, net income of 7.6 million and diluted earnings per share of 0.43, compared to revenue of 55.9 million, pretax income of 12.6 million, net income of 8.8 million and diluted earnings per share of 0.49 for the same period last year. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded total revenue of 166.3 million, pretax income of 32.7 million, net income of 23.7 million and diluted earnings per share of 1.34, compared to revenue of 175.4 million, pretax income of 55.7 million, net income of 40.3 million and diluted earnings per share of 2.23 for the same period last year. 
 
 During 2024, the Company expanded into the metro New York market, leading with our "Single Point of Contact" private banking strategy, which continues to demonstrate progress and positive momentum. Increasing deposits through the growth of core deposit relationships has enabled us to repay all short-term borrowings, which enhances our liquidity position and improves net interest margin. 
 
 The decrease in net income for both the three and nine month 2024 periods when compared to the same 2023 periods was principally driven by increased operating expenses, which was principally attributable to the Company's expansion into New York City and expanding our unique private banking model that offers a single point of contact for all banking services. The decrease in net income for the nine month 2024 period when compared to the same 2023 period was also driven by the Company's decreased net interest income due to net interest margin contraction, as a result of higher deposit and borrowings rates. The Company has seen positive momentum in net interest margin during the second and third quarters of 2024, as a result of paying down overnight borrowings with core deposit growth at a lower cost. During 2024, deposits grew 661.3 million, which included 122.2 million in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Other income and wealth management fee income continue to be a consistent and steady revenue stream for the Company. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS: For a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements, see the information set forth in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations. 
 EARNINGS ANALYSIS 
 NET INTEREST INCOME NII / NET INTEREST MARGIN NIM / AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET: 
 The primary source of the Company s operating income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividends earned on interest-earning assets and fees earned on loans, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Earning assets include loans, investment securities, interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing checking, savings and time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, subordinated debt and other borrowings. Net interest income is determined by the difference between the average yields earned on earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities net interest spread and the relative amounts of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is net interest income as a percent of total interest-earning assets on an annualized basis. The Company s net interest income, spread and margin are affected by regulatory, economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand and deposit flows and general levels of nonperforming assets.

Net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, increased 1.0 million, or 3 percent, for the third quarter of 2024 to 37.9 million from 36.9 million for the same 2023 period. The net interest margin ("NIM") was 2.34 percent and 2.28 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 6 basis points. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, of 107.9 million compared to 120.6 million for the same 2023 period. The NIM was 2.26 percent and 2.54 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 28 basis points. Net interest income, on a fully tax- equivalent basis, and NIM expanded during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, due to the Bank's focus on growing client deposit relationships, which were used to pay down higher cost overnight borrowings. The decrease in net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, and NIM for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same 2023 period, was predominately due to a rapid increase in interest expense mostly 
 55 

driven by higher deposit rates, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds and an increase in loan yields. The Federal Reserve monetary policy intended to slow inflation has led to a significant increase in interest rates, particularly rates impacting short term investments and deposits. This has resulted in an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve driving an increase in deposit and borrowing costs at a faster rate than the yields on interest-earning assets . The Federal Reserve decreased the target Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points at the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting though the impact of these rate cuts had minimal impact on results for the three month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The average balance of interest-earning assets increased slightly to 6.45 billion during the third quarter of 2024 from 6.43 billion for the same 2023 period, reflecting an increase of 19.3 million. Average interest-earning assets were 6.37 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.34 billion in the same 2023 period, representing an increase of 27.9 million. The increase in average interest-earning assets included an increase in the average balance of interest-earning deposits of 190.4 million and 78.0 million, respectively, as well as an increase in average investments of 57.8 million and 17.4 million, respectively, for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same 2023 periods. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the average balance of loans for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 228.9 million and 67.6 million, respectively, when compared to the same 2023 periods . 
 
 The decline in the average balance of loans for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decline in commercial mortgages and commercial loans, offset slightly by growth in installment loans. The average balance of commercial loans declined by 139.1 million, or 6 percent, to 2.16 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 when compared to 2.30 billion for the same 2023 period. The average balance of commercial mortgages for the three months ended September 30, 2024 declined by 120.6 million, or 5 percent, to 2.38 billion when compared to the same 2023 period. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the average balance of installment loans of 17.2 million to 73.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same 2023 period. The average balance of loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased due to declines in commercial mortgages and commercial loans partially offset by growth in installment loans and residential mortgages. The average balance of commercial loans declined by 50.9 million to 2.20 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same 2023 period. The average balance of commercial mortgages for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 declined by 74.4 million to 2.42 billion when compared to the same 2023 period. Residential mortgages increased by 22.0 million to 578.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 556.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of installment loans increased by 19.4 million to 68.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 49.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decline in the average balance of loans for both the three- and nine-month periods were mostly a result of the Company tightening underwriting guidelines, pay downs of higher rate lines of credit and lower originations due to the higher interest rate environment. 
 For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average yields earned on interest-earning assets were 5.18 percent and 4.91 percent, respectively, an increase of 27 basis points. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average yield on interest-earning assets were 5.08 percent and 4.73 percent, respectively, an increase of 35 basis points. The increase in yields on interest-earning assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the increase in the target Federal Funds rate of 100 basis points during 2023 (525 basis points since the Federal Reserve commenced raising rates in March 2022). This resulted in increases for the three-month periods of 31 basis points on loans to 5.58 percent, of 59 basis points on interest-earning deposits to 4.88 percent and of 26 basis points on investments to 2.82 percent, when comparing the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to the same 2023 period. Increases in the average yields for the nine-month periods were 36 basis points on loans to 5.46 percent, 65 basis points on interest-earning deposits to 4.69 percent and 25 basis points on investments to 2.67 percent. 
 The average yield on total loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same 2023 periods was driven by an increase in the yield on commercial loans, commercial mortgages and residential mortgages. The yield on commercial loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 46 basis points to 6.96 percent from 6.50 percent at September 30, 2023. The yield on commercial loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 51 basis points to 6.81 percent from 6.30 percent for the same period in 2023. The average yield on commercial loans increased for both the three- and nine-month periods due to an increase in the target Federal Funds rate, which had a greater impact on these loans, that are typically floating rates with short repricing periods. The average yield on commercial mortgages increased 16 basis points to 4.60 percent and 20 basis points to 4.50 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same 2023 periods. The average yield on residential mortgages increased 43 basis points to 4.02 percent and 42 basis points to 3.88 percent, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same 2023 periods. The increase for both commercial and residential mortgages for the three- and nine-month periods were driven by the origination of loans with higher yields in the current higher interest rate environment. As of September 30, 2024, 30 percent of our loans will reprice within one month, 35 percent within three months and 49 percent within one year. 
 56 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities totaled 4.82 billion representing a decrease of 22.3 million from 4.84 billion for the same 2023 period due a decrease in overnight borrowings of 470.6 million to no overnight borrowings at September 30, 2024. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest-bearing deposits of 450.5 million to 4.68 billion at September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities totaled 4.80 billion representing an increase of 114.9 million from 4.68 billion for the same 2023 period due to an increase in interest-bearing deposits of 360.3 million to 4.58 billion partially offset by a decrease in overnight borrowings of 243.9 million to 87.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 comparable period was primarily due to an increase in the average balances of interest-bearing checking deposits of 401.1 million, retail certificate of deposits ("CD") of 97.1 million and money market accounts of 61.5 million . The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 comparable period was primarily due to increases in the average balances of interest-bearing checking deposits of 349.1 million, retail CDs of 111.9 million and short-term brokered CDs of 26.1 million, partially offset by declines in the average balance of money market and savings accounts of 121.5 million. The increase in interest-bearing checking deposits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally attributable to client demand for FDIC insured products. The Company added short-term brokered CDs to provide additional liquidity and replace brokered deposit run-off. The decrease for the savings and money market accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included clients shifting balances into higher-yielding short-term Treasuries and interest-bearing checking accounts. The expansion into New York City is starting to benefit deposit growth and has reduced the Company's reliance on overnight borrowings, brokered deposits and other high cost funding sources while shifting funding into lower cost, relationship deposits. 
 The Company is a participant in the Reich Tang Demand Deposit Marketplace program and the Promontory Program. The Company uses these deposit sweep services to place customer funds into interest-bearing demand (checking) accounts issued by other participating banks. Customer funds are placed at one or more participating banks to increase the level of FDIC insurance available to deposit customers. As a participant, the Company receives reciprocal amounts of deposits from other participating banks. Average reciprocal deposit balances for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 1.32 billion and 982.9 million, respectively. Average reciprocal deposit balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 1.20 billion and 809.4 million, respectively. The additional growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was directly related to clients' desire for the increased level of FDIC insurance offered by these programs. 
 At September 30, 2024, uninsured/unprotected deposits were approximately 1.4 billion, or 24 percent of total deposits. This amount was adjusted to exclude 354 million of public fund deposit balances, which are fully-collateralized and protected with securities and an FHLBNY letter of credit. 
 The Company did not have any short-term borrowings during the third quarter of 2024 compared to 470.6 million for the same 2023 period. The average balance of borrowings decreased 243.9 million to 87.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 331.2 million for the same 2023 period. The decrease in borrowings for both periods was driven by the growth in client deposits led by the Company s expansion into New York City, which were used to pay down borrowings. 
 For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 3.78 percent and 3.47 percent, respectively, reflecting an increase of 31 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 3.74 percent and 2.97 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were driven by an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits of 56 basis points to 3.74 percent for the third quarter of 2024 and 94 basis points to 3.66 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company benefitted from no short-term borrowing costs in the third quarter of 2024 compared to an average cost of 5.58 percent for the same 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average cost of borrowings increased 55 basis points to 5.88 percent from 5.33 percent for the same 2023 period. The increase in deposit and borrowing rates was due to the Federal Reserve raising the target Federal Funds rate by 525 basis points since March 2022 and a change in the composition of the deposit portfolio, as clients continue to migrate into higher-yielding alternatives. 
 
 INVESTMENT SECURITIES: Investment securities available for sale are purchased, sold and/or maintained as a part of the Company s overall balance sheet and interest rate risk management strategies, and in response to liquidity needs, prepayment speeds and/or other factors. These securities are carried at estimated fair value, and unrealized changes in fair value are recognized as a separate component of shareholders equity, net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses are recognized in income at the time the securities are sold. Investment securities held to maturity are those securities that the Company has both the ability and intent to hold to maturity. These securities are carried at amortized cost. Equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest income. 
 57 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had investment securities available for sale with a fair value of 682.7 million compared with 550.6 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in investment securities available for sale was due to the use of excess funds for security purchases as deposit growth outpaced loan growth during the first nine months of 2024. A net unrealized loss (net of income tax) of 57.6 million and of 69.2 million related to these securities were included in shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had investment securities held to maturity with a carrying cost of 103.2 million and an estimated fair value of 92.4 million compared with a carrying cost of 107.8 million and an estimated fair value of 94.4 million at December 31, 2023.

The Company recorded total other income, excluding wealth management fee income, of 3.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.4 million for the same 2023 period, reflecting a decrease of 1.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded total other income, excluding wealth management fee income, of 13.2 million and 
 59 

14.0 million, respectively, reflecting a decrease of 781,000. The decreases were primarily due to income associated with equipment transfers upon the termination of leases, which declined 2.1 million to 225,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.3 million for the same 2023 period and declined 727,000 to 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.7 million for the same 2023 period. 
 The Company provides loans that are partially guaranteed by the SBA to provide working capital and/or finance the purchase of equipment, inventory or commercial real estate that could be used for start-up businesses. All SBA loans are underwritten and documented as prescribed by the SBA. The Company generally sells the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans in the secondary market, with the non-guaranteed portion of SBA loans held in the loan portfolio. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of SBA loans of 365,000 and 491,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a gain on the sale of SBA loans of 1.2 million and 2.2 million, respectively. The Company continues to see pressure from market volatility and the higher interest rate environment resulting in lower sale premiums and origination volumes. 
 The Company recorded corporate advisory fee income for the third quarter of 2024 of 55,000 compared to 85,000 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 976,000 of corporate advisory fee income compared to 180,000 for the same 2023 period. The higher amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to a corporate advisory/investment banking acquisition transaction completed in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Income from the back-to-back swap, SBA programs, and corporate advisory fee income are dependent on volume, and thus are typically not consistent from quarter to quarter. 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, income from the sale of newly originated residential mortgage loans was 15,000 compared to 37,000 for the same period in 2023. The Company recorded income from the sale of newly originated residential mortgage loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 105,000 and 73,000, respectively. The Company continues to be impacted by the industry wide slowdown in refinancing and home purchase activity in the higher interest rate environment. 
 
 Other income included 225,000 of income by the Equipment Finance Division related to equipment transfers to lessees upon the termination of leases for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.3 million for the same 2023 period. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included 1.9 million and 2.7 million, respectively, of income related to equipment transfers to lessees upon the termination of leases. Additionally, the Company recorded 845,000 of unused commercial line fees for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 794,000 for the same 2023 period. Unused line fees were 2.5 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 55,000 and 236,000, respectively, of additional income from life insurance proceeds. 
 
 The Company recorded a 474,000 of positive fair value adjustment and 404,000 negative fair value adjustment for CRA equity securities in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a 279,000 positive fair value adjustment for CRA equity securities, compared to a 404,000 negative fair value adjustment for the same 2023 period. The increase in 2024 was predominantly due to the underlying assets being tied to medium-term investments and the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates in September 2024.

Operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 44.6 million and 37.4 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of 7.2 million, or 19 percent. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 17.1 million, or 15 percent, to 127.8 million from 110.7 million for the same 2023 period. The increase in operating expenses for both 2024 periods, when compared to the same prior year periods, was principally attributable to the Company's expansion into New York City, which included the hiring of multiple teams and expenses related to the opening of office and retail space in our Park Avenue location in New York City. The 2024 periods included additional expense associated with annual merit increases and increased employee benefits, increased credit costs, as well as increased office space, computer and software equipment costs related to the New York City expansion. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 2.0 million of expense associated with retirements of certain employees and 175,000 of expenses associated with the closure of three retail branch locations.

 The market value of the assets under management and/or administration AUM/AUA of Peapack Private was 12.1 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting a 11 percent increase from 10.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and an increase of 16 percent from 10.4 billion at September 30, 2023. The equity market improved during the first nine months of 2024 and coupled with gross business inflows of 547 million, contributed to the increase in AUM/AUA. 
 
 In the September 2024 quarter, Peapack Private generated 15.2 million in fee income compared to 14.0 million for the September 2023 quarter, reflecting an 8 percent increase. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Peapack Private generated 46.0 million in fee income compared to 42.0 million in fee income for the same period in 2023, reflecting a 10 percent increase. The increase in fee income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was largely due to the improved equity and bond markets during the first nine months of 2024 and new business inflows. 
 Operating expenses relative to Peapack Private, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased slightly to 10.0 million as compared to 9.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses relative to Peapack Private, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, declined to 30.1 million as compared to 30.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Expenses are in line with the Company s Strategic Plan, particularly the hiring of key management and revenue-producing personnel. 
 Peapack Private currently generates adequate revenue to support the salaries, benefits and other expenses of the wealth division and Management believes it will continue to do so as the Company grows organically and/or by acquisition. Management believes that the Bank generates adequate liquidity to support the expenses of Peapack Private should it be necessary.

(C) Nonperforming loans/assets do not include performing modifications. 

The Company had increases in nonperforming assets, performing modifications, loans subject to special mention, classified loans and individually evaluated loans at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The persistent nature of the elevated interest rate environment combined with inflationary pressures have presented challenges for certain borrowers, which is reflected in the trend of asset quality data in recent quarters. The increase in nonperforming assets since the beginning of 2024 was primarily driven by six multifamily loan relationships that have been classified as nonperforming loans during the current year. The increase in special mention loans was primarily due to an increase in multifamily loans of 51.1 million. There were several loan modifications made during the first nine months of 2024, which included one investment commercial real estate loan, one commercial loan and one equipment finance of 17.3 million, 11.7 million and 10.5 million, respectively, that were completed during the third quarter of 2024. Loans past due 30 through 89 days at September 30, 2024 included 19.7 million of multifamily loans to two sponsors. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 these loans have been placed on nonaccrual status and downgraded to substandard. The increase in classified loans was primarily driven by an increase in multifamily loans of 16.5 million, investment commercial real estate of 17.2 million and commercial loans of 27.6 million when compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in the balance of individually evaluated substandard loans was primarily due to six multifamily relationships totaling 31.8 million that transferred to nonaccrual status during the first nine months of 2024 which was partially offset by the sale of two multifamily individually evaluated loans totaling 15.1 million. 
 
 PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES : The provision for credit losses was 1.2 million and 5.9 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the provision for loan losses was 5.8 million and 9.1 million, respectively. The decreased provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by overall slower loan growth and a recovery of approximately 2.1 million, partially offset by additional specific reserves related to certain isolated credits of 1.8 million. The higher provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2023 was due principally to a specific reserve of 4.5 million for a freight-related credit that was transferred to nonaccrual. The allowance for credit losses ACL was 71.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 65.9 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the ACL was primarily related to an increase in the ACL related to multifamily loans, which was driven by the increase in individually evaluated loans of 16.7 million and certain qualitative adjustments in the CECL calculation made during the first nine months of 2024. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans was 1.34 percent at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.21 percent at December 31, 2023. The ACL recorded on individually evaluated loans was 9.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 4.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Total individually 
 62 

evaluated loans were 80.0 million and 60.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The general component of the allowance increased from 61.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 61.6 million at September 30, 2024. 
 On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326), which replaced the incurred loss methodology with CECL for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other commitments to extend credit. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance of Management s estimate of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The process to determine expected credit losses utilizes analytic tools and Management judgment and is reviewed on a quarterly basis. When Management is reasonably certain that a loan balance is not fully collectable, an analysis is completed whereby a specific reserve may be established or a full or partial charge off is recorded against the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance via a quantitative analysis which considers available information from internal and external sources related to past loan loss and prepayment experience and current economic conditions, as well as the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts. Management evaluates a variety of factors including available published economic information in arriving at its forecast. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. Also included in the allowance for credit losses are qualitative reserves that are expected, but, in the Management s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative analysis or the forecasts described above. Factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, size and composition of the portfolio, experience and depth of management and the effect of external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory requirements, among others. The allowance is available for any loan that, in Management s judgment, should be charged off.

The decrease in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was primarily due to the increase in nonperforming loans of 9.6 million to 80.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 70.8 million at September 30, 2023. 
 
 INCOME TAXES: Income tax expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 3.2 million as compared to 3.8 million for the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of 9.0 million compared to 15.4 million for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 29.40 percent compared to 30.52 percent for the same quarter in 2023. The effective tax rate was 27.41 percent and 27.67 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The nine months ended September 30, 2024 periods included a benefit related to the Company's deferred tax asset associated with a surtax imposed by the State of New Jersey. This benefit was partially offset by adjustments related to the vesting of restricted stock at prices lower than original grant prices in 2024, while 2023 benefited from the vesting of restricted stock at prices higher than original grant prices .

CAPITAL RESOURCES: A solid capital base provides the Company with financial strength and the ability to support future growth and is essential to executing the Company s current Strategic Plan. The Company s capital strategy is intended to provide stability to expand its business, even in stressed environments. Quarterly stress testing is integral to the Company s capital management process. 
 
 The Company strives to maintain capital levels in excess of internal triggers and in excess of those considered to be well capitalized under regulatory guidelines applicable to banks and bank holding companies. Maintaining an adequate capital position supports the Company s goal of providing shareholders an attractive and stable long-term return on investment. 
 
 Capital increased as a result of net income of 23.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, during the nine months of 2024, the Company recorded a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 10.1 million, net of tax. The total accumulated other comprehensive loss declined to 54.8 million as of September 30, 2024, 57.6 million loss related to the available for sale securities portfolio partially offset by a 2.8 million gain on the cash flow hedges). This was partially offset by the repurchase of 300,000 shares, at an average price of 23.96 through the Company's stock repurchase program at a total cost of 7.2 million and payment of dividends of 2.7 million. 
 
 The Company employs quarterly capital stress testing by modeling adverse case and severely adverse case scenarios. In the most recent completed stress test based on June 30, 2024 financial information, under the severely adverse case, and no growth scenarios, the Bank remains well capitalized over a two-year stress period. 
 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total, Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital (each as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the Bank s capital ratios remain above the levels required to be considered well capitalized and the Company s capital ratios remain above regulatory requirements. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, common equity Tier I and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. 
 
 As a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a Community Bank Leverage Ratio ("CBLR") (the ratio of a bank s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. A qualifying community bank that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered well capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking agencies set the minimum capital for the CBLR at 9 percent. The Bank did not opt into the CBLR and will continue to comply with the requirements under Basel III. The Bank s leverage ratio was 10.99 percent at September 30, 2024.

(A) The Basel Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain a 2.5 capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of (i) Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets or (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets above the respective minimum but below the capital conservation buffer face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. 

The Dividend Reinvestment Plan of Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation, or the Reinvestment Plan, allows shareholders of the Company to purchase additional shares of common stock using cash dividends without payment of any brokerage commissions or other charges. Shareholders may also make voluntary cash payments of up to 200,000 per quarter to purchase additional shares of common stock. Voluntary share purchases in the Reinvestment Plan can be filled from the Company s authorized but unissued shares and/or in the open market, at the discretion of the Company. All shares purchased during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were purchased in the open market. 
 On September 25, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of 0.05 per share payable on November 22, 2024 to shareholders of record on November 7, 2024. 
 Management believes the Company s capital position and capital ratios are adequate. Further, Management believes the Company has sufficient common equity to support its planned growth for the immediate future. The Company continually assesses other potential sources of capital to support future growth. 
 LIQUIDITY: Liquidity refers to an institution s ability to meet short-term requirements including funding of loans, deposit withdrawals and maturing obligations, as well as long-term obligations, including potential capital expenditures. The Company s liquidity risk management is intended to ensure the Company has adequate funding and liquidity to support its assets across a range of market environments and conditions, including stressed conditions. Principal sources of liquidity include cash, temporary 
 66 

investments, securities available for sale, customer deposit inflows, loan repayments and secured borrowings. Other liquidity sources include loan sales, loan participations and brokered CDs. 
 Management actively monitors and manages the Company s liquidity position and believes it is sufficient to meet future needs. Cash and cash equivalents, including interest-earning deposits, totaled 492.7 million at September 30, 2024. The Company's elevated liquidity position was due to deposit growth of 661.3 million and loan contraction of 113.9 million during the first nine months of 2024. In addition, the Company had 682.7 million in securities designated as available for sale at September 30, 2024. These securities can be sold, or used as collateral for borrowings, in response to liquidity concerns. Available for sale and held to maturity securities with a carrying value of 590.8 million and 101.1 million as of September 30, 2024, respectively, were pledged to secure public funds and for other purposes required or permitted by law. In addition, the Company generates significant liquidity from scheduled and unscheduled principal repayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 3.0 billion of external borrowing capacity available on a same day basis (subject to any practical constraints affecting the FHLB or FRB), which when combined with balance sheet liquidity provided the Company with 293 percent coverage of our uninsured/unprotected deposits. 
 Brokered interest-bearing demand overnight deposits were 10.0 million at September 30, 2024. The interest rate paid on these deposits allows the Bank to fund operations at attractive rates and engage in interest rate swaps to hedge its asset-liability interest rate risk. The Company ensures ample available collateralized liquidity as a backup to these short-term brokered deposits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had transacted pay fixed, receive floating interest rate swaps totaling 360.0 million in notional amount. 
 The Company allowed 120.5 million of brokered certificates of deposits to mature during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These deposits were replaced by lower cost core relationship deposits as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company has a Board-approved Contingency Funding Plan. This plan provides a framework for managing adverse liquidity stress and contingent sources of liquidity. The Company conducts liquidity stress testing on a regular basis to ensure sufficient liquidity in a stressed environment. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity given the current environment. 
 Management believes the Company s liquidity position and sources were adequate at September 30, 2024. 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qua litative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT : The Company s management Asset/Liability Committee ALCO is responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring asset/liability strategies and advising the Board of Directors on such strategies, as well as the related level of interest rate risk. In this regard, interest rate risk simulation models are prepared on a quarterly basis. These models demonstrate balance sheet gaps and predict changes to net interest income and the economic/market value of portfolio equity under various interest rate scenarios. In addition, these models, as well as ALCO processes and reporting, are subject to annual independent third-party review. 
 
 ALCO generally manages interest rate risk through the management of capital, cash flows and the duration of assets and liabilities, including sales and purchases of assets, as well as additions of wholesale borrowings and other sources of medium/longer-term funding. ALCO engages in interest rate swaps as a means of extending the duration of shorter-term liabilities. 
 67 

The following strategies are among those used to manage interest rate risk: 
 Actively market C I loans, which tend to have adjustable-rate features, and which generate customer relationships that can result in higher core deposit accounts; 

Actively market equipment finance leases and loans, which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than real estate loans; 

Limit residential mortgage portfolio originations to adjustable-rate and/or shorter-term and/or relationship loans that result in core deposit and/or wealth management relationships; 

Actively market core deposit relationships, which are generally longer duration liabilities; 

Utilize medium-to-longer term certificates of deposit and/or wholesale borrowings to extend liability duration; 

Utilize interest rate swaps to extend liability duration; 

Utilize a loan level / back-to-back interest rate swap program, which converts a borrower s fixed rate loan to adjustable rate for the Company; 

Closely monitor and actively manage the investment portfolio, including management of duration, prepayment and interest rate risk; 

Maintain adequate levels of capital; and 

Utilize loan sales. 

The interest rate swap program is administered by ALCO and follows procedures and documentation in accordance with regulatory guidance and standards as set forth in ASC 815 for cash flow hedges. The program incorporates pre-purchase analysis, liability designation, sensitivity analysis, correlation analysis, daily mark-to-market analysis and collateral posting as required. The Board is advised of all swap activity. In these swaps, the Company is receiving floating and paying fixed interest rates with total notional value of 360.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, the Company initiated a loan level/back-to-back swap program in support of its commercial lending business. Pursuant to this program, the Company extends a floating rate loan and executed a floating to fixed swap with the borrower. At the same time, the Company executes a third-party swap, the terms of which fully offset the fixed exposure and, result in a final floating rate exposure for the Company. As of September 30, 2024, 466.8 million of notional value in swaps were executed and outstanding with borrowers under this program. 
 As noted above, ALCO uses simulation modeling to analyze the Company s net interest income sensitivity, as well as the Company s economic value of portfolio equity under various interest rate scenarios. The models are based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The models incorporate certain prepayment and interest rate assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable as of September 30, 2024. The models assume changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the balance sheet by management. In the models, the forecasted shape of the yield curve remained static as of September 30, 2024. 
 In an immediate and sustained 100 basis point increase in market rates at September 30, 2024, net interest income would be flat in year 1 and increase by 2.2 percent in year 2, compared to a flat interest rate scenario. In an immediate and sustained 100 basis point decrease in market rates at September 30, 2024, net interest income would decrease approximately 1.2 percent for year 1 and decrease 4.1 percent for year 2, compared to a flat interest rate scenario. 
 In an immediate and sustained 200 basis point increase in market rates at September 30, 2024, net interest income would increase approximately 1.1 percent in year 1 and increase by 5.2 percent in year 2, compared to a flat interest rate scenario. In an immediate and sustained 200 basis point decrease in market rates at September 30, 2024, net interest income for year 1 would decrease approximately 3.2 percent, when compared to a flat interest rate scenario. In year 2, net interest income would decrease 9.2 percent, when compared to a flat interest rate scenario. 
 The Company's interest rate sensitivity models indicate the Company is asset sensitive as of September 30, 2024 and that net interest income would improve in a rising rate environment, but decline in a falling rate environment.

 (B) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. 
 (C) EVPE ratio represents EVPE divided by the present value of assets. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk. Simulation modeling requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the modeling assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the information provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.

ITEM 4. Contr ols and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the forms and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of a control system reflects resource constraints. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been or will be detected. These inherent limitations include that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. Leg al Proceedings 
 In the normal course of its business, lawsuits and claims may be brought against the Company and its subsidiaries. There are no currently pending or threatened litigation or proceedings against the Company or its subsidiaries, which if adversely decided, we believe would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 ITEM 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 There have been no material changes in risk factors applicable to the Company from those disclosed in Risk Factors in Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 2024 Phantom Stock Plan . 
 On February 22, 2024, the Company adopted the Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation 2024 Phantom Stock Plan (the Phantom Stock Plan ), effective as of February 22, 2024, to promote the long-term financial success of the Company and its subsidiaries by providing a means to attract, retain and reward individuals who contribute to such success and to further align their interests with those of the Company s shareholders. Any employee or director of the Company or a subsidiary selected by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the Committee is eligible to participate in the Plan. 
 
 Pursuant to the Phantom Stock Plan, the Company may grant phantom stock units and phantom stock appreciation units to eligible participants. A phantom stock unit represents the right to receive a cash payment on the determination date established by the Committee equal to the value of a share of the Company s stock on the determination date. A phantom stock appreciation unit represents the right to receive a cash payment on the determination date established by the Committee equal to the positive difference between the strike price on the grant date and the tangible book value of a share of the Company s stock on the determination date. 
 
 The awards granted may be subject to either time-based vesting or pre-established performance goals. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the required period of service for full vesting will generally be three years for all awards, subject to acceleration of vesting in the event of the participant s death, disability, involuntary termination without cause within two years following the occurrence of a change in control, and retirement. In the event of separation of service (as defined in the Plan) for any reason other than disability, death or termination without cause within two years following the occurrence of a change in control, or retirement, unvested awards will be forfeited. In the event of termination for cause, the awards granted to a participant will 
 71 

expire and be forfeited. Upon separation of service due to disability or death, all awards granted to the participant will become fully vested and payment of the cash value of the awards will be made no later than 75 days after the participant s separation of service. At the time of an involuntary termination without cause within two years following a change in control, the awards held by a participant will be deemed to have been fully earned and the cash value of outstanding awards will be paid no later than 75 days after the change in control. To the extent vesting of any performance awards is accelerated, vesting will be pro-rata, based target achievement (or actual achievement, if higher) of the performance goals and on the number of completed months in the performance period. 
 
 Amended and Restated Deferred Restricted Stock Unit Plan . 
 On October 2, 2024, the Company adopted the Amended and Restated Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation Restricted Stock Unit Deferred Compensation Plan, effective as of October 2, 2024 (the RSU Deferral Plan ). The RSU Deferral Plan is provided to directors and a select group of management and highly compensated employees, including the named executive officers listed in the Corporation s proxy statement. Pursuant to the amended and restated plan, prior to the applicable plan year, participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their grants of restricted stock units, phantom stock units, or similar awards to a deferral account maintained on behalf of the participant. Participants are at all times 100 vested in their deferral accounts. Subject to certain limitations designated by the Board of Directors of the Company, a participant may direct the investment of the participant s deferral account in certain investment funds options or in shares of Company common stock. The deferral account will generally be paid on the earliest to occur of separation from employment, a scheduled distribution date (if elected by the participant), death, disability, or in the event of a change in control (if elected by the participant). The deferral account will be distributed either in a lump sum or in annual installments (of up to 15 years) in accordance with the participant s pre-established election. If the distribution is due to a scheduled distribution date or retirement (separation from service after age 62); if the distribution is for any other reason, the distribution shall be made in a lump sum payment. 
 
 The foregoing descriptions of the Phantom Stock Plan and the RSU Deferral Plan do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Phantom Stock Plan, form of time-based Phantom Stock Unit Award Agreement, form of performance-based Phantom Stock Unit Award Agreement, and the RSU Deferral Plan, copies of which are included as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, to this report on Form 10-Q and incorporated by reference into this Item 5.

Exhibit 10.1 
 
 PEAPACK-GLADSTONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION 
 
 2024 PHANTOM STOCK PLAN ARTICLE 1 GENERAL 
 
 	 Section 1.1 	 Purpose, Effective Date and Term . The purpose of this Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation 2024 Phantom Stock Plan (the Plan is to promote the long-term financial success of Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation , a New Jersey bank holding company (the Company ), by providing a means to attract, retain and reward individuals who contribute to the Company s success and to further align their interests with those of the Company. The Effective Date of the Plan is February 22, 2024. 
 	 Section 1.2 	 Administration . The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board in accordance with Section 5.1 . 
 	 Section 1.3 	 Plan Year . The Plan Year shall be January 1 to December 31. 
 	 Section 1.4 	 Participation . Any person who is granted and holds an Award in accordance with the terms of the Plan shall be a Participant in the Plan. Awards under the Plan shall be limited to Eligible Employees and Directors of the Company or any other Subsidiary. 
 	 Section 1.5 	 Definitions . Capitalized terms in the Plan shall be defined as set forth in the Plan (including the definitions contained in Article 9 ). 
 ARTICLE 2 - AWARDS 
 	 Section 2.1 	 General . Each Award under the Plan shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and such additional terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions as the Committee shall provide with respect to such Award and as evidenced in the Award Agreement. The only Awards that may be granted under the Plan are Phantom Stock Units and Phantom Stock Appreciation Units and any Award may be granted as a performance award. 
 Section 2.2 	 Settlement of Awards . 
 (a) Phantom Stock Unit . A Phantom Stock Unit Award shall be settled within 75 days after the date on which the Award vests or as otherwise specified in this Plan or the Award Agreement, in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be established by the Committee. The settlement of a Phantom Stock Unit shall be in cash, subject to applicable tax withholding. 

(b) Phantom Stock Appreciation Unit . A Phantom Stock Appreciation Unit Award shall be settled within 75 days after the date on which the Award vests or as otherwise specified in this Plan or the Award Agreement, in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be established by the Committee. The settlement of a Phantom Stock Appreciation Unit shall be in cash, subject to applicable tax withholding. 

Section 2.3 	 Vesting of Awards . The Committee shall specify the vesting schedule and/or market or performance conditions of each Award at the time of grant. The vesting period of an Award under the Plan shall be determined by the Committee, and unless otherwise specified by the Committee in an applicable Award Agreement, the vesting period will accelerate in the event of the Participant s Retirement, death, Disability, or an involuntary termination without Cause (including resignation for Good Reason) following the occurrence of a Change in Control. 
 	 Section 2.4 	 Deferred Compensation . It is the Company s intention that this Plan shall not be considered a deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Code Section 409A. Accordingly, the Awards are designed so that they shall not be considered non-qualified deferred compensation as defined under Code Section 409A Deferred Compensation ). Payments of Awards are made upon vesting and thus satisfy the short-term deferral exception under Code Section 409A. Nonetheless, the Committee reserves the absolute right (including the right to delegate such right) to unilaterally amend the Plan or any Award Agreement, without the consent of the Participant, if necessary to avoid the 

Awards being treated as Deferred Compensation. Any amendment by the Committee to the Plan or an Award Agreement pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall maintain, to the extent practicable, the original intent of the applicable provision without violating Code Section 409A. A Participant s acceptance of any Award under the Plan constitutes acknowledgement and consent to such rights of the Committee, without further consideration or action. Any discretionary authority retained by the Committee pursuant to the terms of this Plan or pursuant to an Award Agreement shall not be applicable to an Award if such discretionary authority would contravene Code Section 409A. 
 	 Section 2.5 	 Effect of Separation from Service on Awards. The Committee shall establish the effect of a Separation from Service on the continuation of rights and benefits available under an Award or this Plan and, in so doing, may make distinctions based upon, among other things, the cause of Separation from Service. Unless the Committee shall specifically state otherwise at the time an Award is granted and evidences such intent in an Award Agreement, the following provisions shall apply to each Award granted under this Plan: 
 
 (a) 	 Upon the Separation from Service for any reason other than Retirement, Disability, death, or termination without Cause (including a resignation for Good Reason) with two years following the occurrence of a Change in Control, any unvested Phantom Stock Units and/or Phantom Stock Appreciation Units shall be forfeited. 
 
 (b) 	 Upon the Separation from Service for reason of Retirement, Disability or death, all Phantom Stock Unit Awards and/or Phantom Stock Appreciation Units subject to vesting conditions solely based on continued Service of the Participant shall become fully vested and payment of the cash value of the Phantom Stock Unit Award and/or Phantom Stock Appreciation Units shall be made no later than 75 days after the Participant s Separation from Service. Any Awards that vest based on the achievement of performance targets shall vest, pro-rata, by multiplying (i) the number of Awards that would be obtained based on achievement at target (or if actual achievement of the performance measures is greater than the target level, at the actual achievement level) as of the date of Retirement, Disability or death, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months the Participant was in Service during the performance period and the denominator of which is the number of months in the performance period. 
 
 (c) 	 In the event of a termination for Cause, all Phantom Stock Unit Awards and Phantom Stock Appreciation Units granted to a Participant under the Plan shall immediately expire and be forfeited. 
 
 (d) 	 The effect of a Change in Control on the vesting of Phantom Stock Unit Awards and Phantom Stock Appreciation Units is as set forth in Article 4 hereof. 

Section 2.6 	 Valuation of Awards . 
 
 The cash value of a Phantom Stock Unit Award shall be an amount equal to the Fair Market Value on the Determination Date. The cash value of a Phantom Stock Appreciation Unit shall be an amount equal to the positive difference between the Fair Market Value on the Determination Date reduced by the Strike Price. 
 
 ARTICLE 3 SHARES OF PHANTOM STOCK SUBJECT TO PLAN 
 Section 3.1 	 Phantom Stock Authorized . 
 The aggregate number of Phantom Stock Units and Phantom Stock Appreciation Units available for Awards granted under this Plan at any time shall be determined from time to time by the Committee. 
 Section 3.2 	 Permitted Adjustments for Certain Transactions . 
 In the event any recapitalization, reclassification, forward or reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, or exchange of shares of Company common stock Stock or other securities, stock dividend or other special and non-recurring dividend or distribution (whether in the form of cash, securities or other property), liquidation, dissolution, or increase or decrease in the number of shares of Stock without consideration, or similar corporate transaction or event, affects the shares of Stock such that an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants under the Plan and/or under any Award granted under the Plan, then the 

Committee shall, in an equitable manner, adjust the number of Phantom Stock Unit Awards and Phantom Stock Appreciation Units that may vest and be settled with respect to outstanding Awards. In addition, the Committee is authorized to adjust the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Phantom Stock Unit Awards and/or Phantom Stock Appreciation Units (including, without limitation, cancellation of any such Awards in exchange for the in-the-money value, if any, of the vested portion thereof, or substitution or exchange of any such Awards for similar awards denominated in units of a successor or other entity) in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events (including, without limitation, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses or assets) affecting the Company or any parent or Subsidiary or the financial statements of the Company or any parent or Subsidiary, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles.

 [Signature Page Follows on Exhibit C] 

EXHIBIT A 
 
 (a) Performance Period: 

(b) Performance Measure: 

The performance measure for the Performance Phantom Stock Awards is based on the following: 
 1. 60 based on the Company s cumulative earnings per share EPS growth as compared to the cumulative EPS growth of each member of a selected peer group of the Company as set forth in Exhibit B (the Peer Group during the Performance Period; 

2. 20 based on [liquidity growth as compared to the cumulative liquidity growth of each member of the Peer Group during the Performance Period]; and 

3. 20 based on [credit growth as compared to the cumulative credit growth of each member of the Peer Group during the Performance Period]. 

The Committee, in its sole discretion, may modify the Peer Group to reflect changes to the Peer Group members (e.g., as a result of a merger). The Committee, in its sole discretion and in accordance with the Plan, may also make adjustments to the actual EPS, liquidity and/or credit growth results of the Company to reflect non-recurring or unusual items during the Performance Period. 
 Vesting of the Performance Phantom Stock Awards is based on the Company s cumulative EPS growth performance relative to the Peer Group during the Performance Period as follows: 

Threshold Cumulative EPS, Liquidity, and Credit Growth During the Performance Period Compared to the Peer Group (25 th Percentile) 
 Target Cumulative EPS, Liquidity, and Credit Growth During the Performance Period Compared to the Peer Group (50 th Percentile) 
 Maximum Cumulative EPS, Liquidity, and Credit Growth During the Performance Period Compared to the Peer Group (75 th Percentile) 

If the Company s cumulative EPS, liquidity, and credit growth during the Performance Period falls: (1) below the Threshold level; (2) between the Threshold and Target levels; or (3) between the Target and Maximum levels, the number of Performance Phantom Stock Awards earned will be calculated by interpolating between payout levels for performance between performance levels. In no event shall the number of Performance Phantom Stock Awards earned exceed the number of awards at the Maximum level, regardless if the Company s cumulative EPS, liquidity, and credit growth during the Performance Period is greater than the 75 th percentile of the Peer Group.

(b) Timing of Deferral Elections for Newly Eligible Plan Participants . A Director or selected Employee who first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan on or after the beginning of a Plan Year, as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(a)(7)(ii) and the plan aggregation rules provided in Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(c)(2), may be permitted to make an election to defer the portion of RSUs attributable to services to be performed after such election, provided that the Participant submits an Election Form on or before the deadline established by the Board, which in no event shall be later than thirty (30) days after the Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan. 

Any deferral election made in accordance with this Section 3.2(b) shall become irrevocable no later than the 30 th day after the date the Director or selected Employee becomes eligible to participate in the Plan. 
 (c) Timing of Special Deferral Elections for RSUs Subject to the Short-Term Deferral Exception. Subject to the limitations described below, an irrevocable deferral election will be permitted prior to the Effective Date for unvested RSUs that were granted prior to the Effective Date. Such a Special Deferral Election will only be permissible with respect to RSUs that are determined to qualify for the short-term deferral exception set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), and such Special Deferral Election must comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A- 2(a)(4). The Special Deferral Election will only apply to RSUs that otherwise would have become vested at least twelve (12) months following the date of the Special Deferral Election, and such RSUs must be deferred for a period of at least five (5) years following the date on which they otherwise would have become vested (except in the case of a Change in Control, if the Participant so elects). 

3.3. Withholding and Crediting of RSUs. For each Plan Year, Shares attributable to RSUs that otherwise would have become vested and delivered to the Participant shall instead be delivered to the Trust, and shall be credited to his or her RSU Account as soon as reasonably practicable after such amounts would otherwise have been paid to the Participant. 

9 

3.4. Vesting. A Participant shall at all times be 100 vested in his or her RSU and Dividend Contribution Accounts. 

3.5. Deferral Accounts. The Company shall establish Accounts for each Participant under the Plan for each tranche of deferred RSUs, as well as the Participant s Dividend Contribution Account and an Investment Account. Deferred RSUs shall remain credited and denominated as RSUs or Shares in the RSU Deferral Account, subject to an investment election made by the Participant to transfer the value, or a portion of, the RSU Deferral Account to the Investment Account pursuant to Section 3.6. A Participant s Dividend Contribution Account may be transferred to the Investment Account pursuant to the Participant s election pursuant to Section 3.6. Cash deferred to directly to the Investment Account, or transferred from the RSU Deferral Account or Dividend Contribution Account, will be allocated the Investment Fund(s) elected by the Participant. A Participant s Deferral Accounts shall be credited as follows: 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after amounts are permitted to be invested in Investment Fund, the Board shall credit the applicable Investment Funds of the Participant s applicable Account(s), or subaccounts, with an amount determined as set forth herein, and the portion of the Participant s Account(s) that the Participant has deemed to be invested in a certain type of investment fund shall be credited to the investment fund subaccount corresponding to that investment fund; 

(b) Each business day, each Investment Fund subaccount of a Participant s Account(s) shall be credited with earnings or losses in an amount equal to that determined by multiplying the balance credited to such Investment Fund subaccount as of the prior day by the rate of net gain or loss for the corresponding Investment Fund for that day; and 

(c) A Participant s deferrals into the Plan shall be accounted for in a manner which allows separate accounting for the deferrals and investment gains and losses associated with amounts allocated to each separate Account. 

(d) Each of the Participant s investment fund subaccounts shall be reduced pro rata from the applicable Account by the amount of any distributions made to the Participant, as of the date of the distribution. 

3.6. Investment Elections. 

(a) The Board shall select from time to time, in its sole and absolute discretion, commercially available investment funds to be used to determine the amount of earnings or losses to be credited to the Participant s Accounts under the Plan (the Investment Funds ). A Participant may elect to transfer all or a portion of the RSU Deferral Account and/or the Dividend Contribution Account to the Investment Account to be invested in the Investment Funds, and a Participant may elect to transfer all or a portion of the Investment Account and/or the Dividend Contribution Account to the RSU Deferral Account. Such elections may be made no more frequently than once per fiscal quarter (or as further limited in the discretion of the Board) and shall be processed on, or as soon as practicable following, the first business day of the following fiscal quarter. 

10 

(b) Each Participant shall designate, on the Election Form or thereafter, the Investment Fund or Funds in which the Participant s applicable Accounts (including the Dividend Contribution Account) will be deemed to be invested for purposes of determining the amount of earnings or losses to be allocated to that Account. The Participant may specify that the deemed investment be, in whole percentage increments, in one or more of the investment funds as communicated from time to time. Effective as of any business day, a Participant may change this investment designation by filing a change of election and making a new designation. If a Participant does not elect any of the investment funds as described in this Section for one or more Accounts, the applicable Account balance shall automatically be allocated into the lowest-risk investment fund, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board, in its sole discretion, may impose limitations on the frequency with which one or more of the investment funds elected in accordance with this Section may be added or deleted by such Participant; furthermore, the Board, in its sole discretion, may impose limitations on the frequency with which the Participant may change the portion of his or her Accounts allocated to each previously or newly elected Investment Fund. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan that may be interpreted to the contrary, the investment funds selected by the Board or designation of investment funds by a Participant shall not be considered or construed in any manner as an actual investment of the Participant s Account Balance in any such investment fund. In the event that the Company or the Trustee, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall invest funds in any or all of the selected investment funds, no Participant shall have any rights in or to such investments. Without limiting the foregoing, a Participant s Account Balance shall at all times be a bookkeeping entry only and shall not represent any investment made on his or her behalf by the Company or the Trust; the Participant shall remain at all times an unsecured creditor of the Company.
