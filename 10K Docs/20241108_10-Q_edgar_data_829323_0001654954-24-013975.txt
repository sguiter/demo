As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately million in cash and cash equivalents. Our net working capital deficit was million. We have encountered recurring losses and cash outflows from operations, which historically we have funded through equity offerings and debt facilities.

The credit facility is due upon demand and therefore there can be no assurances that sufficient borrowings will be available to support future operations until profitability is reached. Our collection period is less than 30 days and can also be used to meet accrued obligations. We believe our current cash position and credit facility will be sufficient to sustain operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of this filing.

The use of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense and include the expected life of the option, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, exercise price, and forfeiture rate. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period. The forfeiture rate, which is estimated at a weighted average of of unvested options outstanding, is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Company Overview Inuvo is an advertising technology and services business selling information technology solutions to brands, agencies and large consolidators of advertising demand Platforms ). Inuvo s revenue is derived from the placement of digital advertising throughout devices, websites, applications and browsers across social, search and programmatic advertising channels. Inuvo facilitates, and gets paid, to deliver millions of advertising messages monthly and counts among its client's numerous world-renowned companies across industries. Inuvo s primary mission is to disrupt the advertising industry with its proprietary and patented generative large language artificial intelligence (AI), a technology capable of identifying and targeting audiences without using a consumer s identity or data. The AI was designed to replace the consumer data, analytics, segmentation and lookalike modeling technologies that have traditionally served the advertising industry as it transitions to a new paradigm where a consumer s identity and data are no longer available for advertising decisions due to legislative and technological changes. Rather than targeting people, the AI targets the reasons behind why people are interested in products, services and brands. Inuvo s AI technology solves this challenge and can be consumed by clients both as a managed service and software-as-a-service. For certain clients, Inuvo has also developed various proprietary technology and assets that include digital content, websites, automated campaigns, ad fraud detection, performance reporting and predictive media mix modeling. The Inuvo products and services use analytics, data and artificial intelligence in a manner that optimizes the purchase and placement of advertising in real time. These capabilities are typically sold with services both individually and in combination with each other based on client needs. These products and services include: IntentKey : An artificial intelligence-based consumer intent recognition system designed to reach highly targeted mobile and desktop In-Market audiences with precision; and Bonfire : A marketing and advertising solution where a collection of data, analytics, software and publishing is used to align advertising messages with consumers across websites online. There are many barriers to entry associated with the Inuvo business model, including a proficiency in large language model based artificial intelligence, large scale information processing, software development, consumer data products, analytics, IOT (internet of things) integration and the relationships required to execute within the IOT. Inuvo s intellectual property is protected by 19 issued and six pending patents. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The estimates and assumptions that management makes affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions used are based upon management s regular evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies related to Revenue Recognition, Equity-Based Compensation, Capitalized Software Costs, Goodwill, Long-lived Assets and others are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 18 Table of Contents Results of Operations For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Net Revenue 22,371,153 24,570,588 (2,199,435 (9.0 57,603,935 53,069,433 4,534,502 8.5 Cost of Revenue 2,594,642 2,274,626 320,016 14.1 7,599,872 7,833,729 (233,857 (3.0 Gross Profit 19,776,511 22,295,962 (2,519,451 (11.3 50,004,063 45,235,704 4,768,359 10.5 Net Revenue Revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased 9.0 and revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, increased 8.5 as compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively.

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the increase in cost of revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was related to the higher revenue within Agencies Brands in this year's quarter. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in cost of revenue compared to the same period in 2023 was attributed to lower revenue within Agencies Brands during the comparable period. Operating Expenses For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Marketing costs 17,006,131 17,625,806 (619,675 (3.5 42,540,355 36,769,972 5,770,383 15.7 Compensation 3,106,384 3,525,943 (419,559 (11.9 9,362,474 10,202,200 (839,726 (8.2 General and administrative 1,607,258 2,335,295 (728,037 (31.2 3,835,162 6,229,069 (2,393,907 (38.4 Operating expenses 21,719,773 23,487,044 (1,767,271 (7.5 55,737,991 53,201,241 2,536,750 4.8 Marketing costs consist mostly of traffic acquisition (i.e., media) costs and include those expenses required to attract an audience to various web properties. Marketing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.5 lower than the same quarter last year primarily due to lower revenue derived from Platform advertisers. Marketing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 15.7 higher compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to higher revenue from Platform advertisers in the comparable periods. In the third quarter of 2024 we fully amortized the remaining balance of the referral and support services asset (see Note 7 - Commitments of our Consolidated Financial Statements) increasing the Marketing costs in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Compensation expense was 420,000 lower for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 840,000 lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same time periods in 2023 primarily due to lower stock-based compensation and accrued incentive expense. Our total employment, both full- and part-time, was 82 at September 30, 2024 compared to 86 at September 30, 2023. 19 Table of Contents General and administrative costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 31.2 and 38.4 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to an adjustment in the reserve for expected credit losses. During 2024, we made an adjustment to the allowance for expected credit losses for a balance due from a former client in 2022. The client has since paid off their full outstanding balance and no longer has any obligation to us as of September 30, 2024. Financing expense, net Financing expense, net of interest income, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 101,000 and 163,000, respectively. Financing (expense), net of interest income, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was approximately 20,000 income and 37,000 expense, respectively. The higher expenses in this year s periods compared to last year was due to the amortization of the closing costs of the new credit agreement (see Note 5 Bank Debt of our Consolidated Financial Statements) and to higher overall borrowing balances. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are the sale of our common stock and our credit facility discussed in Note 5 - Bank Debt of our Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 7, 2024, we entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co. LLC Wainwright ), to sell shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share, (the Shares ), having an aggregate sales price of up to 15,000,000, from time to time, through an at the market offering program under which Wainwright will act as sales agent. The sales, if any, of the Shares made under the ATM Agreement will be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company will pay Wainwright a commission rate of up to 3.0 of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of Shares. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company has not sold any shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement. On July 31, 2024, we entered into a Financing and Security Agreement (the "Financing Agreement with SLR Digital Finance LLC ("SLR ), effective July 30, 2024. Pursuant to the terms of the Financing Agreement, SLR will finance up to 10 million dependent upon eligible receivables. See Note 5 Bank Debt of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have focused our resources behind a plan to market our collective multi-channel advertising capabilities differentiated by our AI technology, the IntentKey, where we have a technological advantage and higher margins. If we are successful in implementing our plan, we expect to return to positive cash flows from operations. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve this objective. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 2.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our net working capital deficit was 3.4 million. We have encountered recurring losses and cash outflows from operations, which historically we have funded through equity offerings and debt facilities. In addition, our investment in internally developed software consists primarily of labor costs which are of a fixed nature. Through September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 173.4 million. Management plans to support the Company s future operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash generated from its credit facility until such time as we reach profitability. The credit facility is due upon demand and therefore there can be no assurances that sufficient borrowings will be available to support future operations until profitability is reached. Our collection period is less than 30 days and can also be used to meet accrued obligations. We believe our current cash position and credit facility will be sufficient to sustain operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of this filing. If our plan to grow the IntentKey product is unsuccessful, we may need to fund operations through private or public sales of securities, debt financings or partnering/licensing transactions over the long term. 20 Table of Contents Cash Flows The table below sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (100,345 (457,716 Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities (1,409,762 1,029,656 Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities (343,526 3,475,126 Cash Flows - Operating Net cash used in operating activities was 100,345 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We reported a net loss of 5,903,142, which included non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization expense of 1,951,196, depreciation of right of use assets of 48,317, stock-based compensation expense of 1,087,533, and 800,000 for the impairment and amortization of a referral and support services agreement. The change in operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a net provision of cash of 4,185,284 primarily due to a decrease of 1,899,029 in accounts receivable and an increase of accrued and other liabilities of 940,076. Our terms are such that we generally collect receivables prior to paying trade payables. However, our Media sales arrangements typically have slower payment terms than the terms of related payables. During the comparable nine-month period in 2023, cash used in operating activities was 457,716 from a net loss of 7,988,323 and included several non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization expense of 1,984,139 and stock-based compensation expense of 1,471,683. The change in operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was a net provision of cash of 3,265,938. Cash Flows - Investing Net cash used in investing activities was 1,409,762 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of capitalized internal development costs. Net cash provided by investing activities was 1,029,656 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted primarily of the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by capitalized internal development costs. Cash Flows - Financing Net cash used in financing activities was 343,526 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was primarily due to taxes paid on restricted stock unit grants exercised. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 3,475,126 and was primarily from proceeds from the capital raise (see Note 1 - Organization and Business of our Consolidated Financial Statements). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term "off-balance sheet arrangement" generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Not applicable to a smaller reporting company. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed by SEC rules and regulations, and to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control. The design of any systems of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, our management concluded their evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. As of the evaluation date, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed by SEC rules and regulations, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 22 Table of Contents PART II Item 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS-UPDATE We desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Accordingly, we incorporate by reference the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024 and our subsequent filings with the SEC, subject to the new or modified risk factors appearing below that should be read in conjunction with the risk factors disclosed in such Form 10-K and our subsequent filings. We rely on one customer for a significant portion of our revenues. We are reliant upon one customer for most of our revenue. For the three-month period ending September 30, 2024, one Platform customer accounted for 79.9 of our overall revenue, and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, 76.5 of our overall revenue. The amount of revenue we receive from this customer is dependent on a number of factors outside of our control, including changes in the respective customers advertising budget, both in terms of allocated dollars and media mix, financial resources of the customers, as well as general economic conditions. We would likely experience a significant decline in revenue and our business operations could be significantly harmed if these customers do not continue to utilize our services. Additionally, our business operations and financial condition could be significantly harmed if these customers do not pay for our services on a timely basis. The loss of any of these customers or a material change in the revenue or gross profit they generate or their failure to timely pay us for our services would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in future periods.
