 Real estate (2) Sponsored investment funds (3) Residential mortgage loans (4) Asset-backed limited partnership (5) Total 

 (1) The assets of the mandatory retirement savings funds primarily include separate account assets and equity securities. The liabilities primarily include separate account liabilities. (2) The assets of the real estate VIEs primarily include real estate, other investments and cash. Liabilities primarily include other liabilities. (3) The assets of sponsored investment funds are primarily fixed maturities and equity securities, certain of which are reported with other investments, and cash. The consolidated statements of financial position included a million and million redeemable noncontrolling interest for sponsored investment funds as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. (4) The assets of the residential mortgage loans VIEs primarily include residential mortgage loans. The liabilities primarily include other liabilities. (5) The assets of the asset-backed limited partnership VIE primarily include consumer loans, auto loans, other loans and credit facilities. These assets are reported with cash and cash equivalents, other investments and fixed maturities, trading on the consolidated statements of financial position. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any unfunded commitments to the VIE. Unfunded commitments are not liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position because we are only required to fund additional capital when called upon to do so by the investment manager. Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities We hold a variable interest in a number of VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. Our investments in these VIEs are reported in fixed maturities, available-for-sale; fixed maturities, trading; equity securities and other investments in the consolidated statements of financial position and are described below. Unconsolidated VIEs include certain commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS ), residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities RMBS and other ABS. All of these entities were deemed VIEs because the equity within these entities is insufficient to sustain them. We determined we are not the primary beneficiary in the entities within these categories of investments. This determination was based primarily on the fact we do not own the class of security that controls the unilateral right to replace the special servicer or equivalent function. We invest in cash collateralized debt obligations, collateralized bond obligations, collateralized loan obligations and other collateralized structures, which are VIEs due to insufficient equity to sustain the entities. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities primarily because we do not control the economic performance of the entities and were not involved with the design of the entities or because we do not have a potentially significant variable interest in the entities for which we are the asset manager.

 Financing Receivables Mortgage Loans Mortgage loans consist of commercial and residential mortgage loans. Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of non-recourse, fixed rate mortgages on stabilized properties. Our residential mortgage loan portfolio is composed of first lien and home equity mortgages concentrated in Chile and the United States. Commercial and residential mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. Amortized cost excludes accrued interest receivable. The amortized cost of our residential mortgage loans also includes basis adjustments related to fair value hedges in a closed portfolio. See Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further information. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan s contractual interest rate. Interest income, as well as prepayment of fees and the amortization of the related premium or discount, is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest receivable is reported in accrued investment income on the consolidated statements of financial position. Any changes in the loan valuation allowances are reported in net realized capital gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Further details relating to our valuation allowance are included under the caption Financing Receivables Valuation Allowance. Direct Financing Leases Our direct financing leases are concentrated in Chile. Our Chilean operations enter into private placement contracts for commercial, industrial and office space properties whereby our Chilean operations purchase the real estate and/or building from the seller-lessee but then lease the property back to the seller-lessee. Ownership of the property is transferred to the lessee by the end of the lease term. Direct financing leases are reported as a component of other investments in the consolidated statements of financial position.

Financing Receivables Credit Monitoring Commercial Mortgage Loan Credit Risk Profile Based on Internal Rating We actively monitor and manage our commercial mortgage loan and direct financing lease portfolios. All commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases are analyzed regularly and substantially all are internally rated, based on a proprietary risk rating cash flow model, in order to monitor the financial quality of these assets. The models stress expected cash flows at various levels and at different points in time depending on the durability of the income stream, which includes our assessment of factors such as location (macro and micro markets), tenant quality and lease expirations. Our internal rating analysis presents expected losses in terms of an S P Global S P bond equivalent rating for domestic commercial mortgage loans and Feller rate equivalent for Chilean commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases. As the credit risk for commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases increases, we adjust our internal ratings downward with loans in the category B+ and below having the highest risk for credit loss. Internal ratings on commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases are updated at least annually and potentially more often for certain investments with material changes in collateral value or occupancy and for investments on an internal watch list . Commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases that require more frequent and detailed attention are identified and placed on an internal watch list . Among the criteria that may indicate a potential problem are significant negative changes in ratios of loan to value or contract rents to debt service, major tenant vacancies or bankruptcies, borrower sponsorship problems, late payments, delinquent taxes and loan relief/restructuring requests.

 or greater delinquent or on non-accrual status. We define non-performing residential first lien mortgages in the Chilean market as loans that have missed a specified number of coupon payments based on the nature of the loans and collection practices in that market. Other Loans Credit Risk Profile Based on Performance Status Our other loans are monitored based on performance of the loans. Monitoring on other loans increases when the loan is delinquent or earlier if there is an indication of potential impairment. Non-Accrual Financing Receivables Financing receivables are placed on non-accrual status if we have concern regarding the collectability of future payments or if a financing receivable has matured without being paid off or extended. Factors considered may include conversations with the borrower, loss of major tenant, bankruptcy of borrower or major tenant, decreased property cash flow for commercial mortgage loans and direct financing leases or number of days past due and other circumstances for residential mortgage loans. Based on an assessment as to the collectability of the principal, a determination is made to apply any payments received either against the principal, against the valuation allowance or according to the contractual terms. When a financing receivable is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued unpaid interest receivable is reversed against interest income. Accrual of interest resumes after factors resulting in doubts about collectability have improved. Financing receivables in the Chilean market are carried on accrual for a longer period of delinquency than domestic financing receivables, as assessment of collectability is based on the nature of the financing receivables and collection practices in that market. The amortized cost of financing receivables on non-accrual status was as follows: Residential mortgage loans Total

 Financing Receivables Valuation Allowance We establish a valuation allowance to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in our financing receivables. The valuation allowance is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated expected credit losses. The valuation allowance is based on amortized cost excluding accrued interest receivable and includes reserves for pools of financing receivables with similar risk characteristics. We do not measure a credit loss allowance on accrued interest receivable because we write off the uncollectible accrued interest receivable balance to net investment income in a timely manner, generally within 90 days domestically or, in the Chilean market, based on the nature of the loans and collection practices in that market. During 2024 and 2023, we did not write off any commercial mortgage loan accrued interest receivable or residential mortgage loan accrued interest receivable.

 or more, in process of foreclosure, restructured, on the internal watch list or that currently is evaluated individually. We analyze the need for an individual evaluation for any Chilean commercial mortgage loan or direct financing lease that is considered past due based on collection practices in the Chilean market and the nature of the loan or lease. We estimate expected credit losses for certain commercial mortgage loan or direct financing lease commitments where we have a contractual obligation to extend credit. The expected credit losses are estimated based on the commercial mortgage loan or direct financing lease valuation allowance process described previously, adjusted for probability of funding. The estimated expected credit losses for commercial mortgage loan and direct financing lease commitments are reported in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position. The change in the credit loss liability for commitments is included in net realized capital gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Once funded, expected credit losses for commercial mortgage loans or direct financing leases are included within the commercial mortgage loan or direct financing lease valuation allowance described previously. We evaluate residential mortgage loans based on aggregated risk factors and historical loss experience by pool type. We adjust these quantitative factors for qualitative factors of present and forecasted conditions. Qualitative factors include items such as economic and business conditions, changes in the portfolio, value of underlying collateral and concentrations. A residential mortgage loan is evaluated individually if it does not continue to share similar risk characteristics of a pool. We analyze the need for an individual evaluation for any domestic residential mortgage loan that is delinquent for or more, in process of foreclosure, restructured, on the internal watch list or that currently is evaluated individually. We analyze the need for an individual evaluation for any Chilean residential mortgage loan that is considered past due based on collection practices in the Chilean market and the nature of the loan. As discussed previously, commercial and residential mortgage loans and direct financing leases are evaluated individually if the asset does not continue to share similar risk characteristics of a pool. When we determine a commercial or residential mortgage loan is probable of foreclosure, a valuation allowance is established equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value of the collateral reduced by the cost to sell. For certain commercial mortgage loans where repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, we elect to establish a valuation allowance equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value of the real estate collateral, which may be reduced by the cost to sell. Estimated value may also be based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the asset s effective interest rate or the asset s observable market price. Subsequent changes in the estimated value are reflected in the valuation allowance. Amounts on financing receivables deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and removed from the valuation allowance. The change in the valuation allowance for loans and direct financing leases is included in net realized capital gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations.

 Middle Atlantic East North Central West North Central South Atlantic East South Central West South Central Mountain Pacific International Total Property type distribution Office Retail Industrial Apartments Hotel Mixed use/other Total Mortgage Loan Modifications Our commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios include loans that have been modified. We assess loan modifications that are related to our borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or a term extension (or a combination thereof). Generally, an assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of the modification. The financing receivables valuation allowance utilizes an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and it is recorded on each loan upon origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the valuation allowance is historical loss information, which includes losses from modification of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the valuation allowance because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the valuation allowance is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, a modification of a loan from a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is in the form of principal forgiveness. When principal forgiveness is provided as a modification, the amount of the principal forgiven is deemed uncollectible. Therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, which results in a reduction of the amortized cost and a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance. In some cases, we modify a loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness may be granted.

 The financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements or similar agreements include right of setoff provisions. Derivative instruments include provisions to setoff positions covered under the agreements with the same counterparties and provisions to setoff positions outside of the agreements with the same counterparties in the event of default by one of the parties. Derivative instruments also include collateral or variation margin provisions, which are generally settled daily with each counterparty. See Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further details. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements include provisions to setoff other repurchase and reverse repurchase balances with the same counterparty. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements also include collateral provisions with the counterparties. For reverse repurchase agreements we require the counterparties to pledge collateral with a value greater than the amount of cash transferred. We have the right but do not sell or repledge collateral received in reverse repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements are structured as secured borrowings for all counterparties. We pledge fixed maturities available-for-sale, which the counterparties have the right to sell or repledge. Interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as part of operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Net proceeds related to repurchase agreements are reported as a component of financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We did not have any outstanding repurchase agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and principal payments are made by any party. Cash is paid or received based on the terms of the swap. We use interest rate swaps primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities and to mitigate the risks arising from timing mismatches between assets and liabilities (including duration mismatches). We also use interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the value of assets we anticipate acquiring and other anticipated transactions and commitments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against changes in the value of the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit GMWB MRB. The GMWB rider on our variable annuity products provides for guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits regardless of the actual performance of various equity and/or fixed income funds available with the product. Additionally, we utilize interest rate swaps to replicate the returns of floating rate assets. Interest rate options, including interest rate caps and interest rate floors, which can be combined to form interest rate collars, are contracts that entitle the purchaser to pay or receive the amounts, if any, by which a specified market rate exceeds a cap strike interest rate, or falls below a floor strike interest rate, respectively, at specified dates. We use interest rate options to manage prepayment risks in our assets and minimum guaranteed interest rates and lapse risks in our liabilities. A swaption is an option to enter into an interest rate swap at a future date. We have purchased swaptions to hedge interest rate exposure for certain assets and liabilities. Swaptions not only hedge against the downside risk, but also allow us to take advantage of any upside benefits. In exchange-traded futures transactions, we agree to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the values of which are determined by the values of designated classes of securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. We enter into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commissions merchants who are members of a trading exchange. We use exchange-traded interest rate futures to hedge against changes in value of the GMWB MRB in addition to the economic exposure to certain fund closures in process. Interest rate forwards, including to be announced TBA forwards, bond forwards and treasury forwards, are contracts to take delivery of a fixed income security at a specified price at a future date. TBA forwards deliver government guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. Bond forwards and treasury forwards deliver corporate or municipal and U.S. Treasury bonds, respectively. At inception of the TBA and certain treasury forward contracts we do not intend to take physical delivery. We intend to take delivery of the bond forwards referencing corporate, municipal and certain treasury bonds. We have used TBA forwards to gain exposure to the investment risk and return of agency mortgage-backed security pools in order to reduce asset and liability duration mismatch. Treasury forwards are used to hedge against changes in the value of the GMWB MRB and to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities. Bond forwards are used to gain leverage through synthetic exposure during the forward period and fix the purchase price of a bond at a specified date in future. Foreign Exchange Contracts Foreign currency risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk arises from foreign currency-denominated funding agreements issued to nonqualified institutional investors in the international market, foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, and our international operations, including expected cash flows and potential acquisition and divestiture activity. We use various derivatives to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency swaps are contracts in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, a series of principal and interest payments in one currency for that of another currency. Generally, the principal amount of each currency is exchanged at the beginning and termination of the currency swap by each party. The interest payments are primarily fixed-to-fixed rate; however, they may also be fixed-to-floating rate or floating-to-fixed rate. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty for payments made in the same currency at each due date. We use currency swaps to reduce market risks from changes in currency exchange rates with respect to investments or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that we either hold or intend to acquire or sell.

 million and million in cash and securities under collateral arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, to satisfy collateral and initial margin requirements associated with our derivative credit support agreements and FCM agreements. Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade rating from each of the major credit rating agencies on our debt. If the ratings on our debt were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of these provisions and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions.

With respect to derivatives containing collateral provisions, we posted collateral and initial margin of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in the normal course of business, which reflects netting under derivative agreements. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered on September 30, 2024, we would be required to post up to an additional million of collateral to our counterparties.

 Credit Derivatives Sold When we sell credit protection, we are exposed to the underlying credit risk similar to purchasing a fixed maturity security instrument. Our credit derivative contracts sold reference a single name or reference security (referred to as single name credit default swaps or single name total return swaps ). These instruments are either referenced in an OTC credit derivative transaction or embedded within an investment structure that has been fully consolidated into our financial statements. These credit derivative transactions are subject to events of default defined within the terms of the contract, which normally consist of bankruptcy, failure to pay, or modified restructuring of the reference entity and/or issue. If a default event occurs for a reference name or security, we are obligated to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the notional amount of the credit derivative transaction. As a result, our maximum future payment is equal to the notional amount of the credit derivative. In certain cases, we also may have purchased credit protection with identical underlyings to certain of our sold protection transactions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not purchase credit protection relating to our sold protection transactions. In certain circumstances, our potential loss could also be reduced by any amount recovered in the default proceedings of the underlying credit name.

 (1) Interest accretion is included within benefits, claims and settlement expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. (2) Includes inflation adjustments included within the liability for future policy benefits rollforward for interest accretion. Liability for Future Policy Benefits The liability for future policy benefits LFPB for individual and group annuities is generally equal to the present value of expected future policy benefit payments. The reserves are computed using assumptions for mortality and interest. Mortality rate assumptions are based on our experience and are periodically reviewed against both industry standards and experience. The LFPB for non-participating term life insurance, individual disability income contracts and individual and group long-term care contracts is generally equal to the present value of expected future policy benefit payments less the present value of expected net premiums. The reserves are computed using assumptions for mortality, interest, morbidity and lapse. An interest accretion rate is determined for an identified cohort and remains unchanged after the issue year. For policies issued on or prior to December 31, 2020, the interest accretion rate is based on the assumed investment yield when the business was issued. For policies issued after December 31, 2020, the interest accretion rate is based on the upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yields, which is generally equivalent to a single-A rated bond yield matched to the duration of our insurance liabilities, when the business was issued. The LFPB is remeasured to reflect current upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yields as of each reporting date. The liability is calculated by discounting cash flows using rate curves reflecting the currency and duration of the insurance liabilities. For discount rate tenors, or points on the curves, where the upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yields are not liquid or limited observable market data is available, we use various estimation techniques consistent with fair value measurement guidance.

Refer to Note 3, Investments, for information on our financing receivables valuation allowance related to the reinsurance recoverable and deposit receivable. Cost of Reinsurance A reinsurance asset or liability is established to spread the expected net reinsurance costs or profits over the expected term of the contracts. The cost of reinsurance asset and liability are reported in premiums due and other receivables and liability for future policy benefits and claims, respectively, on the consolidated statements of financial position. The cost of reinsurance asset and liability included on the consolidated statements of financial position were as follows: Cost of reinsurance liability Cost of reinsurance amortization, including the impacts of remeasurement, of million and ) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was reported in benefits, claims and settlement expenses and liability for future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss on the consolidated statements of operations.

 million. At inception, the fair value of such guarantees was insignificant. In addition, we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required. Therefore, any liability accrued within our consolidated statements of financial position is insignificant. Should we be required to perform under these guarantees, we generally could recover a portion of the loss from third parties through recourse provisions included in agreements with such parties, the sale of assets held as collateral that can be liquidated in the event performance is required under the guarantees or other recourse generally available to us; therefore, such guarantees would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. While the likelihood is remote, such outcomes could materially affect net income in a particular quarter or annual period. Furthermore, in connection with our contingent funding agreements, we are required to purchase any principal and interest strips of U.S. Treasury securities that are due and not paid from the associated unconsolidated trusts. The maximum exposure under these agreements as of September 30, 2024, was million. We manage mandatory privatized social security funds in Chile. By regulation, we have a required minimum guarantee on the funds relative return. Because the guarantee has no limitation with respect to duration or amount, the maximum exposure of the guarantee in the future is indeterminable. We are also subject to various other indemnification obligations issued in conjunction with divestitures, acquisitions, financing and reinsurance transactions whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Certain portions of these indemnifications may be capped, while other portions are not subject to such limitations; therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under the indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. At inception, the fair value of such indemnifications was insignificant. In addition, we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required. Therefore, any liability accrued within our consolidated statements of financial position is insignificant. While we are unable to estimate with certainty the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these indemnifications, we believe that performance under these indemnifications would not result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. While the likelihood is remote, performance under these indemnifications could materially affect net income in a particular quarter or annual period.

Noncontrolling interest that is not redeemable is reported in the equity section of the consolidated statements of financial position. The noncontrolling interest holders in certain of our consolidated entities maintain an equity interest that is redeemable at the option of the holder, which may be exercised on varying dates. Since redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control, this interest is excluded from stockholders equity and reported separately as redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statements of financial position.

 of our total fixed maturities were Level 3 securities valued using internal pricing models. The primary inputs, by asset class, for valuations of the majority of our Level 2 investments from third party pricing vendors or our internal pricing valuation approach are described below. U.S. Government and Agencies/Non-U.S. Governments . Inputs include recently executed market transactions, interest rate yield curves, maturity dates, market price quotations and credit spreads relating to similar instruments. States and Political Subdivisions . Inputs include Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board reported trades, U.S. Treasury and other benchmark curves, material event notices, new issue data and obligor credit ratings. Corporate . Inputs include recently executed transactions, market price quotations, benchmark yields, issuer spreads and observations of equity and credit default swap curves related to the issuer. For private placement corporate securities valued through the matrix valuation approach inputs include the current Treasury curve and risk spreads based on sector, rating and average life of the issuance. RMBS, CMBS, Collateralized Debt Obligations and Other Debt Obligations . Inputs include cash flows, priority of the tranche in the capital structure, expected time to maturity for the specific tranche, reinvestment period remaining and performance of the underlying collateral including prepayments, defaults, deferrals, loss severity of defaulted collateral and, for RMBS, prepayment speed assumptions. Other inputs include market indices and recently executed market transactions. Equity Securities Equity securities include mutual funds, common stock, non-redeemable preferred stock and required regulatory investments. Fair values of equity securities are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets when available, which are reflected in Level 1. When quoted prices are not available, we may utilize internal valuation methodologies appropriate for the specific asset that use observable inputs such as underlying share prices or the NAV, which are reflected in Level 2. Fair values might also be determined using broker quotes or through the use of internal models or analysis that incorporate significant assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities, which are reflected in Level 3. Derivatives The fair values of exchange-traded derivatives are determined through quoted market prices, which are reflected in Level 1. Exchange-traded derivatives include futures that are settled daily, which reduces their fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. The fair values of OTC cleared derivatives are determined through market prices published by the clearinghouses, which are reflected in Level 2. The clearinghouses utilize the secured overnight financing rate SOFR curve in their valuation. Variation margin associated with OTC cleared derivatives is settled daily, which reduces their fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position. The fair values of bilateral OTC derivative instruments are determined using either pricing valuation models that utilize market observable inputs or broker quotes. The majority of our bilateral OTC derivatives are valued with models that use market observable inputs, which are reflected in Level 2. Significant inputs include contractual terms, interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spread curves, equity prices and volatilities. These valuation models consider projected discounted cash flows, relevant swap curves and appropriate implied volatilities. Certain bilateral OTC derivatives utilize unobservable market data, primarily independent broker quotes that are nonbinding quotes based on models that do not reflect the result of market transactions, which are reflected in Level 3.

 Market comparable discount rates are used as the base rate in the discounted cash flows used to determine the fair value of certain assets. The use of a higher or lower discount rate would have caused the fair value of the assets to significantly decrease or increase, respectively. Additionally, we may adjust the base discount rate or the modeled price by applying an illiquidity premium given the highly structured nature of certain assets. The use of a higher or lower illiquidity premium would have caused significant decreases or increases, respectively, in the fair value of the asset. Embedded derivatives within our investment and universal life contracts liability can be in either an asset or liability position, depending on certain inputs at the reporting date. Increases to an asset or decreases to a liability are described as increases to fair value. The use of a higher or lower market volatility would have caused significant decreases or increases, respectively, in the fair value of embedded derivatives in investment and universal life contracts. Long duration interest rates are used as the mean return when projecting the growth in the value of associated account value and impact the discount rate used in the discounted future cash flows valuation. The use of higher or lower risk-free rates would have caused the fair value of the embedded derivative to significantly increase or decrease, respectively. The use of a higher or lower rate for our own credit risks, which impact the rates used to discount future cash flows, would have significantly increased or decreased, respectively, the fair value of the embedded derivative. The use of a lower or higher mortality rate assumption would have caused the fair value of the embedded derivative to decrease or increase, respectively.

 Retirement and Income Solutions Retirement and Income Solutions offers service and trust agreements for defined contribution retirement plans, including 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and employee stock ownership plans. The investment components of these service agreements are in the form of mutual fund offerings. In addition, plan sponsor retirement plan trust and custody services are also available through our trust company. Individual retirement accounts IRAs are offered through Principal Bank. Furthermore, services and trust agreements are offered to non-retirement customers including insurance companies, endowments and other financial institutions. Administrative service fee revenues are earned for administrative activities performed for the defined contribution retirement plans including recordkeeping and reporting as well as trust and custody, asset management and investment services. Administrative service fee revenues are earned for administrative activities performed for non-retirement plan customers including trust and custody services, defined benefit administration and investment management activities. The majority of these activities are performed daily over time. Fee-for-service transactions are also provided upon client request. These services are considered distinct or grouped into a bundle until a distinct performance obligation is identified. Some performance obligations are considered a series of distinct services, which are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.

Fees are based largely upon contractual rates applied to the specified amounts of the clients portfolios. Each service is a distinct performance obligation; however, if the services are not distinct on their own, we combine them into a distinct bundle or we have a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Fees and other revenues received for performance obligations such as asset management and other services are typically recognized over time utilizing the output method as the service is performed. Performance fees and transaction fees on certain accounts are recognized in income when the probability of significant reversal will not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty, which could be based on a variety of factors such as market performance or other internal metrics. Asset management fees are accrued each month based on the fee terms within the applicable agreement and are generally billed quarterly when values used for the calculation are available. Management fees and performance fees are variable consideration as they are subject to fluctuation based on assets under management AUM and other constraints. These fees are not recognized until unconstrained at the end of each reporting period. Incentive-based fees are recognized in income when the probability of significant reversal will not occur upon the resolution of the uncertainty, which is based on market performance.

The transaction price corresponds with the performance completed to date, for which the value is recognized as revenue during the period. Variability of consideration is resolved at the end of each period and payments are due when billed. Commission income is earned through sponsored brokerage services.

PSI enters into selling and distribution agreements with the obligation to sell or distribute the securities products, such as mutual funds, annuities and products sold through RIAs, to individual clients in return for front-end sales charges, 12b-1 service fees, annuity fees and asset-based fees. Front-end sales charges, 12b-1 fees and annuity fees are related to a single sale and are earned at the time of sale. PSI also enters into agreements with individual customers to provide securities trade execution and custody through a brokerage services platform in return for ticket charge and other service fee revenue. These services are bundled as one single distinct service referred to as brokerage services. This revenue is related to distinct transactions and is earned at a point in time. PSI also enters into agreements with individual customers to provide trade execution, clearing services, custody services and investment research services through our proprietary offered fee-based products. These services are bundled as one single distinct service referred to as advisory services. In addition, for outside RIA business PSI performs sales and distribution services only. The revenues are earned over time as the service is performed utilizing the output method. A majority of our revenue is based upon contractual rates applied to the market value of the clients portfolios and considered variable consideration.

The contract cost asset, which is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial position, was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We apply the practical expedient for certain costs where we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining these contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is year or less. These costs, along with costs that are not deferrable, are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Deferred contract costs consist primarily of commissions and variable compensation. We amortize capitalized contract costs on a straight-line basis over the expected contract life, reflecting lapses as they are incurred. Deferred contract costs are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or when a triggering event occurs that could warrant an impairment. To the extent future revenues less future maintenance expenses are not adequate to cover the asset balance, an impairment is recognized. Amortization expense of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was recorded in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and impairment loss was recognized in relation to the costs capitalized. new grants will be made under the 2020 Directors Stock Plan, the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2014 Directors Stock Plan, the Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2005 Directors Stock Plan, the Stock Incentive Plan or the Directors Stock Plan. Under the terms of the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan, grants may be nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units or other stock-based awards. To date, we have not granted any incentive stock options, restricted stock or performance units under any plans. As part of our fair value process, we assess the impact of material nonpublic information on our share price or expected volatility, as applicable, at the time of grant. No awards in 2024 required a fair value adjustment. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum number of new shares of common stock available for grant under the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan was million.

All outstanding nonqualified stock options are vested and have been fully expensed. Performance Share Awards Performance share awards were granted to certain employees under the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan. Total performance share awards granted were million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The performance share awards granted represent initial target awards and do not reflect potential increases or decreases resulting from the final performance results to be determined at the end of the performance period. The performance share awards include a relative total shareholder return modifier under which the number of shares ultimately awarded is also impacted by our actual shareholder return relative to our S P 500 Financial Sector Index peer group. The actual number of common shares to be awarded at the end of each performance period will range between and of the initial target awards. The fair value of performance share awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The weighted-average grant date fair value of these performance share awards granted was per common share. As of September 30, 2024, we had million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested performance share awards granted. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average service period of approximately years. Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock units were issued to certain employees and non-employee directors pursuant to the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan. Total restricted stock units granted were million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing stock price of our common shares on the grant date. The weighted-average grant date fair value of these restricted stock units granted was per common share. As of September 30, 2024, we had million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock unit awards granted.

Corporate, which manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate segment primarily reflect our financing activities (including financing costs), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and other adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items. Results of PSI, our retail broker-dealer and RIA, and our exited group medical and long-term care insurance businesses are reported in this segment. 
 Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations Yearly Renewable Term Reinsurance Transactions During the second quarter of 2024, we terminated, executed and amended certain YRT reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies for insurance risks associated with universal life insurance in the Benefits and Protection segment, primarily related to ULSG YRT Reinsurance Transactions ). Actuarial Assumption Updates We periodically review and update actuarial assumptions that are inputs to the models for the liability for future policy benefits for traditional limited-payment long-duration contracts and other actuarial balances. Assumption updates, model refinements and other updates made during the third quarter resulted in a change in cash flow assumptions that decreased consolidated net income attributable to Principal Financial Group, Inc. by 85.7 million and 9.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

In years when foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar, translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in fewer U.S. dollars to be reported. When foreign currencies strengthen, translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars results in more U.S. dollars to be reported. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations create variances in our financial statement line items. The most significant impact occurs within our Principal International operations where pre-tax operating earnings were negatively impacted 7.5 million and 14.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. This impact was calculated by comparing (a) the difference between current year results and prior year results to (b) the difference between current year results and prior year results translated using current year exchange rates for both periods. We use this approach to calculate the impact of exchange rates on all revenue and expense line items. For a discussion of our approaches to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk. Variable Investment Income Variable investment income includes certain types of investment returns such as prepayment fees and income (loss) from certain elements of our other alternative asset classes, including results of value-add real estate sales activity. Due to its unpredictable nature, variable investment income may or may not be material to our financial results for a given reporting period and may create variances when comparing different reporting periods.

The single premium group annuity product, which is typically used to fund defined benefit plan terminations, can generate large premiums from very few customers and therefore premiums tend to vary from period to period. This decrease was partially offset by a 41.7 million increase for the Benefits and Protection segment primarily due to growth in our Specialty Benefits business. Fees and other revenues increased 33.4 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to an increase in fee revenue stemming from an increase in average monthly account values, which largely resulted from more favorable financial markets.

 For net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses) variance information, see Investments Investment Results under the captions Net Investment Income and Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses), respectively. Net realized capital gains on funds withheld assets increased due to higher net gains on sales of funds withheld assets as a result of higher sales in third quarter 2024 resulting from additional portfolio re-positioning by an external reinsurer. The change in fair value of the funds withheld embedded derivative resulted in a loss in third quarter of 2024 due primarily to a decrease in interest rates as compared to a gain in third quarter of 2023 due primarily to an increase in interest rates. Total Expenses Benefits, claims and settlement expenses increased for the Benefits and Protection segment primarily due to a 30.7 million increase from negative claims experience in our Specialty Benefits business and a 27.3 million increase from growth in our Specialty Benefits business. The liability for future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss change was primarily due to the unfavorable effect of changes in cash flow assumptions related to actuarial assumption updates and model refinements. The market risk benefit remeasurement loss increased primarily due to a 140.1 million unfavorable impact from the change in fair value of the MRB asset (liability), excluding impacts of nonperformance risk, primarily driven by changes in market movements. This change was partially offset by a 104.7 million favorable impact from periodic and final settlements for derivatives used to hedge MRBs. Operating expenses increased primarily due to an increase in compensation costs. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate increased to 34 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 22 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income with no proportionate change in permanent tax differences.

Fees and other revenues increased 84.5 million for the Retirement and Income Solutions segment primarily due to an increase in fee revenue stemming from an increase in average monthly account values, which largely resulted from more favorable financial markets. Fees and other revenues increased for the Principal Asset Management segment due to 49.4 million higher management fee revenue as a result of increased average AUM managed by our Principal Global Investors operations, which was partially offset by 20.3 million lower performance fee revenue for our Principal Global Investors operations primarily in our real estate business. Fees and other revenues increased 19.5 million for the Benefits and Protection segment primarily due to growth in our Life Insurance business.

Results of Operations by Segment For results of operations by segment see Item 1. Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16, Segment Information. Retirement and Income Solutions Segment Retirement and Income Solutions Segment Summary Financial Data Net revenue and average monthly account values are key metrics used to understand Retirement and Income Solutions earnings growth. Net revenue, which is used only at the segment level, is defined as operating revenues less benefits, claims and settlement expenses; liability for future policy benefits remeasurement (gain) loss; market risk benefit remeasurement (gain) loss and dividends to policyholders. Net revenue is impacted by: (1) changes in the equity markets and interest rates and (2) the difference between investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate credited to the contracts. Average monthly account values include the net balances that customers have accumulated within their account, along with future policy benefits for retirement payout products. Average monthly account values are primarily impacted by net customer cash flows and credit market performance.

Principal Asset Management Segment Principal Global Investors AUM AUM is the base by which we generate management fee revenues. Market performance and net cash flow are the two main drivers of AUM growth. Market performance reflects equity, fixed income, real estate and other alternative investment performance. Net cash flow reflects client deposits and withdrawals. The fee levels on these client deposits and withdrawals are increasingly becoming the more important factor to revenue growth and will vary widely based on business and/or product mix. The following table presents the AUM rollforward for assets managed by Principal Global Investors for the periods indicated. The amounts include assets managed by Principal Global Investors on behalf of Principal International, which are also reported in the Principal International AUM table below.

 Principal International AUM AUM is generally a key indicator of earnings growth for Principal International, as AUM is the base by which we can generate local currency profits. The Cuprum business in Chile differs in that the majority of fees are collected with each deposit by the mandatory retirement customers, based on a capped salary level, as opposed to asset levels. Net customer cash flow and market performance are the two main drivers of local currency AUM growth. Net customer cash flow reflects our ability to attract and retain client deposits. Market performance reflects the investment returns on our underlying AUM. Our financial results are also impacted by fluctuations of the foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates for the locations in which we have business. AUM of our foreign subsidiaries is translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at the end of the reporting period using the spot foreign exchange rates. Revenue and expenses for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at the average foreign exchange rates for the reporting period. The following table presents the Principal International AUM rollforward for the periods indicated.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and capital resources represent the overall strength of a company and its ability to generate strong cash flows, borrow funds at a competitive rate and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs. We are monitoring our liquidity closely and feel confident in our ability to meet all long-term obligations to customers, policyholders and debt holders. Our sources of strength include our laddered long-term debt maturities with the next maturity occurring in 2025, access to revolving credit facility and contingent funding arrangements, a strong risk-based capital position and our available cash and liquid assets. Our legal entity structure has an impact on our ability to meet cash flow needs as an organization. Following is a simplified organizational structure. Liquidity Our liquidity requirements have been and will continue to be met by funds from consolidated operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from credit facilities. We believe the cash flows from these sources are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of our operations, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies. We maintain a level of cash and securities which, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, we believe to be adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term payment obligations. We will continue our prudent capital management practice of regularly exploring options available to us to maximize capital flexibility, including accessing the capital markets and careful attention to and management of expenses. We perform rigorous liquidity stress testing to ensure our asset portfolio includes sufficient high quality liquid assets that could be utilized to bolster our liquidity position under increasingly stressed market conditions. These assets could be utilized as collateral for secured borrowing transactions with various third parties or by selling the securities in the open market if needed. We also manage liquidity risk by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other options that can be exercised at inopportune times. For example, as of September 30, 2024, approximately 15.0 billion, or 99 , of our institutional guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements cannot be redeemed by contractholders prior to maturity. Our individual annuity liabilities also contain surrender charges and other provisions limiting early surrenders.

However, life insurance policies tend to be less susceptible to withdrawal than our investment contracts because policyholders may be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new life insurance policy. In addition, our life insurance liabilities include surrender charges to discourage early surrenders. We had the following short-term credit financing structures available with various financial institutions as of September 30, 2024: 

Amount Obligor/Applicant Financing structure Maturity Capacity outstanding (3) (in millions) Principal Life (1) Credit facility October 2027 800.0 Principal International Chile (2) Unsecured lines of credit 109.1 37.3 Total 909.1 37.3 

 (1) The credit facility is supported by sixteen banks. (2) The unsecured lines of credit can be used for repurchase agreements or other borrowings. Each line has a maturity of less than one year. (3) The amount outstanding is reported in short-term debt on the consolidated statements of financial position. 
 The revolving credit facility is committed and available for general corporate purposes. The credit facility also provides 100 back-stop support for our commercial paper program, of which we had no outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Most of the banks supporting the credit facility have other relationships with us. Due to the financial strength and the strong relationships we have with these providers, we are comfortable we have very low risk the financial institutions would be unable or unwilling to fund this facility. The Holding Companies: PFG and PFS. The principal sources of funds available to our parent holding company, PFG, are dividends from subsidiaries as well as its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise capital to meet operating and growth needs. These funds are used by PFG to meet its obligations, which include the payment of dividends on common stock, debt service and the repurchase of stock. The declaration and payment of common stock dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board and will depend on our overall financial condition, results of operations, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, receipt of dividends or other distributions from Principal Life (as described below), risk management considerations and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. No significant restrictions limit the payment of dividends by PFG, except those generally applicable to corporations incorporated in Delaware.

 Dividends or other distributions from Principal Life, our primary subsidiary, are limited by Iowa law. Under Iowa law, Principal Life may pay dividends or make other distributions only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Iowa (the Commissioner to pay stockholder dividends or make any other distribution if such distribution would exceed certain statutory limitations. Iowa law gives the Commissioner discretion to disapprove requests for distributions in excess of these limitations. Extraordinary dividends include those made, together with dividends and other distributions, within the preceding twelve months that exceed the greater of (i) 10 of statutory policyholder surplus as of the previous year-end excluding admitted disallowed interest maintenance reserve or (ii) the statutory net gain from operations from the previous calendar year, not to exceed earned surplus. Based on statutory results for the year ended December 31, 2023, the ordinary stockholder dividend limitation for Principal Life is approximately 1,497.8 million in 2024. However, because the dividend test is based on dividends previously paid over rolling twelve month periods, if paid before a specified date during 2024, some or all of such dividends may be extraordinary and require regulatory approval. Total stockholder dividends paid by Principal Life to its parent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 885.0 million, all of which was extraordinary and approved by the Commissioner. As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,337.5 million of cash and liquid assets held in our holding companies and other subsidiaries, which is available for corporate purposes. Corporate balances held in foreign holding companies meet the indefinite reinvestment exception. Operations. Our primary consolidated cash flow sources are premiums from insurance products, pension and annuity deposits, asset management fee revenues, administrative services fee revenues, income from investments and proceeds from the sales or maturity of investments. Cash outflows consist primarily of payment of benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries, income and other taxes, current operating expenses, payment of dividends to policyholders, payments in connection with investments acquired, payments made to acquire subsidiaries, payments relating to policy and contract surrenders, withdrawals, policy loans, interest payments and repayment of short-term debt and long-term debt. Our investment strategies are generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments. For a discussion of our investment objectives and strategies, see Investments. Cash Flows. Cash flow activity, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, provides relevant information regarding our sources and uses of cash. The following discussion of our operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows excludes cash flows attributable to the separate accounts. Net cash provided by operating activities was 3,143.9 million and 2,848.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our insurance business typically generates positive cash flows from operating activities, as premiums collected from our insurance products and investment income received exceed acquisition costs, benefits paid, redemptions and operating expenses. These positive cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance and investment products and required capital supporting these products. Our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees and investment income received and benefits and expenses paid. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a one-time impact of the YRT Reinsurance Transactions in 2024. Net cash used in investing activities was 1,628.6 million and 1,131.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to higher net purchases of available-for-sale securities in 2024 as compared to 2023. Net cash used in financing activities was 48.5 million and 2,000.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was due to an increase in banking operation deposits in 2024 as compared to a decrease in 2023 and net investment contract deposits in 2024 as compared to net investment contract withdrawals in 2023. These were partially offset by higher acquisitions of treasury stock in 2024 as compared to 2023.

Financial Strength and Credit Ratings Our ratings are influenced by the relative ratings of our peers/competitors as well as many other factors including our operating and financial performance, capital levels, asset quality, liquidity, asset/liability management, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), risk exposures, operating leverage and other factors. We have had no significant changes or actions in ratings and rating outlooks that have occurred from January 1, 2024, through the date of this filing. The following table summarizes our significant financial strength and debt ratings from the major independent rating organizations. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Such a rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority (Level 3) to unobservable inputs. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety considering factors specific to the asset or liability. See Item 1. Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15, Fair Value Measurements for further details, including a reconciliation of changes in Level 3 fair value measurements. As of September 30, 2024, 47 of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 50 were Level 2 and 3 were Level 3. Excluding separate account assets as of September 30, 2024, 3 of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 89 were Level 2 and 8 were Level 3. As of December 31, 2023, 46 of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 51 were Level 2 and 3 were Level 3. Excluding separate account assets as of December 31, 2023, 3 of our net assets (liabilities) were Level 1, 88 were Level 2 and 9 were Level 3.

 Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Measurements Net assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of September 30, 2024, were 7,022.2 million as compared to 7,447.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the funds withheld payable embedded derivative net asset. Investments We had total consolidated assets as of September 30, 2024, of 322,857.7 million, of which 102,647.7 million were invested assets. A portion of our invested assets represent funds withheld backing reserves as part of coinsurance with funds withheld reinsurance agreements. The funds withheld assets and associated net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses) are not included in the discussions below as the investment risk is passed to the reinsurer. See Item 1. Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10, Reinsurance for more information on the funds withheld assets. The rest of our total consolidated assets are comprised primarily of separate account assets for which we do not bear investment risk; therefore, the discussion and financial information below does not include such assets. Overall Composition of Invested Assets Invested assets as of September 30, 2024, were predominantly high quality and broadly diversified across asset class, individual credit, industry and geographic location. Asset allocation is determined based on cash flow and the risk/return requirements of our products. As shown in the following table, the major categories of invested assets are fixed maturities and mortgage loans.

These increases were partially offset by lower income on derivatives associated with fair value hedges in our U.S. operations. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net investment income increased primarily due to higher yields and average invested assets in fixed maturities and cash in our U.S. operations.

(2) Net realized capital gains (losses) can be volatile due to credit losses from invested assets, mark-to-market adjustments of certain invested assets and our decision to sell invested assets. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net realized capital gains decreased primarily due to losses versus gains on non-hedged interest rate derivatives due to changes in rates, increased losses on commercial mortgage loan reserve changes and decreased gains on equity real estate. These decreases were partially offset by gains versus losses on currency derivatives due to changes in rates and gains versus losses from noncredit available-for-sale fixed maturities. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net realized capital gains increased primarily due to gains versus losses on currency derivatives due to changes in rates and decreased losses from noncredit available-for-sale fixed maturities. These increases were partially offset by increased losses on commercial mortgage loans reserve changes, decreased gains on equity real estate sales and decreased gains on non-hedged interest rate derivatives due to changes in rates. U.S. Investment Operations In the following sections, we provide details about U.S. Investment Operations, excluding investments held as part of coinsurance with funds withheld agreements. We believe the details of the composition of our investment portfolio excluding the funds withheld are most relevant to an understanding of our operations that are pertinent to investors because all funds withheld assets support obligations and liabilities relating to reinsurance transactions. Guidelines are in place to ensure the investment risk associated with these fund withheld assets are appropriately managed. See Footnote 10, Reinsurance, for further information on the funds withheld assets.

 Of our invested assets, 77,830.2 million were held by our U.S. operations as of September 30, 2024. Our U.S. invested assets are managed primarily by Principal Global Investors. Our Investment Committee, appointed by our Board, is responsible for establishing investment policies and monitoring risk limits and tolerances. Our primary investment objective is to maximize after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters. We seek to protect customers benefits by optimizing the risk/return relationship on an ongoing basis, through asset/liability matching, reducing credit risk, avoiding high levels of investments that may be redeemed by the issuer, maintaining sufficiently liquid investments and avoiding undue asset concentrations through diversification. We are exposed to two primary sources of investment risk: credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of an obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest and interest rate risk, relating to the market price and/or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves. 
 Our ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability. We devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment. We manage credit risk through industry, issuer and asset class diversification. A dedicated committee, comprised of senior investment professional staff members, approves the credit rating for the fixed maturities we purchase. We have teams of security analysts, organized by industry and asset class, that analyze and monitor these investments. Investments held in the portfolio are monitored on a continuous basis with a formal review annually or more frequently if material events affect the issuer. The analysis includes both fundamental and technical factors. The fundamental analysis encompasses both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the issuer. The qualitative analysis includes an assessment of both accounting and management aggressiveness of the issuer. In addition, technical indicators such as stock price volatility and credit default swap levels are monitored. We regularly review our investments to determine whether we should re-rate them, employing the following criteria: material changes in the issuer s revenues, margins, capital structure or collateral values; significant management or organizational changes; significant changes regarding the issuer s industry; debt service coverage or cash flow ratios that fall below industry-specific thresholds; violation of financial covenants and other business factors that relate to the issuer. 
 We purchase credit default swaps to hedge certain credit exposures in our investment portfolio. We economically hedged credit exposure in our portfolio by purchasing credit default swaps with a notional amount of 105.0 million and 85.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We sell credit default swaps and total return swaps to offer credit protection to investors when entering into synthetic replicating transactions. When selling credit protection, if there is an event of default by the referenced name, we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced security. When selling total return swaps, if there is an event of default by the referenced name, we are obligated to compensate the protection buyer for any decline in the price of the referenced security. For further information on credit derivatives sold, see Item 1. Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4, Derivative Financial Instruments under the caption, Credit Derivatives Sold. Our use of derivatives exposes us to counterparty risk, or the risk that the counterparty fails to perform the terms of the derivative contract. We actively manage this risk by: obtaining approval of all new counterparties by the Investment Committee; establishing exposure limits that take into account non-derivative exposure we have with the counterparty as well as derivative exposure; performing similar credit analysis prior to approval on each derivatives counterparty that we do when lending money on a long-term basis; diversifying our risk across numerous approved counterparties; implementing credit support annex (collateral) agreements CSAs for over-the-counter derivative transactions or similar agreements with a majority of our counterparties to further limit counterparty exposures, which provide for netting of exposures; limiting exposure to A credit or better for over-the-counter derivative counterparties without CSAs; conducting stress-test analysis to determine the maximum exposure created during the life of a prospective transaction; daily monitoring of counterparty credit ratings, exposures and associated collateral levels and trading mandatorily cleared contracts through centralized clearinghouses.

 We manage our exposure on a net basis, whereby we net positive and negative exposures for each counterparty with agreements in place. For further information on derivative exposure, see Item 1. Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3, Investments under the caption, Balance Sheet Offsetting. A dedicated risk management team is responsible for centralized monitoring of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio. We apply a variety of guidelines to minimize credit risk in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. When considering new commercial mortgage loans, we review the cash flow fundamentals of the property, make a physical assessment of the underlying commercial real estate, conduct a comprehensive market analysis and compare against industry lending practices. We use a proprietary risk rating model to evaluate all new and substantially all existing loans within the portfolio. The proprietary risk model is designed to stress projected cash flows under simulated economic and market downturns. Our lending guidelines are typically 75 or less loan-to-value ratio and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 times. We analyze investments outside of these guidelines based on cash flow quality, tenancy and other factors. The following table presents loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios for our brick and mortar commercial mortgage loans: 

Weighted average loan-to-value ratio Debt service coverage ratio September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 New mortgages 54 50 1.6 x 1.4 x Entire mortgage portfolio 50 49 2.4 x 2.5 x We also seek to manage call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates. We assess and price for call or prepayment risks in all of our investments and monitor these risks in accordance with asset/liability management policies. The amortized cost and weighted average yield, calculated using amortized cost, of non-structured fixed maturity securities that will be callable at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were 2,193.6 million and 4.1 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and 2,159.0 million and 4.0 , respectively, as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the amortized cost and weighted average yield of RMBS, residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and asset-backed securities - home equity with material prepayment risk were 8,011.0 million and 4.1 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and 6,959.0 million and 3.7 , respectively, as of December 31, 2023. Our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each primary business operation. In addition, we diversify our product portfolio offerings to include products that contain features that will protect us against fluctuations in interest rates. Those features include adjustable crediting rates, policy surrender charges and market value adjustments on liquidations. For further information on our management of interest rate risk, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. Overall Composition of U.S. Invested Assets As shown in the following table, the major categories of U.S. invested assets are fixed maturities and mortgage loans.

Our portfolio is comprised of Government National Mortgage Association, Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation pass-through securities. In addition, our residential collateralized mortgage obligation portfolio offers structural features that allow cash flows to be matched to our liabilities. We purchase CMBS to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturities portfolio and to provide attractive returns. The primary risks in holding CMBS are structural and credit risks. Structural risks include the security s priority in the issuer s capital structure, the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments. Credit risks involve collateral and issuer/servicer risk where collateral and servicer performance may deteriorate. CMBS are predominantly comprised of large pool securitizations that are diverse by property type, borrower and geographic dispersion. The risks to any CMBS deal are determined by the credit quality of the underlying loans and how those loans perform over time. Another key risk is the vintage of the underlying loans and the state of the markets during a particular vintage. Similar to CMBS, we purchase ABS for diversification and to provide attractive returns. The primary risks in holding ABS are also structural and credit risks, which are similar to those noted above for CMBS. Our ABS portfolio is diversified by type of asset, issuer, and vintage. We actively monitor holdings of ABS to recognize adverse changes in the risk profile of each security. Prepayments in the ABS portfolio are, in general, insensitive to changes in interest rates or are insulated from such changes by call protection features. In the event we are subject to prepayment risk, we monitor the factors that impact the level of prepayment and prepayment speed for those ABS. In addition, we hold a diverse class of securities, which limits our exposure to any one security. The international exposure held in our U.S. operation s fixed maturities portfolio was 15 of total fixed maturities as of September 30, 2024, and 14 as of December 31, 2023. It is comprised of corporate and foreign government fixed maturities.

 International fixed maturities exposure is determined by the country of risk of the obligor entity. All international fixed maturities held by our U.S. operations are either denominated in U.S. dollars or have been swapped into U.S. dollar equivalents. Our international investments are analyzed internally by country and industry credit investment professionals. We control concentrations using issuer and country level exposure benchmarks, which are based on the credit quality of the issuer and the country. Our investment policy limits total international fixed maturities investments and we are within those internal limits. Exposure to Canada is not included in our international exposure. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investments in Canada totaled 1,020.1 million and 958.0 million, respectively. Fixed Maturities Credit Concentrations. One aspect of managing credit risk is through industry, issuer and asset class diversification. Our credit concentrations are managed to established limits. The top 10 exposures comprised 5.3 of single-name credit fixed maturity exposures as of September 30, 2024, and 4.8 as of December 31, 2023. Fixed Maturities Valuation and Credit Quality. Valuation techniques for the fixed maturities portfolio vary by security type and the availability of market data. The use of different pricing techniques and their assumptions could produce different financial results. See Item 1. Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15, Fair Value Measurements for further details regarding our pricing methodology. Once prices are determined, they are reviewed by pricing analysts for reasonableness based on asset class and observable market data. Investment analysts who are familiar with specific securities review prices for reasonableness through direct interaction with external sources, review of recent trade activity or use of internal models. All fixed maturities placed on the watch list are periodically analyzed by investment analysts. These analysts periodically meet with the Chief Investment Officer and the Portfolio Managers to determine reasonableness of the analysts prices. The valuation of bonds for which a credit loss exists and there is no quoted price is typically based on relative value analysis and the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received. Although we believe these values reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities, the key assumptions about risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any) and other market factors involve qualitative and unobservable inputs. The Securities Valuation Office SVO of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC monitors the bond investments of insurers for regulatory capital and reporting purposes and, when required, assigns securities to one of six categories referred to as NAIC designations. Although NAIC designations are not produced to aid the investment decision making process, NAIC designations may serve as a reasonable proxy for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations NRSRO credit ratings for certain bonds. For most corporate bonds, NAIC designations 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered investment grade by such rating organizations. Bonds are considered investment grade when rated Baa3 or higher by Moody s, or BBB- or higher by S P. NAIC designations 3 through 6 include bonds generally referred to as below investment grade. Bonds are considered below investment grade when rated Ba1 or lower by Moody s, or BB+ or lower by S P. For loan-backed and structured securities, as defined by the NAIC, the NAIC designation is not always a reasonable indication of an NRSRO rating as described below. For CMBS and non-agency RMBS, Blackrock Solutions undertakes the modeling of those NAIC designations. This may result in a final designation being higher or lower than the NRSRO credit rating. The following table presents our total fixed maturities by NAIC designation as of the periods indicated as well as the percentage, based on fair value, that each designation comprises.

 Fixed maturities included 49 securities with an amortized cost of 538.2 million, gross gains of 10.1 million, gross losses of 31.5 million, valuation allowance of 0.0 million and a carrying amount of 516.8 million as of September 30, 2024, that were still pending a review and assignment of a designation by the SVO or NRSRO ratings to be assigned. Due to the timing of when fixed maturities are purchased, legal documents are filed and the review by the SVO is completed, or NRSRO ratings that have expired or been withdrawn, we will always have securities in our portfolio that are unrated over a reporting period. In these instances, an equivalent designation is assigned based on our fixed income analyst s assessment. Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities. As of September 30, 2024, based on amortized cost, 96 of our CMBS portfolio had an NAIC designation of 1. The following table presents our exposure by credit quality based on NAIC designations for our CMBS portfolio as of the periods indicated.

Fixed Maturities Watch List. We monitor any decline in the credit quality of fixed maturities through the designation of problem securities, potential problem securities and restructured securities . We define problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities: (i) with principal and/or interest payments in default or where default is perceived to be imminent in the near term, or (ii) issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities. We define potential problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities included on an internal watch list for which management has concerns as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt payment terms and which may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured. The decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by our management as to the likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer. We define restructured securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities where a concession has been granted to the borrower related to the borrower s financial difficulties that would not have otherwise been considered. We determine that restructures should occur in those instances where greater economic value will be realized under the new terms than through liquidation or other disposition and may involve a change in contractual cash flows. If the present value of the restructured cash flows is less than the current cost of the asset being restructured, a realized capital loss is recorded in net income and a new cost basis is established. The following table presents the total carrying amount of our fixed maturities portfolio, as well as its problem, potential problem and restructured fixed maturities for the periods indicated.

 Fixed Maturities Credit Losses. Each reporting period, a group of individuals including the Chief Investment Officer, our Portfolio Managers, the assigned analysts and representatives from Investment Accounting review all securities to determine whether a credit loss exists. The analysis focuses on each issuer s ability to service its debts in a timely fashion. Formal documentation of the analysis and our decision is prepared and approved by management. For additional details regarding our process to identify and evaluate securities with credit losses, see Item 1. Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3, Investments under the caption Allowance for Credit Loss. We would not consider a security with unrealized losses to have a decline in value due to credit when it is not our intent to sell the security, it is not more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost, which may be maturity, and we expect to recover the amortized cost basis. However, we do sell securities under certain circumstances, such as when we have evidence of a change in the issuer s creditworthiness, when we anticipate poor relative future performance of securities, when a change in regulatory requirements modifies what constitutes a permissible investment or the maximum level of investments held or when there is an increase in capital requirements or a change in risk weights of debt securities. Sales generate both gains and losses. A number of significant risks and uncertainties are inherent in the process of monitoring credit losses and determining the allowance for credit loss. These risks and uncertainties include: (1) the risk that our assessment of an issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer, (2) the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated, (3) the risk that our investment professionals are making decisions based on fraudulent or misstated information in the financial statements provided by issuers and (4) the risk that new information obtained by us or changes in other facts and circumstances lead us to change our intent to not sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost. Any of these situations could result in a charge to net income in a future period. The net realized loss relating to the change in the allowance for credit loss and credit related sales of fixed maturities was 2.8 million and 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 11.5 million and 42.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Of the 3,170.6 million in gross unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024, 7.0 million in losses were attributed to securities scheduled to mature in one year or less, 158.8 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between one to five years, 450.7 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature between five to ten years, 1,716.4 million attributed to securities scheduled to mature after ten years and 837.7 million related to mortgage-backed and other ABS that are not classified by maturity year. As of September 30, 2024, we were in a 2,338.6 million net unrealized loss position as compared to a 3,542.9 million net unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023. The 1,204.3 million decrease in net unrealized loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, can be attributed to tightening of credit spreads and a decrease in interest rates. Fixed Maturities Available-For-Sale Unrealized Losses. We believe our long-term fixed maturities portfolio is well diversified among industry types and between publicly traded and privately placed securities. Each year, we direct the majority of our net cash inflows into investment grade fixed maturities. Our current policy is to limit the percentage of fixed maturities invested in below investment grade assets to 15 .

 We invest in privately placed fixed maturities to enhance the overall value of the portfolio, increase diversification and obtain higher yields than are possible with comparable quality public market securities. Generally, private placements provide broader access to management information, strengthened negotiated protective covenants, call protection features and, where applicable, a higher level of collateral. They are, however, generally not freely tradable because of restrictions imposed by U.S. federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets. The following table presents our fixed maturities available-for-sale by investment grade and below investment grade as of the periods indicated.

 Mortgage Loans Mortgage loans consist of commercial mortgage loans on real estate and residential mortgage loans. For further details about residential mortgage loans, see Item 1. Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3, Investments under the caption, Financing Receivables. Commercial Mortgage Loans. We generally report commercial mortgage loans on real estate at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. Commercial mortgage loans play an important role in our investment strategy by: providing strong risk-adjusted relative value in comparison to other investment alternatives; enhancing total returns and providing strategic portfolio diversification. 
 As a result, we have focused on constructing a high quality portfolio of mortgages. Our portfolio is generally comprised of mortgages originated with conservative loan-to-value ratios, high debt service coverages and general purpose property types with a strong credit tenancy. Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of non-recourse, fixed rate mortgages on fully or near fully leased properties. The mortgage portfolio is comprised primarily of office properties, apartments, well anchored retail properties and general-purpose industrial properties.

 Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is diversified by geography and specific collateral property type. Commercial mortgage lending in the state of California accounted for 24 and 25 of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio before valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We are, therefore, exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, that may affect the region. Like other lenders, we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make commercial mortgage loans. With respect to California properties, however, we obtain an engineering report specific to each property. The report assesses the building s design specifications, whether it has been upgraded to meet seismic building codes and the maximum loss that is likely to result from a variety of different seismic events. We also obtain a report that assesses, by building and geographic fault lines, the amount of loss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio might suffer under a variety of seismic events. The typical borrower in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is a single purpose entity or single asset entity. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding were 607 and 596, of which 37 and 38 were for loans with principal balances less than 10.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average loan size of our commercial mortgage portfolio was 22.8 million and 22.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Commercial Mortgage Loan Credit Monitoring. For further details on monitoring and management of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, see Item 1. Financial Statements, Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3, Investments under the caption, Financing Receivables Credit Monitoring. We categorize loans that are 60 days or more delinquent, loans in process of foreclosure and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are delinquent as problem loans. We categorize loans that are delinquent less than 60 days where the default is expected to be cured and loans with borrowers or credit tenants in bankruptcy that are current as potential problem loans. The decision whether to classify a loan delinquent less than 60 days as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by management as to the likely future economic conditions and developments with respect to the borrower. We categorize loans for which the original note rate has been reduced below market and loans for which the principal has been reduced as restructured loans. We also consider loans that are refinanced more than one year beyond the original maturity or call date at below market rates as restructured. We had two delinquent problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of 7.5 million for which we had a valuation allowance of 7.5 million as of September 30, 2024. We also had three potential problem commercial mortgage loan with a carrying amount of 153.7 million for which we had a valuation allowance of 39.5 million and one restructured problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of 34.1 million for which we had a valuation allowance of 34.1 million as of September 30, 2024. We had one delinquent problem commercial mortgage loan with a carrying amount of 7.9 million for which we had a valuation allowance of 7.9 million as of December 31, 2023. We also had two potential problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of 95.4 million for which we had a valuation allowance of 11.9 million and two restructured problem commercial mortgage loans with a carrying amount of 92.7 million for which we had a valuation allowance of 34.1 million as of December 31, 2023.

 Real Estate Real estate consists primarily of commercial equity real estate. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of our equity real estate investment was 2,423.5 million and 2,343.4 million, respectively. Our commercial equity real estate is held in the form of wholly owned real estate, real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans and majority owned interests in real estate joint ventures. Equity real estate is categorized as either real estate held for investment or real estate held for sale. The carrying value of real estate held for investment is generally adjusted for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Such impairment adjustments are recorded as net realized capital losses in our consolidated results of operations. No such impairment adjustments were recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or for the year ended December 31, 2023. Once we identify a real estate property to be sold and it is probable that it will be sold, we classify the property as held for sale. We establish a valuation allowance subject to periodic revisions, if necessary, to adjust the carrying value of the property to reflect the lower of its current carrying value or the fair value, less associated selling costs. The valuation allowance did not change for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or for the year ended December 31, 2023. We use research, both internal and external, to recommend appropriate product and geographic allocations and changes to the equity real estate portfolio. We monitor product, geographic and industry diversification separately and together to determine the most appropriate mix. Equity real estate is distributed across geographic regions of the country. As of September 30, 2024, our largest equity real estate portfolio concentration was in the Pacific (47 region of the United States. By property type, our largest concentrations were in Industrial (33 and Office (31 as of September 30, 2024. Other Investments Our other investments totaled 4,581.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 4,121.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Other investments include interests in unconsolidated entities, which include real estate properties owned jointly with venture partners and operated by the partners; sponsored investment funds; the cash surrender value of company owned and trust owned life insurance; derivative assets and other investments. International Investment Operations Of our invested assets, 6,865.0 million were held by our Principal International operations as of September 30, 2024. The assets are primarily managed by the local Principal International affiliate. Due to the regulatory constraints in each location, each company maintains its own investment policies. As shown in the following table, the major category of international invested assets is fixed maturities. The following table excludes invested assets of the separate accounts.

 Regulations in certain locations require investment in the funds we manage. These required regulatory investments are classified as equity securities within our consolidated statements of financial position, with all mark-to-market changes reflected in net investment income. Our investment is primarily dictated by client activity and all investment performance is retained by us. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk Exposures and Risk Management Market risk is the risk we will incur losses due to adverse fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to interest rates, equity markets and foreign currency exchange rates. The active management of market risk is an integral part of our operations. We manage our overall market risk exposure within established risk tolerance ranges using several approaches, including: rebalancing our existing asset or liability portfolios; controlling the risk structure of newly acquired assets and liabilities and using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets or liabilities or assets expected to be purchased. 
 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk arises primarily from our holdings in interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Changes in interest rates impact numerous aspects of our operations, including but not limited to: yield on our invested assets; rate of interest we credit to contractholder account balances; timing of cash flows on assets and liabilities containing embedded prepayment options; cost of hedging our GMWB rider; discount rate used in valuing our liability for future policy benefits for long-duration insurance and annuity contracts; discount rate used in valuing our pension and OPEB obligations; statutory reserve and capital requirements; asset-based fees earned on the fixed income assets we manage; interest expense on our long-term borrowings; fair value of intangible assets in our reporting units and fair value of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position. 
 Lower interest rates generally result in lower profitability in the long-term. Conversely, higher interest rates generally result in higher profitability in the long-term. However, an increase in market interest rates may cause a decline in the value of financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position. Impact of Changes in Long-Term Interest Rate Assumptions We use long-term interest rate assumptions to calculate MRBs, certain reserves and benefit plan obligations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In setting these assumptions, we consider a variety of factors, including historical experience, emerging trends and future expectations. We evaluate our assumptions on at least an annual basis. Due to the long-term nature of our assumptions, we generally do not revise our assumptions in response to short-term fluctuations in market interest rates. However, we will consider revising our assumptions if a significant change occurs in the factors noted above. A reduction in our long-term interest rate assumptions may result in increases in MRB liabilities and certain reserves.

 Impact of Changes in Interest Rates Changes in interest rates or a sustained low interest rate environment may result in the following impacts, which would impact our financial position and results of operations: Impact of Falling Interest Rates or Sustained Low Interest Rates Impact of Rising Interest Rates Adverse Impacts: Positive Impacts: A reduction in investment income, which may be partially offset by a reduction in the interest we credit on contractholder account balances; however, our ability to lower crediting rates may be constrained by guaranteed minimum interest rates and competitive pressures An increase in investment income, which may be partially or fully offset by an increase in the interest we credit on contractholder account balances An increase in the cost of hedging our GMWB rider A decrease in the cost of hedging our GMWB rider An increase in MRB liabilities and certain reserves A decrease in MRB liabilities and certain reserves A reduction in the discount rate used to measure reserves for long-duration insurance and annuity contracts, leading to an increase in our reserves An increase in the discount rate used to measure reserves for long-duration insurance and annuity contracts, leading to a decrease in our reserves A reduction in the discount rate used in valuing our pension and OPEB obligations, leading to an increase in our Projected Benefit Obligation, Net Periodic Pension Cost, Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation and Net Periodic Benefit Cost An increase in the discount rate used in valuing our pension and OPEB obligations, leading to a decrease in our Projected Benefit Obligation, Net Periodic Pension Cost, Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation and Net Periodic Benefit Cost An increase in statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves A decrease in statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves An increase in prepayments or redemptions on mortgages and bonds we own, which would force us to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates A decrease in prepayments or redemptions on mortgages and bonds we own, which would reduce our opportunity to reinvest the proceeds at higher interest rates Positive Impacts: Adverse Impacts: An increase in the value of the fixed income assets we manage, resulting in an increase in our fee revenue in the short-term A decrease in the value of the fixed income assets we manage, resulting in a decrease in our fee revenue in the short-term A decrease in the interest expense on our long-term borrowings, to the extent the borrowings have adjustable rates or we are able to refinance our obligations at lower interest rates An increase in the interest expense on our long-term borrowings, to the extent the borrowings have adjustable rates or we refinance our obligations at higher interest rates An increase in the fair value of certain financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position A decrease in the fair value of certain financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position, as discussed below A reduction in the fair value of intangible assets in our reporting units, potentially leading to an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets We estimate a hypothetical 100 basis point immediate, parallel decrease in U.S. interest rates would impact segment pre-tax operating earnings between (1) and 1 over the next twelve months. This estimate reflects the impact of routine management actions in response to changes in interest rates, such as reducing the interest rates we credit on contractholder account balances, but does not reflect the impact of other actions management may consider, such as curtailing sales of certain products. The selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel decrease in U.S. interest rates should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the impact of such an event. Our exposure will change as a result of ongoing portfolio transactions in response to new business, management s assessment of changing market conditions and changes in our mix of business.

 If market rates increase rapidly, policy surrenders, withdrawals and requests for policy loans may increase as customers seek to achieve higher returns. Excess lapses may result in an acceleration of amortization for our DAC and other actuarial balances. We may be required to sell assets to raise the cash necessary to respond to such surrenders, withdrawals and loans, thereby realizing capital losses on the assets sold. Guaranteed Minimum Interest Rate Exposure . The following table provides detail on the differences between the interest rates being credited to contractholders as of September 30, 2024, and the respective GMIR. Amounts for contracts without significant fee revenues such as GICs, funding agreements, retail fixed income annuities and guaranteed pension contracts are excluded. Additionally, amounts for contracts that are reinsured are also excluded. Account values are broken down by GMIR level within the Retirement and Income Solutions and Benefits and Protection segments.

 Impact of Rising Interest Rates on the Fair Value of Financial Assets. An increase in market interest rates may cause a decline in the value of financial assets held at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position. Although changes in the fair value of our financial assets due to changes in interest rates may impact the amount of equity reported in our consolidated statements of financial position, these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments, terminate derivative positions, record an allowance for credit loss, or determine a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge. We estimate a hypothetical 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates would reduce the net reported fair value of our financial assets and derivatives by 2,821.6 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 2,670.3 million as of December 31, 2023. This estimate only reflects the change in fair value for financial assets and derivatives reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position. Assets and liabilities not reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial position including mortgage loans, liabilities relating to insurance contracts, investment contracts, debt and bank deposits are excluded from this sensitivity analysis. We believe the excluded liability items would economically serve as a partial offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis. Separate account assets and liabilities are also excluded from this estimate, as any interest rate risk is borne by the holder of the separate account. Assets backing reserves as part of a coinsurance with funds withheld agreement are excluded from this estimate, as any interest rate risk is passed to the reinsurer. For more information on fair value measurements, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18, Fair Value Measurements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Our selection of a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario we use to demonstrate potential risk. While a 100 basis point immediate, parallel increase does not represent our view of future market changes, it is a near term reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events. While this sensitivity analysis provides a representation of interest rate sensitivity, it is based on our portfolio exposures at a point in time and may not be representative of future market results. These exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio transactions in response to new business, management s assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities. Our net estimated potential loss in fair value as of September 30, 2024, increased 151.3 million from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by growth in the portfolio. Interest Rate Risk Management We manage interest rate risk through the use of an integrated risk management framework. This helps us identify, assess, monitor, report and manage our risks within established limits and risk tolerances. Our internal risk committees monitor and discuss our risk profile and identify necessary actions to mitigate impacts from interest rate risk. The product designs within our business units result in a variety of different interest rate risk profiles. Therefore, our business units use a variety of different approaches for managing their asset and liability interest rate risks. Retirement Business Stable Cash Flows For stable and predictable cash flow liabilities, such as pension risk transfer, WSRS, and investment only, we use investment strategy and hedges to tightly align the cash flow run off of these asset and liability cash flows. Immunization analysis is also utilized in the management of interest rate risk. U.S. Insurance Stable Cash Flows Our insurance businesses in many instances contain long-term guarantees with stable and predictable liability cash flows and recurring premiums. We manage the interest rate risk through investment strategy, product crediting rates and analyzing duration and embedded value sensitivity. Principal International Our international businesses operate within local regulations and financial market conditions (e.g., derivative markets, assets available) to achieve similar asset and liability cash flow management objectives. In locations with a limited availability of long-dated assets and derivative markets, the duration gap is managed to risk tolerances specific to each location. 
 We also limit our exposure to interest rate risk through our business mix and strategy. We have intentionally limited our exposure to specific products where investment margins are critical to the product s profitability, and we continue to emphasize the sale of products that generate revenues in the form of fees for service or premiums for insurance coverage and expose us to minimal interest rate risk. Prepayment risk is controlled by limiting our exposure to investments that are prepayable without penalty prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. We also require additional yield on these investments to compensate for the risk the issuer will exercise such option. Prepayment risk is also controlled by limiting the sales of liabilities with features such as puts or other options that can be exercised at inopportune times. We manage the interest rate risk associated with our long-term borrowings by monitoring the interest rate environment and evaluating refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach. The plan fiduciaries use a Dynamic Asset Allocation strategy for our qualified defined benefit pension plan, which strategically allocates an increasing portion of the assets of the pension plan to fixed income securities as the funding status improves. The intended purpose of using the Dynamic Asset Allocation strategy is that the expected change in the value of the plan assets and the change in pension benefit obligation due to market movements are more likely to have more correlation versus a static allocation of assets between categories.

 Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk. We use or have used various derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, interest rate options, TBA forwards, bond forwards, treasury forwards, swaptions and futures. We use interest rate swaps, treasury forwards and futures contracts to hedge against changes in the value of the GMWB MRB. We use interest rate swaps, treasury forwards and have used TBA forwards primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities. They can be used to change the sensitivity to the interest rate of specific assets and liabilities as well as an entire portfolio. We use bond forwards to fix the purchase price of a bond at a specified date in the future. We use interest rate options to manage prepayment risks in our assets and minimum guaranteed interest rates and lapse risks in our liabilities. We have purchased swaptions to hedge interest rate exposure for certain assets and liabilities. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk arises from foreign currency-denominated funding agreements issued to nonqualified institutional investors in the international market, foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, and our international operations, including expected cash flows and potential acquisition and divestiture activity. We estimate as of September 30, 2024, a 10 immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed would result in no material change to the net fair value of our foreign currency-denominated instruments identified above because we effectively hedge foreign currency-denominated instruments to minimize exchange rate impacts, which is consistent with our estimate as of December 31, 2023. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates do affect the translation of segment pre-tax operating earnings and equity of our international operations into our consolidated financial statements. For our Principal International operations, we estimate that a 10 immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we were exposed would have resulted in a 269.9 million, or 10 , reduction in the total equity excluding noncontrolling interests of our international operations as of September 30, 2024, as compared to an estimated 285.0 million, or 10 , reduction as of December 31, 2023. We estimate a 10 unfavorable change in the average foreign currency exchange rates to which we were exposed through our international operations would have resulted in a 13.8 million, or 11 , reduction in segment pre-tax operating earnings of our international operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an estimated 8.8 million, or 12 , reduction for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, we estimate that a 10 unfavorable change in the average foreign currency exchange rates to which we were exposed through our international operations would have resulted in a 30.6 million, or 12 , reduction in segment pre-tax operating earnings of our international operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an estimated 26.4 million, or 12 , reduction for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The selection of a 10 immediate unfavorable change in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event. These exposures will change as a result of a change in the size and mix of our foreign operations. Use of Derivatives to Manage Foreign Currency Risk. The foreign currency risk on funding agreements and fixed maturities in our U.S. operations is mitigated by using currency swaps that swap the foreign currency interest and principal payments to our functional currency. We did not have currency swap agreements associated with foreign-denominated liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The notional amount of our currency swap agreements associated with foreign-denominated fixed maturities was 2,368.8 million and 1,888.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. With regard to our international operations, in order to enhance the diversification of our investment portfolios we may invest in bonds denominated in a currency that is different than the currency of our liabilities. We use foreign exchange derivatives to economically hedge the currency mismatch. Our Principal International operations had currency swaps with a notional amount of 231.1 million and 217.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our Principal International operations also utilized currency forwards with a notional amount of 691.5 million and 711.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We use currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with expected cash flows in our foreign operations. We held currency forwards with a notional of 231.3 million and 265.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

 156 

Table of Contents 
 Additionally, we use currency forwards to hedge net equity investments in our foreign operations, including certain sponsored investment funds. We held currency forwards with a notional amount of 53.2 million and 31.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We also use currency forwards to hedge certain foreign-denominated investments in our domestic operations. We held currency forwards with a notional amount of 56.0 million and 54.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Equity Risk Equity risk is the risk we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in equity markets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our equity securities was 1,581.9 million and 1,478.1 million, respectively. We estimate a 10 decline in the prices of the equity securities would result in a decline in fair value of our equity securities of 158.2 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to a decline in fair value of our equity securities of 147.8 million as of December 31, 2023. We are also exposed to the risk that asset-based fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in investment prices and the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower. We also have equity risk associated with (1) universal life contracts that credit interest to customers based on changes in an external equity index; (2) variable annuity contracts that have a GMWB rider that allows the customer to make withdrawals of a specified annual amount, either for a fixed number of years or for the lifetime of the customer, even if the account value is reduced to zero; (3) variable annuity contracts that have a GMDB that allows the death benefit to be paid, even if the account value has fallen below the GMDB amount; (4) SEC-registered annuity contracts with returns linked to an external equity index and (5) investment contracts in which the return is subject to minimum contractual guarantees. We are also subject to equity risk based upon the assets that support our employee benefit plans. For further discussion of equity risk associated with these plans, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Benefit Plans in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We estimate an immediate 10 downward equity shock, followed by a 2 per quarter increase would reduce our annual segment pre-tax operating earnings by approximately 5 to 8 over the next twelve months. The selection of a 10 unfavorable equity shock should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event. Our exposure will change as a result of changes in our mix of business. Separate and distinct from our equity risk associated with a decline in the S P index, we also have equity risk associated with certain domestic alternative investments. These investments are comprised of several asset categories (including hedge funds, private equity, infrastructure and direct lending) that provide an attractive asset match to our long-dated liabilities and create diversification benefits to our fixed income investments. The risk profile of these investments is actively monitored by our Investment Committee and our corporate risk management function. Changes in the value of these investments will impact earnings. We estimate an immediate 10 decline in the value of those assets, followed by a 2 per quarter increase would reduce our annual segment pre-tax operating earnings by less than 8 . The selection of a 10 unfavorable change in the value of those assets should not be construed as a prediction of future market events, but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such a decline in value of those assets. Use of Derivatives to Manage Equity Risk. We economically hedge the universal life products, where the interest credited is linked to an external equity index, by purchasing options that match the product s profile or selling options to offset existing exposures. We economically hedge RILA index credit exposure using options and futures. We economically hedge the GMWB rider MRB exposure, which includes interest rate risk and equity risk, using futures, options, treasury forwards and interest rate swaps with notional amounts of 7,791.8 million and 8,600.5 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of both MRBs and associated hedging instruments are sensitive to financial market conditions and the variance related to the change in fair value of these items for a given period is largely dependent on market conditions at the end of the period.
