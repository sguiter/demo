 New York Stock Exchange Listing and Reverse Stock Split 
 On June 13, 2024, the Company's common stock, par value per share, or the Common Stock, was listed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the ticker symbol "SILA", or the Listing. Upon the Listing, all outstanding shares of Class I Common Stock and Class T Common Stock were automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis and authorized but unissued shares of Class I Common Stock, Class T Common Stock and Class T2 Common Stock were reclassified into additional shares of Class A Common Stock. Class A Common Stock was then immediately renamed Common Stock and is the sole class of stock traded on the NYSE. 
 On April 8, 2024, in anticipation of the Listing, the Company amended its charter to effect a one-for-four reverse stock split, or the Reverse Stock Split, of each issued and outstanding share of each class of Common Stock of the Company, effective May 1, 2024, and the Company also amended its charter to decrease the par value of each issued and outstanding share of the Company's Common Stock from par value per share to par value per share immediately after the Reverse Stock Split. In addition, equitable adjustments were made to the maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the Company s Amended and Restated 2014 Restricted Share Plan, or the A R Incentive Plan, and the maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock that may be granted under incentive stock awards under the A R Incentive Plan, in each case, to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The number of shares of the Company's Common Stock subject to outstanding awards under the A R Incentive Plan were also equitably adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split affected all record holders of the Company s Common Stock uniformly and did not affect any record holder s percentage ownership interest. The Reverse Stock Split did not affect the number of the Company s authorized shares of Common Stock. All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted as though the Reverse Stock Split had been effected prior to all periods presented.

The leases with tenants at properties under the common control of Post Acute Medical, LLC and its affiliates accounted for of rental revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Impairment Losses 
 The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of the asset group by estimating undiscounted future cash flows, including eventual disposition. Based on this analysis, if the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment charge will be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset group. When testing goodwill for impairment, if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. The fair values are determined based on the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , or ASC 820.

The GenesisCare Amended Master Lease removed of the Company's properties from the GenesisCare Master Lease, or the Severed Properties. The properties remaining under the GenesisCare Amended Master Lease will continue to be leased to GenesisCare and had no material changes in lease terms pursuant to the GenesisCare Master Lease. As a result of the GenesisCare Amended Master Lease, the Company entered into lease agreements with new tenants at of the Severed Properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The Company determined that the inputs used to value its interest rate swaps, with the exception of the credit valuation adjustment, fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The credit valuation adjustments associated with these instruments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and the respective counterparty. However, as of September 30, 2024, the Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate swaps. As a result, the Company determined that its interest rate swaps valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize or be liable for on disposition of the financial assets and liabilities.

 Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features 
 The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company either defaults or is capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The Company records credit risk valuation adjustments on its interest rate swaps based on the respective credit quality of the Company and the counterparty. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into agreements with creditworthy counterparties. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no derivatives with fair value in a net liability position, inclusive of accrued interest but excluding any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to the agreement. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no termination events or events of default related to the interest rate swaps.

Repurchases of Common Stock under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated purchases, in accelerated share repurchase programs or by any other lawful means.

 Overview 
 We invest in high quality properties leased to tenants capitalizing on critical and structural economic growth drivers. We are primarily focused on investing in healthcare facilities across the continuum of care, which we believe typically generate predictable, durable and growing income streams. We may also make other real estate-related investments, which may include equity or debt interests in other real estate entities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned 136 real estate properties and two undeveloped land parcels. 
 Recent Developments 
 New York Stock Exchange Listing and Reverse Stock Split 
 On June 13, 2024, our common stock, par value 0.01 per share, or the Common Stock, was listed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the ticker symbol "SILA", or the Listing. Upon the Listing, all outstanding shares of Class I Common Stock and Class T Common Stock were automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis and authorized but unissued shares of Class I Common Stock, Class T Common Stock and Class T2 Common Stock were reclassified into additional shares of Class A Common Stock. Class A Common Stock was then immediately renamed Common Stock and is the sole class of stock traded on the NYSE. 
 On April 8, 2024, in anticipation of the Listing, we amended our charter to effect a one-for-four reverse stock split, or the Reverse Stock Split, of each issued and outstanding share of each class of our Common Stock, 0.01 par value per share, effective May 1, 2024, and we also amended our charter to decrease the par value of each issued and outstanding share of our Common Stock from 0.04 par value per share to 0.01 par value per share immediately after the Reverse Stock Split. In addition, equitable adjustments were made to the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2014 Restricted Share Plan, or the A R Incentive Plan, and the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be granted under incentive stock awards under the A R Incentive Plan, in each case, to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The number of shares of our Common Stock subject to outstanding awards under the A R Incentive Plan were also equitably adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split affected all record holders of our Common Stock uniformly and did not affect any record holder s percentage ownership interest. The Reverse Stock Split did not affect the number of our authorized shares of Common Stock. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On August 16, 2024, our board of directors, or the Board, authorized a share repurchase program of up to the lesser of 1,500,000 shares of our outstanding Common Stock, or 25,000,000 in gross purchase proceeds for a period of 12 months from August 16, 2024, or the Share Repurchase Program. Repurchases of Common Stock under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated purchases, in accelerated share repurchase programs or by any other lawful means. The number of shares of Common Stock purchased and the timing of any purchases will depend on a number of factors, including the price and availability of Common Stock and general market conditions. We did not repurchase any shares under the Share Repurchase Program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, up to 25,000,000 of our Common Stock remained available for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 Termination of Share Repurchase Program and Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 In light of our intention to pursue the Listing, on April 5, 2024, the Board approved the suspension of our Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Program, or the Terminated SRP, effective immediately, and the termination of the Terminated SRP, effective upon the Listing. On April 5, 2024, the Board also approved the termination of our distribution reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, effective May 1, 2024. 
 "Dutch Auction" Tender Offer 
 On June 13, 2024, in conjunction with the Listing, we commenced a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer, or the Tender Offer, to purchase shares of our Common Stock for cash at a price per share of not greater than 24.00 nor less than 22.60, net to the seller in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, for a maximum aggregate purchase price of no more than 50,000,000. The Tender Offer expired on July 19, 2024. As a result of the Tender Offer, we accepted for purchase 2,212,389 shares of Common Stock (which represented approximately 3.9 of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of July 19, 2024) at a purchase price of 22.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 50,000,000, excluding all related costs and fees. The Company incurred 2,093,000 of costs and fees related to the Tender Offer which are recorded as a reduction in equity on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. We funded the Tender Offer and related costs and fees with our available cash.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our critical accounting estimates are disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as disclosed therein. 
 Interim Unaudited Financial Data 
 Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full year results may be less favorable. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Qualification as a REIT 
 We elected, and qualify, to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we intend to continue to be taxed as a REIT. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90.0 of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. 
 If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, we would then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
 
 Factors That May Influence Results of Operations 
 We are not aware at this time of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions and those discussed below, affecting our real estate properties, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income, management and operation of our properties other than those set forth in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Economic and Market Conditions 
 Our operating results have been and will continue to be generally impacted by global and national economic and market conditions and by the local economic conditions where our real estate properties are located. Increased interest rates, persistent inflation, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and increased volatility in public and private equity and fixed income markets have led to increased costs and have limited the availability of capital. In response to inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in 2022. Though these higher interest rates have begun to decline in September 2024, and there are signs that the limitations on the availability of capital are moderating, there can be no assurances that this will continue to be the case. Higher interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve to address inflation may adversely impact our borrowing costs and real estate asset values generally, including our real estate properties. 
 To the extent our tenants have also experienced difficulties due to the foregoing economic and market conditions, they may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations when due. Most of our lease agreements contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation, including annual rent increases based on stated increases or consumer price index (CPI) increases. 
 Rental Revenue 
 The amount of rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of leased space and to lease available space at existing rental rates. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental revenue in future periods. We continually monitor our tenants' ability to meet their lease obligations to pay us rent to determine if any adjustments should be reflected currently. As of September 30, 2024, our real estate properties were 95.5 leased.

 Steward Bankruptcy Filing 
 On May 6, 2024, Steward Health Care System LLC, or Steward, the sponsor and owner of a tenant at the Stoughton Healthcare Facility, announced that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 1,392,000 of contractual base rent from Steward, which represents monthly contractual base rent, except for April and May for which Steward did not pay, and prorated rent through September 19, 2024, when the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas approved Steward's request to reject our lease. 
 On August 12, 2024, we entered into a contract for sale with a buyer for the Stoughton Healthcare Facility; however, the buyer terminated the contract on November 4, 2024. We intend to market the property for sale or lease. 
 During the three months ended December 31, 2023, due to the ongoing operational and liquidity challenges faced by Steward, we determined the collectability of amounts owed under the contractual terms of Steward's lease were no longer reasonably assured. As a result, we ceased recognizing rent on a straight-line basis and have only recorded rent for Steward to the extent we have received cash. We recorded a write-off of straight-line rent receivables related to Steward of 1,604,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2023, as a reduction in rental revenue, because the amounts were determined to be uncollectible. In addition, we recorded 10,945,000 of impairment losses (including goodwill impairments of 350,000) on the real estate property leased to Steward during the three months ended December 31, 2023. There were no further impairment losses recorded on the real estate property leased to Steward for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 GenesisCare Bankruptcy Filing 
 As disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K that the Company filed with the SEC on June 5, 2023, GenesisCare USA, Inc. and its affiliates, or GenesisCare, the sponsor and owner of the tenant in certain of our real estate properties announced that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code on June 1, 2023. During the bankruptcy proceedings, GenesisCare sought U.S. bankruptcy court approval to reject certain unexpired real property leases. GenesisCare's lease obligations with us were not included in any motions. On March 27, 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment to the second amended and restated master lease, or the GenesisCare Amended Master Lease, with GenesisCare in connection with its emergence from bankruptcy on February 16, 2024. Prior to the GenesisCare Amended Master Lease, GenesisCare was a tenant at 17 of our real estate properties pursuant to a first amendment to the second amended and restated master lease, or the GenesisCare Master Lease. The GenesisCare Amended Master Lease removed 10 of our properties from the GenesisCare Master Lease, or the Severed Properties. The seven properties remaining under the GenesisCare Amended Master Lease will continue to be leased to GenesisCare and had no material changes in lease terms pursuant to the GenesisCare Master Lease. As a result of the GenesisCare Amended Master Lease, we entered into lease agreements with new tenants at six of the Severed Properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Fort Myers Healthcare Facilities, which were sold on September 25, 2024 for a sales price of 15,500,000, generating net proceeds of 14,681,000, excluding real estate tax pro-rations, represented two of the Severed Properties. The Company is currently in the process of negotiating a lease with a new tenant at one of the Severed Properties. Additionally, on October 24, 2024, we entered into a contract for sale with a buyer for one of the Severed Properties. In exchange for the Severed Properties, we received a 2,000,000 severance fee from GenesisCare, or the GenesisCare Severance Fee, on March 27, 2024. We will recognize the GenesisCare Severance Fee in rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the remaining GenesisCare Amended Master Lease term. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 57,000 and 117,000, respectively, of amortization of the GenesisCare Severance Fee in rental revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
 Due to GenesisCare filing for bankruptcy, we determined the collectability of amounts owed under the contractual terms of GenesisCare's lease were no longer reasonably assured. As a result, we ceased recognizing rent on a straight-line basis and have only recorded rent for GenesisCare to the extent we have received cash. GenesisCare continues to make its lease payments due to us in accordance with the GenesisCare Amended Master Lease and made its lease payments throughout its bankruptcy pursuant to the GenesisCare Master Lease. 
 We recorded impairment losses of 418,000, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, attributable to the Fort Myers Healthcare Facilities, following a reduction in the expected sales price that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss on disposition of 792,000, which is presented in impairment and disposition losses in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded accelerated amortization of in-place lease intangible assets, above-market lease intangible assets and below-market lease intangible liabilities of 4,646,000, 2,667,000, and 2,038,000, respectively, as a result of the GenesisCare Amended Master Lease. 
 We recorded a write-off of straight-line rent receivables related to GenesisCare of 1,630,000, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a reduction in rental revenue, because the amounts were determined to be uncollectible. We recorded

In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an impairment of in-place lease and above-market lease intangible assets on certain real estate properties formerly leased to GenesisCare of 592,000 and 260,000, respectively. We recorded impairment losses on a real estate property formerly leased to GenesisCare of 3,115,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an impairment of in-place lease intangible assets on a real estate property formerly leased to GenesisCare of 538,000.

 This section describes and compares our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We generate substantially all of our revenue from property operations. In order to evaluate our overall portfolio, management analyzes the results of our same store properties. We define "same store properties" as properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar periods being compared and exclude properties under development, re-development, or classified as held for sale. 
 By evaluating the results of our same store properties, management is able to monitor the operations of our existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of our current portfolio and readily observe the expected effects of our new acquisitions and dispositions on net income. Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The following table allocates total rental revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period in 2023 (amounts in thousands).

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal uses of funds are for acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments, capital expenditures, operating expenses, distributions to, and share repurchases from, stockholders, and principal and interest payments on current and future indebtedness. While interest rates on variable rate debt have increased in recent years but have declined some due to the recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, we believe our exposure to increased or fluctuating interest rates is limited at this time due to our hedging strategy, which has effectively fixed 100 of our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, and therefore allowed us to reasonably project our liquidity needs. Generally, cash for these items is generated from operations of our current and future investments. Our sources of funds are primarily operating cash flows, our credit facility and other potential borrowings. 
 When we acquire a property, we prepare a capital plan that contemplates the estimated capital needs of that investment. In addition to operating expenses, capital needs may also include, for example, costs of refurbishment, tenant improvements or other major capital expenditures. The capital plan also sets forth the anticipated sources of the necessary capital, which may include a line of credit, operating cash generated by the investment, additional equity investments from us, and when necessary, capital reserves. The capital plan for each investment will be adjusted through ongoing, regular reviews of our portfolio or, as necessary, to respond to unanticipated additional capital needs. 
 Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 For at least the next twelve months, we expect our principal demands for funds will be for operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses, as well as the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related investments, including mezzanine loans, and funding of capital improvements and tenant improvements, distributions to and stock repurchases from stockholders, and interest payments on our credit facility. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by operations and borrowings on our credit facility and potential other borrowings. 
 We believe we will have sufficient liquidity available to meet our obligations in a timely manner, under both normal and stressed conditions, for the next twelve months. In addition, we expect that the Listing will enhance our liquidity given that we now have publicly-traded stock. We may issue such publicly-traded stock within the next twelve months, afterwards, or both to raise funds to meet our liquidity needs. 
 Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Beyond the next twelve months, we expect our principal demands for funds will be for costs to acquire additional real estate properties, interest and principal payments on our credit facility, long-term capital investment demands for our real estate properties and distributions necessary to maintain our REIT status. 
 We currently expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through proceeds from cash flows from operations and borrowings on our credit facility, potential other borrowings and potential equity offerings. 
 We expect to pay distributions to our stockholders from cash flows from operations. To the extent cash flows from operations are lower due to lower-than-expected returns on the properties held or the disposition of properties, distributions paid to stockholders may be lower. We currently expect that substantially all net cash flows from our operations will be used to fund acquisitions, certain capital expenditures identified at acquisition, ongoing capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on outstanding debt and distributions to our stockholders. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 28,606,000 in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to the cash we need to conduct our normal business operations, we expect to require 27,978,000 in cash over the next twelve months, of which 25,201,000 is related to estimated interest payments on our outstanding debt (calculated based on our effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024) and 2,777,000 is related to our various obligations as lessee. We cannot provide assurances, however, that actual expenditures will not exceed these estimates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had material obligations beyond twelve months in the amount of 690,830,000, inclusive of 575,932,000 related to principal and estimated interest payments on our outstanding debt (calculated based on our effective interest rates as of September 30, 2024) and 114,898,000 related to our various obligations as lessee. 
 One of our principal liquidity needs is the payment of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we had 525,000,000 of principal outstanding under our Unsecured Credit Facility (as defined below). We are required by the terms of certain loan documents relating to the Unsecured Credit Facility to meet certain covenants, such as financial ratios and reporting requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants and requirements on our Unsecured Credit Facility.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate notional amount under our derivative instruments was 525,000,000. We have agreements with each derivative counterparty that contain cross-default provisions; if we default on our indebtedness, then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations, resulting in an acceleration of payment of any net amounts due under our derivative contracts. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such cross-default provisions. 
 Debt Service Requirements 
 Credit Facility 
 As of September 30, 2024, the maximum commitments available under our senior unsecured revolving line of credit with Truist Bank, as Administrative Agent for the lenders, or the Revolving Credit Agreement, were 500,000,000, which may be increased, subject to lender approval, through incremental term loans and/or revolving loan commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 1,000,000,000. The maturity date for the Revolving Credit Agreement is February 15, 2026, which, at our election, may be extended for a period of six-months on no more than two occasions, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee. As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Credit Agreement had no outstanding principal balance. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the maximum commitments available under our senior unsecured term loan with Truist Bank, as Administrative Agent for the lenders, or the 2027 Term Loan Agreement, were 250,000,000, which may be increased, subject to lender approval, to an aggregate amount not to exceed 500,000,000. The 2027 Term Loan Agreement has a maturity date of March 20, 2027, and, at our election, may be extended for a period of one year on no more than two occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee. The 2027 Term Loan Agreement was entered into on March 20, 2024, to replace our prior term loan agreement, which was paid off in its entirety upon closing of the 2027 Term Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the 2027 Term Loan Agreement had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of 250,000,000. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the maximum commitments available under our senior unsecured term loan with Truist Bank, as Administrative Agent for the lenders, or the 2028 Term Loan Agreement, were 275,000,000, which may be increased, subject to lender approval, to an aggregate amount not to exceed 500,000,000 and has a maturity date of January 31, 2028. The 2028 Term Loan Agreement is pari passu with our Revolving Credit Agreement and 2027 Term Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the 2028 Term Loan Agreement had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of 275,000,000. 
 We refer to the Revolving Credit Agreement, the 2027 Term Loan Agreement and the 2028 Term Loan Agreement, collectively, as the Unsecured Credit Facility, which has aggregate commitments available of 1,025,000,000, as of September 30, 2024. Generally, the proceeds of loans made under our Unsecured Credit Facility may be used for acquisition of real estate investments, funding of tenant improvements and leasing commissions with respect to real estate, repayment of indebtedness, funding of capital expenditures with respect to real estate, and general corporate and working capital purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a total pool availability under our Unsecured Credit Facility of 1,025,000,000 and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of 525,000,000; therefore, 500,000,000 was available to be drawn under our Unsecured Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all the financial covenant requirements of the Unsecured Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 97,267 97,841 (574) Net cash used in investing activities (149,024) (59,023) (90,001) Net cash used in financing activities (121,822) (37,172) (84,650) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to property dispositions, vacancies, and lease terminations with Steward and GenesisCare, partially offset by an increase in cash collected for rent resulting from property acquisitions, annual rent increases, dividend income from money market funds, and the receipt of lease termination income.

 Draw of 20,000,000 on the Revolving Credit Agreement to fund an acquisition. 
 Repayment of 20,000,000 on the Revolving Credit Agreement with proceeds from dispositions and cash flows from operations. 
 The following Unsecured Credit Facility related activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Repayment of 8,000,000 on the Revolving Credit Agreement with cash flows from operations. 
 Repayment of 20,000,000 on the 2024 Term Loan Agreement with proceeds from a disposition, the collection of a note receivable related to a disposition and cash flows from operations; and 
 Draw of 50,000,000 on the Revolving Credit Agreement to fund an acquisition. 
 Distributions to Stockholders 
 The amount of distributions payable to our stockholders is determined by the Board and is dependent on a number of factors, including our funds available for distribution, financial condition, lenders' restrictions and limitations, capital expenditure requirements, corporate law restrictions and the annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Board must authorize each distribution and may, in the future, authorize lower amounts of distributions or not authorize additional distributions and, therefore, distribution payments are not guaranteed. Additionally, our organizational documents permit us to pay distributions from unlimited amounts of any source, and we may use sources other than operating cash flows to fund distributions, which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in properties or other permitted investments. We have funded distributions with operating cash flows from our properties and previously through funds equal to amounts reinvested in the DRIP. To the extent that we do not have taxable income, distributions paid will be considered a return of capital to stockholders. 
 In light of our intention to pursue the Listing, on April 5, 2024, the Board approved the termination of the DRIP, effective May 1, 2024. All participating DRIP stockholders will continue to receive their full declared distributions, which will be payable in cash as opposed to additional shares of Common Stock and will result in an increase in cash used in financing activities.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In the real estate industry, analysts and investors employ certain non-GAAP supplemental financial measures in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons between periods and among peer companies. We believe that these measures are useful to investors to consider because they may assist them to better understand and measure the performance of our business over time and against similar companies. We use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Funds From Operations, or FFO, Core Funds From Operations, or Core FFO, and Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO. 
 Net Income and FFO, Core FFO and AFFO 
 A description of FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, are provided below. 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated the FFO measure, which we believe is an appropriate additional measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income as determined under GAAP. 
 We define FFO, consistent with NAREIT s definition, as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains from sales of real estate assets, impairment of real estate assets and disposition losses from sales of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. To date, we do not have any investments in unconsolidated partnerships or joint ventures. 
 We, along with many of our peers in the real estate industry, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT s operating performance because it is based on a net income analysis of real estate portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization and real estate impairments. We believe FFO provides a useful understanding of our performance to the investors and to our management, and when compared to year over year, FFO reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy. 
 We calculate Core FFO by adjusting FFO to remove the effect of certain GAAP non-cash income and expense items, unusual and infrequent items that are not expected to impact our operating performance on an ongoing basis, items that affect comparability to prior periods and/or items that are not related to our core real estate operations. We consider it to be a useful supplemental financial performance measure because it provides investors with additional information to understand our sustainable performance. Excluded items include listing-related expenses, severance, write-off of straight-line rent receivables related to prior periods, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles (including ground leases) and loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 We calculate AFFO by further adjusting Core FFO for the following items: deferred rent, current period straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of deferred financing costs and stock-based compensation. We believe AFFO is a supplemental performance measure that provides investors appropriate supplemental information to evaluate our ongoing operations. AFFO is a metric used by management to evaluate our dividend policy.

Table of Contents 

 Presentation of this information is intended to assist management and investors in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO, Core FFO and AFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO, Core FFO and AFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or as an indication of our liquidity, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may be useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods. All of our non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance. The method used to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be considered a more relevant measure of operating performance and more prominent than the non-GAAP financial measures presented here. 
 Reconciliation of Net Income to FFO, Core FFO and AFFO 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO, Core FFO and AFFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (amounts in thousands):

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. 
 We have obtained variable rate debt financing and we are exposed to such changes in the one-month Term SOFR. Loans under the Unsecured Credit Facility may be made as Base Rate Loans or SOFR Loans, at our election, and all of our interest 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 rate swap agreements are indexed to SOFR. Our objectives in managing interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on operations and cash flows, and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we will borrow primarily at interest rates with the lowest margins available and, in some cases, with the ability to convert variable interest rates to fixed rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total principal debt outstanding of 525,000,000 was fixed through 11 interest rate swap agreements, which mature on various dates from December 2024 to January 2028. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate swap agreements had an aggregate notional amount of 525,000,000 and an aggregate settlement asset value of 7,303,000. The settlement value of these interest rate swap agreements is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads. As of September 30, 2024, an increase of 50 basis points in the market rates of interest would have resulted in an increase to the settlement asset value of these interest rate swaps to a value of 11,575,000. As of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 50 basis points in the market rates of interest would have resulted in a decrease to the settlement asset value of these interest rate swaps to a value of 2,943,000. These interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Of the 11 interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of September 30, 2024, five interest rate swap agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of 250,000,000, mature on December 31, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on our total principal debt outstanding was 3.3 , including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements. We have entered, and may continue to enter, into additional derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a given variable rate financial instrument. To the extent we do, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, it does not possess credit risk. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. We manage the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate swap transactions for speculative purposes. We may also enter into rate-lock arrangements to lock interest rates on future borrowings. 
 In addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our future investments will be subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt, if necessary. 
 We do not have any foreign operations, and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risks. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that we adopt outweigh their costs. 
 As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we conducted an evaluation as of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. On March 20, 2024, we terminated our chief accounting officer and our new chief accounting officer commenced employment on July 1, 2024 (and upon such commencement, our chief financial officer continues to serve as our "principal accounting officer" as used in applicable SEC rules and regulations). This change did not materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. Taking into account this change, as noted above, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

 25.20 25,000,000 Total 2,212,571 22.60 
 
 (1) On June 13, 2024, in conjunction with the Listing, we commenced the Tender Offer to purchase shares of our Common Stock for cash at a price per share of not greater than 24.00 nor less than 22.60, net to the seller in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, for a maximum aggregate purchase price of no more than 50,000,000. The Tender Offer expired on July 19, 2024. As a result of the Tender Offer, we accepted for purchase 2,212,389 shares of Common Stock (which represented approximately 3.9 of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of July 19, 2024) at a purchase price of 22.60 per share. Total cash required to complete the Tender Offer was 50,000,000, excluding all costs and fees of the tender. The Company incurred 2,093,000 of costs and fees related to the Tender Offer which are recorded as a reduction in equity on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 (2) As announced on August 19, 2024, on August 16, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the Share Repurchase Program of up to the lesser of 1,500,000 shares of our outstanding Common Stock, or 25,000,000 in gross purchase proceeds for a period of 12 months from August 16, 2024. Repurchases of Common Stock under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated purchases, in accelerated share repurchase programs or by any other lawful means. The number of shares of Common Stock purchased and the timing of any purchases will depend on a number of factors, including the price and availability of Common Stock and general market conditions. We did not repurchase any shares under the Share Repurchase Program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, up to 25,000,000 of our Common Stock remained available for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program.
