Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of FS Credit Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FS Credit Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Adoption of New Accounting Standard 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for accounting for current expected credit losses upon its adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326) in 2023. See below for discussion of our related critical audit matter. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) 
 Description of the Matter 
 As discussed above and in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortized cost. As described in Notes 2 and 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company establishes a reserve for loans receivable, held-for-investment and mortgage-backed securities, held-to-maturity that reflects its estimate of current expected credit losses (CECL) over the expected life of the loans and debt securities included in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company reassesses the reserve for CECL at each balance sheet date and recognizes changes in earnings. The reserve includes a general and specific CECL reserve of 76.9 million and 3.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. 
 In estimating the general CECL reserve, management uses a third-party probability-weighted analytical model that considers the likelihood of default and loss-given-default for each individual loan and debt security. For determining a specific CECL reserve for collateral dependent loans and debt securities, the Company measures the expected losses based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan or debt security. The Company estimates the fair value of the collateral using a discounted cash flow model which requires significant judgments. 
 Auditing the Company s CECL reserves was especially challenging due to the complexity of the models and the significant estimation uncertainty of the inputs and assumptions used in the models, including probability of default, loss given default and stabilized fair value of collateral. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 To test the CECL reserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology, model, and significant assumptions and testing the completeness and accuracy of the inputs. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the probability of defaults and loss given defaults by comparing to independently obtained peer data. With the assistance of our real estate valuation specialists, for a sample of collateral dependent loans, we corroborated the reasonableness of current and stabilized fair values and stabilized net operating income of the underlying collateral utilized in developing the reserve by comparing to independently obtained market data.

The Company is also conducting a private offering of its Class I common stock to certain accredited investors. 
 The Company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2017. The Company intends to be an investment vehicle of indefinite duration focused on real estate debt investments and other real estate-related assets. The shares of common stock are generally intended to be sold and repurchased by the Company on a continuous basis. The Company intends to conduct its operations so that it is not required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). 
 The Company s primary investment objectives are to: provide current income in the form of regular, stable cash distributions to achieve an attractive dividend yield; preserve and protect invested capital; realize appreciation in net asset value ("NAV") from proactive investment management and asset management; and provide an investment alternative for stockholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to commercial real estate debt with lower volatility than public real estate companies.

 Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due to it pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is determined to be impaired, the Company records the impairment as a specific CECL reserve. For determining a specific CECL reserve, financial instruments are assessed outside of the CECL model on an individual basis. For collateral dependent loans that the Company determines foreclosure of the collateral is probable, the Company measures the expected losses based on the differences between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. For collateral dependent loans where the Company determine foreclosure is not probable, a practical expedient to estimate expected losses is applied using the difference between the collateral s fair value (less costs to sell the asset if repayment is expected through the sale of the collateral) and the amortized cost basis of the loan. These valuations require significant judgments, which include assumptions regarding capitalization rates, leasing, creditworthiness of major tenants, occupancy rates, availability of financing, exit plan, loan sponsorship, actions of other lenders, and other factors deemed necessary by FS Real Estate Advisor and Rialto. Actual losses, if any, could ultimately differ from these estimates. 
 The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified-retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost. Prior to its adoption, the Company had no loan loss provisions on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings in its consolidated statement of changes in equity as of January 1, 2023.

 Separate provisions of ASC Topic 326 apply to the Mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale, which are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company is required to establish an initial credit loss allowance for those available-for-sale securities that are purchased with credit deterioration PCD by grossing up the amortized cost basis of each security and providing an offsetting credit loss allowance for the difference between expected cash flows and contractual cash flows, both on a present value basis. As of the January 1, 2023 effective date, no such credit loss allowance gross-up was required on available-for-sale debt securities with PCD. 
 The Company uses a discounted cash flow method to estimate and recognize a credit loss allowance on its available-for-sale securities. The credit loss allowance represents the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of expected cash flows. The credit loss allowance is limited to the difference between the security's fair value and its amortized cost. Changes in the credit loss allowance are recognized immediately in earnings as a component of Credit loss expense, net.

 The Company s management reviews its real estate properties for impairment each quarter or when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impaired value. Since the impairment model considers real estate properties to be long-lived assets to be held and used, cash flows to determine whether an asset has been impaired are undiscounted. Accordingly, the Company s strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If the Company s strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material to the Company s results. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. During the periods presented, no such impairment occurred.

 , and upfront dealer manager fees of of the transaction price of each Class T share sold in the primary offering, however such amounts may vary at certain participating broker-dealers provided that the sum will not exceed of the transaction price (subject to reductions for certain categories of purchasers). FS Investment Solutions is entitled to receive upfront selling commissions of up to of the transaction price per Class S share sold in the primary offering (subject to reductions for certain categories of purchasers).

Pursuant to the dealer manager agreement, the Company also reimburses FS Investment Solutions or participating broker-dealers for bona fide due diligence expenses, provided that total organization and offering expenses shall not exceed of the gross proceeds in the Company's public offering.

 Subject to the limitations described below, the Company pays FS Investment Solutions stockholder servicing fees for ongoing services rendered to stockholders by participating broker-dealers or by broker-dealers servicing stockholders accounts, referred to as servicing broker-dealers:

 In addition, the Company will cease paying stockholder servicing fees on each Class D share, Class M share, Class S share and Class T share held in a stockholder s account and each such share will convert to Class I shares on the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a listing of Class I shares on a national securities exchange; (ii) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s assets or the Company s merger or consolidation with or into another entity in a transaction in which holders of Class D, Class M, Class S or Class T shares receive cash and/or shares of stock that are listed on a national securities exchange; or (iii) the date following the completion of the Company s public offering on which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources in connection with the Company s public offering, including selling commissions, dealer manager fees, stockholder servicing fees and other underwriting compensation, is equal to of the gross proceeds from its primary offering.

 (1) Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class T, Class S, Class D and Class M shares. Under GAAP, the Company accrues future stockholder servicing fees in an amount equal to its best estimate of fees payable to FS Investment Solutions at the time such shares are sold. For purposes of NAV, the Company recognizes the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis. As a result, the estimated liability for the future stockholder servicing fees, which are accrued at the time each share is sold, will have no effect on the NAV of any class.

The purchase price for shares pursuant to the distribution reinvestment plan will be equal to the transaction price for such shares at the time the distribution is payable. 
 Distributions 
 The Company generally intends to distribute substantially all of its taxable income, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP, to its stockholders each year to comply with the REIT provisions of the Code. Dividends are paid first to the holders of the Company s Series A preferred stock at the rate of per annum plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, and then to the holders of the Company s common stock.

 February 2024 
 The distributions for each class of outstanding common stock have been or will be paid monthly to stockholders of record as of the monthly record dates previously determined by the Company's board of directors. These distributions have been or will be paid in cash or reinvested in shares of the Company s common stock for stockholders participating in the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. 
 For federal income tax purposes, distributions to stockholders are characterized as either ordinary income, capital gain or non-taxable return of capital. Distributions that exceed the Company's current and accumulated tax earnings and profits constitute a return of capital and reduce the stockholders basis in the common shares. To the extent that a distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholders basis in the common shares, the distributions will generally be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of such stockholders common shares. Under the new tax laws effective January 1, 2018, all distributions (other than distributions designated as capital gain distributions and distributions traceable to distributions from a taxable REIT subsidiary) which are received by a pass-through entity or an individual, are eligible for a deduction from gross income. This eligibility for a deduction will expire as of 2025. At the beginning of each year, the Company notifies its stockholders of the taxability of the distributions paid during the preceding year. In any given year, the overall taxability of distributions could be higher or lower than the preceding year.

 Loans receivable, held-for-investment Interest receivable Other assets Mortgage loans held in securitization trusts, at fair value Total assets Liabilities Collateralized loan obligations, net Interest payable Other liabilities Mortgage obligations issued by securitization trusts, at fair value Total liabilities 
 The Company has financed a portion of its loans through CLOs, which are considered VIEs. The Company has a controlling financial interest in the CLOs and, therefore, consolidates them on its balance sheets because the Company has both (i) the power to direct activities of the CLOs that most significantly affect the CLOs' economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits of the CLOs that could potentially be significant to the CLOs. 
 Assets held by the CLOs are restricted and can be used only to settle obligations of the CLOs. The liabilities are non-recourse to the Company and can only be satisfied from the assets of the CLOs. 
 Investment Securities 
 Mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts consolidated in accordance with ASC 810 are structured as pass through entities that receive principal and interest on the underlying collateral and distribute those payments to the certificate holders. The assets and other instruments held by these securitization entities are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of the entity. Additionally, the obligations of the securitization entities do not have any recourse to the general credit of any other consolidated entities, nor to the Company as the primary beneficiary. The mortgage obligations initially represent investment securities on the balance sheet (pre-consolidation). Upon consolidation of the mortgage loans and obligations, the associated investment securities are eliminated, as is the interest income related to those securities. 
 The inclusion of the assets and liabilities of the mortgage loans and obligations in which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary has no economic effect on the Company. Its exposure to the obligations of mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization is generally limited to its investment in these entities. The Company is not obligated to provide, nor has provided, any financial support for any of these consolidated structures. 
 Non-Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
 The Company invested in subordinated positions of CMBS trusts which are considered mortgage loans and obligations held in securitization trusts. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the mortgage loans and obligations because it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the mortgage loans and obligations' economic performance, nor does it provide guarantees or recourse to the mortgage loans and obligations other than standard representations and warranties and, therefore, does not consolidate the mortgage loans and obligations on its balance sheets. The Company has classified its investment in the CMBS as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale debt securities that are included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and are
