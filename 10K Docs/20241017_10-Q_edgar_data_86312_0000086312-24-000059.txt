 million. The acquisition provides the Company the opportunity to renew Corvus s book of business and to leverage Corvus s capabilities to enhance the return profile of Travelers existing cyber portfolio. At the acquisition date, the Company recorded at fair value million of assets acquired and million of liabilities assumed as part of purchase accounting, including million of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. The assets acquired from Corvus were included in the Company s Bond Specialty Insurance segment, effective at the acquisition date. The Company funded this transaction from internal resources. A provisional amount of million was recorded as a deferred tax asset and included on the consolidated balance sheet on January 2, 2024, the date of the acquisition. As the tax return for Corvus for the 2023 fiscal year will not be finalized until the fourth quarter of 2024, a measurement period adjustment is expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company recognized a one-time tax benefit of million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item impacted by the repeal of Internal Revenue Code Section 847, which related to the discounting of property-casualty loss reserves.

 of its fixed maturities at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 While the vast majority of the Company s fixed maturities are included in Level 2, the Company holds a number of corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using either another internal pricing matrix, a present value income approach or a broker quote (collectively, the other methodologies). The other methodologies include some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of observable market information available in the estimation of fair value, the Company includes the fair value estimates for bonds that are valued using the other methodologies in Level 3. 
 For certain investments in non-public common and preferred equity securities, the fair value estimate is determined either internally or by an external fund manager based on the impact of recent observable transactions on the investment, recent filings, operating results, balance sheet stability, growth and other business and market sector fundamentals. Due to the significant unobservable inputs in these valuations, the Company included the fair value estimate of million and million for these investments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in the amounts disclosed in Level 3. 
 For more information regarding the valuation of the Company s fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments, see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company s 2023 Annual Report.

 (1) Customer-related intangibles of million were recorded in connection with the acquisition of Corvus in the first quarter of 2024. The customer-related intangible assets include Corvus s broker and policyholder relationships and were valued using the excess earnings method income approach, a valuation technique that provides an estimate of fair value based on the cash flows that the asset can be expected to generate over its remaining useful life. Broker relationships represent the relationships Corvus has with its existing brokers through which new business is placed with policyholders. Policyholder relationships represent the renewal of existing policies. Significant inputs to the fair valuation include estimates of revenue growth, broker retention rates, policyholder attrition rates and weighted average cost of capital. 
 (2) Contract-based intangible assets subject to amortization are comprised of fair value adjustments on claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, reinsurance recoverables and other contract-related intangible assets. Fair value adjustments recorded in connection with insurance acquisitions were based on management s estimate of nominal claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. The method used calculated a risk adjustment to a risk-free discounted reserve that would, if reserves ran off as expected, produce results that yielded the assumed cost-of-capital on the capital supporting the loss reserves. The fair value adjustments are reported as other intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheet, and the amounts measured in accordance with the acquirer s accounting policies for insurance contracts have been reported as part of the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. The intangible assets are being recognized into income over the expected payment pattern. Because the time value of money and the risk adjustment (cost of capital) components of the intangible assets run off at different rates, the amount recognized in income may be a net benefit in some periods and a net expense in other periods. 
 (3) Marketing-related intangibles of million were recorded in connection with the acquisition of Corvus in the first quarter of 2024. The marketing-related intangible assets include trade names and a non-compete agreement. The trade names were valued using a relief from royalty method, a valuation technique which estimates the fair value of an asset based on the present value of the royalties saved because the company owns the asset. Significant inputs to the fair valuation include estimates of future revenue, appropriate rates of return associated with certain assets and weighted average cost of capital. The fair value of the non-compete agreement is based on an estimate of the income that would be lost if the agreement were not in place and the individual chose to compete. Significant inputs to the fair valuation include estimates of projected cash flows and weighted average cost of capital.

 The following discussions of the Company s net income and segment income (loss) are presented on an after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net income and segment income (loss) are presented on a pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of net income per common share are presented on a diluted basis. 
 Overview 
 Diluted net income per share of 5.42 in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 211 over diluted net income per share of 1.74 in the same period of 2023. Net income of 1.26 billion in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 212 over net income of 404 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in income before income taxes in the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development underlying underwriting margins ), (ii) net favorable prior year reserve development compared to net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the same period of 2023, (iii) higher net investment income and (iv) net realized investment gains compared to net realized investment losses in the same period of 2023, partially offset by (v) higher catastrophe losses. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the third quarter of 2024 was 126 million. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the third quarter of 2023 was 154 million. Catastrophe losses in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 939 million and 850 million, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins in the third quarter of 2024 were driven by Personal Insurance and Business Insurance, partially offset by Bond Specialty Insurance. Income tax expense in the third quarter of 2024 was higher than in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the increase in income before income taxes.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

Diluted net income per share of 12.51 in the first nine months of 2024 increased by 115 over diluted net income per share of 5.83 in the same period of 2023. Net income of 2.92 billion in the first nine months of 2024 increased by 114 over net income of 1.37 billion in the same period of 2023. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The increase in income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher underlying underwriting margins, (ii) higher net investment income, (iii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (iv) net realized investment gains compared to net realized investment losses in the same period of 2023, partially offset by (v) higher catastrophe losses. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 447 million and 11 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 3.16 billion and 2.87 billion, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins in the first nine months of 2024 were driven by Personal Insurance and Business Insurance, partially offset by Bond Specialty Insurance. The Company recorded income tax expense in the first nine months of 2024 compared with an income tax benefit in the same period of 2023. The change in income taxes primarily reflected the impact of the increase in income before income taxes and a one-time tax benefit of 211 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item. 
 The Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd s, as well as in Brazil and Colombia through joint ventures. Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported line items in the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The impact of these changes was not material to the Company s net income or segment income (loss) for the periods reported. 
 Revenues 
 Earned Premiums 
 Earned premiums in the third quarter of 2024 were 10.70 billion, 986 million or 10 higher than in the same period of 2023. Earned premiums in the first nine months of 2024 were 31.07 billion, 3.29 billion or 12 higher than in the same period of 2023. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased by 10 and 12 , respectively, over the same periods of 2023. In Bond Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased 8 over the same periods of 2023. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 increased by 10 and 12 , respectively, over the same periods of 2023. Factors contributing to the changes in earned premiums in each segment are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.

 Net investment income in the third quarter of 2024 was 904 million, 135 million or 18 higher than in the same period of 2023. Net investment income in the first nine months of 2024 was 2.64 billion, 491 million or 23 higher than in the same period of 2023. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 749 million and 2.15 billion, respectively, 118 million and 353 million higher, respectively, than in the same periods of 2023. The increases in both periods of 2024 primarily resulted from higher long-term average yields and a higher average level of fixed maturity investments. Net investment income from short-term securities in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 77 million and 217 million, respectively, 10 million and 48 million higher, respectively, than in the same periods of 2023.

average yields. The Company s remaining investment portfolios had net investment income of 90 million and 306 million, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, 8 million and 93 million higher, respectively, than in the same periods of 2023. The increases in both periods of 2024 primarily reflected higher private equity partnership returns. Included in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company s financial statements on a quarter lag basis. 
 Fee Income 
 Fee income in the third quarter of 2024 was 121 million, 9 million higher than in the same period of 2023. Fee income in the first nine months of 2024 was 345 million, 21 million higher than in the same period of 2023. The National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company s fee-based business and is discussed in the Business Insurance segment discussion that follows. 
 Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses) 
 The following table sets forth information regarding the Company s net realized investment gains (losses). 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Impairment gains (losses): Fixed maturities (5) (1) (8) (2) Net realized investment gains (losses) on equity securities still held 51 (14) 102 (11) Other net realized investment gains (losses), including from sales 9 (50) (69) (81) Total 55 (65) 25 (94) 
 Net realized investment gains on equity securities still held of 51 million and 102 million, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were driven by the impact of changes in fair value attributable to favorable equity markets. Net realized investment losses on equity securities still held of 14 million in the third quarter of 2023 were driven by the impact of changes in fair value attributable to unfavorable equity markets. Net realized investment losses on equity securities still held of 11 million in the first nine months of 2023 were driven by a net unfavorable change in fair value on the individual securities held in the Company s portfolio. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were 120 million, 19 million higher than in the same period of 2023. Other revenues in the first nine months of 2024 were 337 million, 62 million higher than in the same period of 2023. Other revenues include revenues from Simply Business, installment premium charges and other policyholder service charges. 
 Claims and Expenses 
 Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses 
 Claims and claim adjustment expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were 7.00 billion, 153 million or 2 lower than in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net favorable prior year reserve development compared to net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the same period of 2023 and (ii) lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses, lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line and lower non-weather water and fire losses in the homeowners and other product line in Personal Insurance, partially offset by (iii) higher business volumes, (iv) higher catastrophe losses and (v) loss cost trends in Business Insurance and Bond Specialty Insurance. Catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2024 primarily resulted from Hurricane Helene and severe wind and hail storms in multiple states. Catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2023 primarily resulted from numerous severe wind and hail storms in multiple states.

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were 21.03 billion, 690 million or 3 higher than in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher business volumes, (ii) higher catastrophe losses, (iii) loss cost trends and higher other losses in Business Insurance and (iv) loss cost trends in Bond Specialty Insurance, partially offset by (v) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, (vi) lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line, lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and lower non-weather water and fire losses in the homeowners and other product line in Personal Insurance and (vii) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in the same period of 2023 from both a small number of surety accounts and loss activity related to the disruption in the banking sector in Bond Specialty Insurance. Catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2024 included the third quarter events described above, as well as numerous severe wind and hail storms in multiple states in the first six months of 2024. Catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2023 included the third quarter events described above, as well as numerous severe wind and hail storms in multiple states in the first six months of 2023. 
 Factors contributing to net prior year reserve development during the third quarters and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Significant Catastrophe Losses 
 The following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant catastrophes that occurred in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2023 and 2022, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be 100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes. The Company s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level and for 2024 ranged from 20 million to 30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes. For the Company s definition of a catastrophe, refer to Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Overview in the Company s 2023 Annual Report.

 (1) Amounts are reported pre-tax and net of recoveries under all applicable reinsurance treaties, except for the Company s 2022 Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Treaty, the terms of which are described in Part I Item 1 Business in the Company s 2022 Annual Report. The treaty covered the accumulation of certain property losses arising from one or multiple occurrences (both catastrophe and non-catastrophe events) for the period January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022. As a result, the benefits from those treaties are not included in the table above as the allocation of the treaty s benefit to each identified catastrophe changes each time there are additional events or changes in estimated losses from any covered event. 
 Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs 
 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in the third quarter of 2024 was 1.79 billion, 186 million or 12 higher than in the same period of 2023.

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were 1.46 billion, 148 million or 11 higher than in the same period of 2023. General and administrative expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were 4.34 billion, 457 million or 12 higher than in the same period of 2023. The increases in both periods of 2024 primarily reflected the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes. General and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 98 million and 294 million, respectively, compared with 98 million and 278 million, respectively, in the same periods of 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Income tax expense in the third quarter of 2024 was 300 million, 232 million or 341 higher than in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the 1.09 billion increase in income before income taxes in the third quarter of 2024. Income tax expense in the first nine months of 2024 was 669 million, compared with an income tax benefit of 13 million in the same period of 2023. The change in income taxes primarily reflected the impact of the 2.23 billion increase in income before income taxes in the first nine months of 2024 and the one-time tax benefit of 211 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item. 
 The Company s effective tax rate was 19 and 14 in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate was 19 and (1) in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2023 was reduced by the impact of the one-time tax benefit discussed above. The effective tax rate for all periods reflected the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company s income tax provision. 
 Combined Ratio 
 The combined ratio of 93.2 in the third quarter of 2024 was 7.8 points lower than the combined ratio of 101.0 in the same period of 2023.

The underwriting expense ratio of 28.4 in the third quarter of 2024 was 0.4 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 28.0 in the same period of 2023. 
 Catastrophe losses in the third quarters of both 2024 and 2023 accounted for 8.8 points of the combined ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the third quarter of 2024 provided 1.2 points of benefit to the combined ratio. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the third quarter of 2023 accounted for 1.6 points of the combined ratio. The combined ratio excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses underlying combined ratio in the third quarter of 2024 was 5.0 points lower than the 2023 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the benefit of earned pricing and (ii) lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses, lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line and lower non-weather water and fire losses in the homeowners and other product line in Personal Insurance. 
 The combined ratio of 95.7 in the first nine months of 2024 was 5.3 points lower than the combined ratio of 101.0 in the same period of 2023. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.1 for the first nine months of 2024 was 5.5 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 72.6 in the same period of 2023. The underwriting expense ratio of 28.6 for the first nine months of 2024 was 0.2 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 28.4 in the same period of 2023. 
 Catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 accounted for 10.2 points and 10.3 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 provided 1.5 points and 0.1 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in the first nine months of 2024 was 3.8 points lower than the 2023 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the benefit of earned pricing, (ii) lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line, lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and lower non-weather water and fire losses in the homeowners and other product line in Personal Insurance and (iii) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in the same period of 2023 from both a small number of surety accounts and loss activity related to the disruption in the banking sector in Bond Specialty Insurance, partially offset by (iv) higher other losses in Business Insurance. 
 The combined ratio continues to be impacted by the tort environment, including more aggressive attorney involvement in insurance claims.

 Claims and Expenses 
 Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses 
 Claims and claim adjustment expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were 441 million, 90 million or 26 higher than in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) higher business volumes and (iii) loss cost trends. 
 Claims and claim adjustment expenses in the first nine months of 2024 were 1.34 billion, 245 million or 22 higher than in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) higher business volumes, (iii) loss cost trends and (iv) higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (v) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in the same period of 2023 from both a small number of surety accounts and loss activity related to the disruption in the banking sector. 
 Factors contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the third quarters and first nine months of 2024 and 2023 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.

 Overview 
 Segment income in the third quarter of 2024 was 384 million, compared with a segment loss of 193 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in segment income before income taxes was driven by the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher underlying underwriting margins, (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, (iii) lower catastrophe losses and (iv) higher net investment income. Catastrophe losses in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 595 million and 642 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 was 181 million and 37 million, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) the benefit of earned pricing, (ii) lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (iii) lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line, (iv) higher business volumes and (v) lower non-weather water and fire losses in the homeowners and other product line. The segment recorded income tax expense in the third quarter of 2024 compared with an income tax benefit in the same period of 2023. The change in income taxes primarily reflected the impact of the increase in segment income before income taxes. 
 Segment income in the first nine months of 2024 was 451 million, compared with a segment loss of 648 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in segment income before income taxes was driven by the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher underlying underwriting margins, (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (iii) higher net investment income, partially offset by (iv) higher catastrophe losses. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 420 million and 107 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 2.17 billion and 2.04 billion, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) the benefit of earned pricing, (ii) lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line, (iii) higher business volumes, (iv) lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and (v) lower non-weather water and fire losses in the homeowners and other product line. The segment recorded income tax expense in the first nine months of 2024 compared with an income tax benefit in the same period of 2023. The change in income taxes primarily reflected the impact of the increase in segment income before income taxes and a one-time tax benefit of 31 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION 
 The Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims. Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on defendants, such as manufacturers of talcum powder, who were not traditionally sued and/or primary targets of asbestos litigation. Many defendants have also been subject to increased settlement demands, in part due to the bankruptcy of many traditional primary targets of asbestos litigation. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company. The Company s asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. 
 The Company continues to be involved in disputes, including litigation, with a number of policyholders, some of whom are in bankruptcy, over coverage for asbestos-related claims. Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company, but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. Although the Company has seen a reduction in the overall risk associated with these disputes, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities. 
 In addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. It is possible that other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, could be filed in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions. 
 Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder with open claims at least annually. Among the factors the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder s potential liability, including as a result of the bankruptcy of other defendants; the jurisdictions involved, including any trends, judicial rulings or legislative actions in those jurisdictions; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; the potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. 
 The Company also reviews its asbestos reserves quarterly. These reviews include, as appropriate, an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders and the assumed reinsurance component of reserves, as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves, and the Company s evaluations have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of policyholders with open claims and litigation cases for potential product and non-product liability. While the latest available government data continue to reflect a declining trend in deaths caused by mesothelioma, the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims was relatively flat compared to 2023. Net asbestos payments were up compared to 2023, as described below. Payments on behalf of these policyholders continue to be influenced by the factors described above, including an increase in severity for certain policyholders and a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, primarily mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally sued and/or primary targets of asbestos litigation. The completion of the analyses described above and the annual review in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 resulted in 242 million and 284 million increases, respectively, to the Company s net asbestos reserves. In both 2024 and 2023, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company s estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders. The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs primarily resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the continued high level of mesothelioma claim filings and the impact of the current litigation environment surrounding those claims discussed above. The 2023 charge also includes an additional increase to strengthen the Company s carried reserve position relative to the range of reasonable estimates. 
 Over the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company s overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company s overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims. 
 Net asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 201 million and 156 million, respectively. Net asbestos reserves were 1.42 billion and 1.43 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION 
 The Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of the alleged storage, emissions or disposal of toxic substances, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These claims are mainly brought pursuant to various state or federal statutes that require a liable party to undertake or pay for environmental remediation. For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under these statutes may be joint and several with other responsible parties. The Company has also been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions pertaining to environmental claims have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. 
 In establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of its analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. The evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. Conventional actuarial methods are not used to estimate these reserves.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time, the number of policyholders with open environmental claims and the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. These policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, are involved in fewer hazardous waste sites and are lower tier defendants than policyholders presenting such claims in the past. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated. In addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims as well as the costs associated with coverage litigation on environmental matters has been greater than anticipated, driven by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As a result of these factors, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by 21 million and 58 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and by 26 million and 74 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Net environmental paid loss and loss expenses in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 53 million and 63 million, respectively. Net environmental reserves were 387 million and 382 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES 
 As a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management s judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation: 
 the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation; 
 a further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated; 
 the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements; 
 the role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued; 
 the resolution or adjudication of disputes concerning coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with our previous assessment of these disputes; 
 the number and outcome of direct actions against us; 
 future developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims; 
 any impact on asbestos defendants we insure due to the bankruptcy of other asbestos defendants; 
 the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers; and 
 uncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders. 
 Changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment may impact the future resolution of asbestos and environmental claims and result in adverse loss reserve development. The emergence of a greater number of asbestos or environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated may result in adverse loss reserve development. Changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims, could affect the settlement of asbestos and environmental claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments. 
 Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company s current reserves. In addition, the Company s estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company s operating results in future periods.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 
 The Company s invested assets at September 30, 2024 were 95.45 billion, of which 94 was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1 in equity securities, 1 in real estate investments and 4 in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on appropriate risk-adjusted returns. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. 
 The carrying value of the Company s fixed maturity portfolio at September 30, 2024 was 83.99 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company s insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the Company s fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was Aa2 at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Below investment grade securities represented 1.2 and 1.3 of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.1 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at September 30, 2024 and 4.1 (4.4 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2023. 
 Obligations of U.S. States, Municipalities and Political Subdivisions 
 The Company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included 28.10 billion and 28.51 billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of U.S. states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 835 million and 966 million, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which U.S. states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities. These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds. The irrevocable trusts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the underwriter, issuer or trustee. All of the Company s holdings of securities issued by Puerto Rico and related entities have either been pre-refunded and therefore are defeased by U.S. Treasury securities or have FHA guarantees subject to federal appropriation. 
 The Company bases its investment decision on the underlying credit characteristics of the municipal security. The weighted average credit rating of the municipal bond portfolio was Aaa/Aa1 at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Mortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities 
 The Company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included 12.00 billion and 7.82 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company s inv estment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. Included in the totals at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 9.33 billion and 6.23 billion, respectively, of GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC (excluding FHA project loans) and Canadian government guaranteed residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities classified as available for sale. Also included in those totals were residential CMOs classified as available for sale with a fair value of 2.67 billion and 1.59 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Approximately 40 and 33 of the Company s CMO holdings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC. The weighted average credit rating of the 1.59 billion and 1.07 billion of non-guaranteed CMO holdings was Aaa at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The weighted average credit rating of all of the above securities was Aaa/Aa1 at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For further discussion regarding the Company s investments in residential CMOs, see Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment Portfolio in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. 
 Equity Securities, Real Estate and Short-Term Investments

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

Other Investments 
 The Company also invests in private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships, and joint ventures. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than investments in fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company s other investments was 4.38 billion and 4.30 billion, respectively. 
 Investments in private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships are accounted for under the equity method of accounting an d typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income from these other i nvestments is generally reflected in the Company s financial statements on a quarter lag basis. 

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE 
 The Company s normal renewals and changes to its catastrophe reinsurance coverage occur in January and July each year. The changes effective in January of 2024 are discussed in the Catastrophe Reinsurance section of Part I Item 1 Business in the Company s 2023 Annual Report, and changes effective in July of 2024 are discussed in the Catastrophe Reinsurance Coverage section of Part I Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company regularly reviews its catastrophe reinsurance coverage and may adjust such coverage in the future. 

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES 
 The Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. For a description of the Company s reinsurance recoverables, refer to Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reinsurance Recoverables in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. 
 The following table summarizes the composition of the Company s reinsurance recoverables: 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses 4,026 3,895 Gross structured settlements 2,642 2,707 Mandatory pools and associations 1,527 1,659 Gross reinsurance recoverables 8,195 8,261 Allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance (120) (118) Net reinsurance recoverables 8,075 8,143 
 Net reinsurance recoverables at September 30, 2024 decreased by 68 million from December 31, 2023. 
 
 OUTLOOK 
 The following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company s results of operations and capital position. 
 Premiums. The Company s earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured). Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Net written premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Overall, the Company expects that retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. 
 56 

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 for new business. In each of the Company s business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, despite its positive impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact the combined ratio for a period of time. In periods of meaningful decreases in new business, despite its negative impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of lower new business levels may positively impact the combined ratio for a period of time. 
 Effective January 1, 2024, the Company renewed a quota share reinsurance agreement with subsidiaries of Fidelis Insurance Holdings Limited (Fidelis) pursuant to which the Company assumes 20 of the gross written premiums of Fidelis during 2024, subject to a loss ratio cap. The Company s portion of premiums from Fidelis is reported as part of the International results of Business Insurance. The Company also has a minority investment in Fidelis. 
 Underwriting Gain/Loss. The Company s underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins. Underlying underwriting margins can be impacted by a number of factors, including variability in non-catastrophe weather, large loss and other loss activity; changes in current period loss estimates resulting from prior period loss development; changes in loss cost trends; changes in business mix; changes in reinsurance coverages and/or costs; premium adjustments; and variability in expenses and assessments. 
 Catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company s results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur. 
 On average for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2023, the Company experienced approximately 40 of its annual catastrophe losses during the second quarter, primarily arising out of severe wind and hail storms, including tornadoes. Hurricanes, wildfires and winter storms tend to happen at other times of the year and can also have a material impact on the Company s results of operations. Catastrophe losses incurred in a particular quarter in any given year may differ materially from historical experience. In addition, most of the Company s reinsurance programs renew on January 1 or July 1 of each year, and, therefore, any changes to the availability, cost or coverage terms of such programs will be effective after such dates. 
 The Company s preliminary estimate related to Hurricane Milton, which made landfall in Florida on October 9th, is a range of approximately 75 million to 175 million of incurred losses in the fourth quarter of 2024, after reinsurance and before taxes. 
 Over much of the past decade, the Company s results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience. However, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes in future periods higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year. 
 It is possible that changes in economic conditions, the supply chain, the labor market and geopolitical tensions, as well as steps taken by federal, state and/or local governments and the Federal Reserve could lead to higher or lower inflation than the Company anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase or decrease in the Company s loss costs and the need to strengthen or reduce claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. These impacts of inflation on loss costs and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those lines of business that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and, accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. For a further discussion, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. 
 The Company s results of operations may be impacted by a number of other factors, including an economic slowdown, a recession, financial market volatility, monetary and fiscal policy measures, heightened geopolitical tensions, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the political and regulatory environment, changes to the U.S. Federal budget and potential changes in tax laws. 
 57 

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

Investment Portfolio. The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.1 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at September 30, 2024. From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Company regularly evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company s investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal, taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. 
 The Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate and private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships, and joint ventures. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for greater volatility and higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity. 
 Approximately 33 of the fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years (including the early redemption of bonds, assuming interest rates (including credit spreads) do not rise significantly by applicable call dates). As a result, the overall yield on and composition of its portfolio could be meaningfully impacted by the types of investments available for reinvestment with the proceeds of maturing bonds. 
 Net investment income is a material contributor to the Company s results of operations. Based on our current expectations for the impact of expected higher reinvestment yields on fixed income investments and higher levels of fixed income investments, the Company expects that after-tax net investment income from that portfolio will be approximately 700 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, and the Company also currently expects that after-tax net investment income from that portfolio will be approximately 700 million in the first quarter of 2025 and growing to approximately 760 million in the fourth quarter of 2025. This expectation could be impacted by the direction of interest rates and disruptions in global financial markets. Included in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income or loss from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company s financial statements on a quarter lag basis. The Company s net investment income in future periods from its non-fixed income investment portfolio will be impacted, positively or negatively, by the performance of global financial markets. 
 The Company had net pre-tax realized investment gains of 25 million in the first nine months of 2024. Changes in global financial markets could result in net realized investment gains or losses in the Company s investment portfolio. 
 The Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of 2.67 billion 2.11 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at September 30, 2024, compared to 3.97 billion 3.13 billion after-tax) at December 31, 2023. The net unrealized investment loss is primarily due to the impact of movements in interest rates. The decrease in the net unrealized investment loss in the first nine months of 2024 was due to decreases in interest rates. While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment reduces the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduces shareholders equity, and a declining interest rate environment has the opposite effects. The net unrealized loss discussed above is considered temporary in nature as it is not due to credit impairments, there is no impact on expected contractual cash flows from fixed maturities, and the Company generally holds its fixed maturity investments to maturity. In addition, given the temporary nature of net unrealized losses combined with the Company s strong operating cash flows (which include income received on investments) and the proceeds received upon maturity of the investments, the net unrealized investment loss is not expected to meaningfully impact the Company s assessment of capital adequacy or liquidity. Equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 
 Additionally, disruptions in global financial markets could also impact the market value of the Company s investment portfolio. The Company s investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of the Company s investment portfolio. See Our businesses are heavily regulated by the states and countries in which we conduct business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes in regulation, including changes in tax regulation, may reduce our profitability and limit our growth included in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company s 2023 Annual Report.

be materially and adversely affected and Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses included in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. For a discussion of the risks to the Company s investments from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see the risk factor entitled We are subject to additional risks associated with our business outside the United States included in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company s 2023 Annual Report and see Part II Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. 
 Capital Position . The Company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value, expects to continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders, subject to the considerations described below. The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income. The Company also expects that to the extent that it continues to grow premium volumes, the level of capital to support the Company s financial strength ratings will also increase, and accordingly, the amount of capital returned to shareholders relative to earnings would be somewhat less than it otherwise would have been absent the growth in premium volumes. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of additional factors, including the Company s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company s business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws (including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and other factors. For information regarding the Company s common share repurchases in 2024, see Liquidity and Capital Resources herein. 
 As a result of the Company s business outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom (including Lloyd s), the Republic of Ireland and in Brazil through a joint venture, the Company s capital is also subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in a reduction in shareholders equity, while a weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in an increase in shareholders equity. For additional discussion of the Company s foreign exchange market risk exposure, see Part II Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. 
 Many of the statements in this Outlook section and in Liquidity and Capital Resources are forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company s control. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Further, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update them. See Part II Item 7 Forward-Looking Statements. For a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company s results of operations or financial position, see Part I Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors and Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s 2023 Annual Report, in each case as updated by the Company s periodic filings with the SEC. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations and to satisfy general corporate purposes when needed. 
 Operating Company Liquidity. The liquidity requirements of the Company s insurance subsidiaries are met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, income received on investments and investment maturities. The Company believes that cash flows from operating activities are sufficient to meet the future liquidity requirements of its insurance subsidiaries. Additionally, investment maturities provide a significant level of available liquidity without requiring the sale of investment securities. For further discussion of operating company liquidity, see Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. 
 Holding Company Liquidity . TRV s liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt servicing, common share repurchases and, from time to time, contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. At September 30, 2024, TRV held total cash and short-term invested assets in the United States aggregating 1.82 billion and having a weighted average maturity of 20 days. TRV has established a holding company liquidity target equal to its estimated annual pre-tax interest expense and common shareholder dividends (currently approximately 1.33 billion). TRV s holding company liquidity of 
 59 

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 
 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

1.82 billion at September 30, 2024 exceeded this target, and it is the opinion of the Company s management that these assets are sufficient to meet TRV s current liquidity requirements. 
 TRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company s foreign operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company s financial position or liquidity at September 30, 2024. 
 TRV has a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that expires on June 8, 2025 which permits it to issue securities from time to time. TRV also has a 1.0 billion credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 15, 2027. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 100 million of commercial paper outstanding. TRV is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs. The Company has no senior notes or junior subordinated debentures maturing until April 2026, at which time 200 million of senior notes will mature. 
 The Company utilized uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of 260 million to provide a portion of the capital needed to support its obligations at Lloyd s at September 30, 2024. If uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the Company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at Lloyd s, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 7.01 billion and 5.61 billion, respectively. The increase in cash flows in the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflected the impacts of higher levels of cash received for premiums, partially offset by higher levels of payments for income taxes, general and administrative expenses, commissions and claims and claim adjustments expenses. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 5.57 billion and 5.04 billion, respectively. The Company s consolidated total investments at September 30, 2024 increased by 6.64 billion, or 7 , over year-end 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net cash flows provided by operating activities and (ii) lower net unrealized investment losses due to the impact of lower interest rates during the first nine months of 2024, partially offset by (iii) net cash used in financing activities and (iv) the cost of acquiring Corvus. 
 The Company s investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly, the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders. As such, the primary goals of the Company s asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Company s fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company s insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company s ability to fund claim payments without having to sell assets at a loss or access credit facilities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was 1.33 billion and 778 million, respectively. The totals in both 2024 and 2023 reflected common share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Common share repurchases in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 859 million and 957 million, respectively. 
 Dividends . Dividends paid to shareholders were 711 million and 676 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company s common stock will be at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company s financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the Company s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company. On October 17, 2024, the Company announced that it declared a regular quarterly dividend of 1.05 per share, payable December 31, 2024 to shareholders of record on December 10, 2024. 
 Share Repurchases . The Company s Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

stated expiration date. The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income. The Company also expects that to the extent that it continues to grow premium volumes, the amount of capital returned to shareholders relative to earnings would be somewhat less than it otherwise would have been absent the growth in premium volumes. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company s business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws (including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and other factors. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1.1 million and 3.4 million common shares, respectively, under its share repurchase authorizations for a total cost of 250 million and 750 million, respectively. The average cost per share repurchased was 222.58 and 216.94, respectively. On April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization that added 5.0 billion of repurchase capacity to the 1.60 billion of capacity remaining at that date. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 5.29 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorizations. Included in the cost of treasury stock acquired pursuant to common share repurchases is the 1 excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. 
 Capital Resources . Capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the Company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs. The following table summarizes the components of the Company s capital structure at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Debt: Short-term 100 100 Long-term 8,004 8,004 Net unamortized fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs (71) (73) Total debt 8,033 8,031 Shareholders equity: Common stock and retained earnings, less treasury stock 31,129 29,392 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (3,433) (4,471) Total shareholders equity 27,696 24,921 Total capitalization 35,729 32,952 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization presented in the foregoing table to total capitalization excluding net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders equity. 
 (dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total capitalization 35,729 32,952 Less: net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders equity (2,111) (3,129) Total capitalization excluding net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders equity 37,840 36,081 Debt-to-total capital ratio 22.5 24.4 Debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders equity 21.2 22.3 
 The debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders equity, is calculated by dividing (a) debt by (b) total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders equity. Net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both interest rate movements and other economic factors. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company s management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the Company s financial leverage position. The Company s ratio of debt-to-total capital excluding after-tax net unrealized investment losses included in shareholders equity of 21.2 at September 30, 2024 was within the Company s target range of 15 to 25 .

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued 

RATINGS 
 Ratings are an important factor in assessing the Company s competitive position in the insurance industry. The Company receives ratings from the following major rating agencies: A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) and S P Global Ratings (S P). The following rating agency action was taken with respect to the Company since July 19, 2024, the date on which the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was filed with the SEC. For additional discussion of ratings, see Part I Item 1 Business Ratings in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. 
 On August 2, 2024, A.M. Best affirmed all ratings of the Company. The outlook for all ratings is stable. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 For a description of the Company s critical accounting estimates, refer to Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. The Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, and impairments of investments, goodwill and other intangible assets. Except as shown in the table below, there have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023. 
 Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves 
 The table below displays the Company s gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line. Because establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates and the application of judgment, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. These changes in estimates could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company s operating results in future periods. In particular, a portion of the Company s gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling 2.22 billion at September 30, 2024) are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. Asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi-peril and International and other lines in the summary table below. While the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Company s management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current insurance reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company s future operating results. Asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately; see Asbestos Claims and Litigation , Environmental Claims and Litigation and Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves in this report.

Gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows:

 29,289 35,457 64,746 28,992 32,635 61,627 
 The 3.12 billion increase in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since December 31, 2023 primarily reflected the impacts of (i) catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2024, (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures and (iii) loss cost trends for the current accident year, partially offset by (iv) claim payments made during the first nine months of 2024 and (v) net favorable prior year reserve development.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains, and management may make, certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. Words such as may, will, should, likely, probably, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, projects, believes, views, ensures, estimates and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements include, among other things, the Company s statements about: 
 the Company s outlook, the impact of trends on its business and its future results of operations and financial condition (including, among other things, anticipated premium volume, premium rates, renewal premium changes, underwriting margins and underlying underwriting margins, net and core income, investment income and performance, loss costs, return on equity, core return on equity and expected current returns, and combined ratios and underlying combined ratios); 
 the impact of legislative or regulatory actions or court decisions; 
 share repurchase plans; 
 future pension plan contributions; 
 the sufficiency of the Company s reserves, including asbestos; 
 the impact of emerging claims issues as well as other insurance and non-insurance litigation; 
 the cost and availability of reinsurance coverage; 
 catastrophe losses and modeling, including statements about probabilities or likelihood of exceedance; 
 the impact of investment (including changes in interest rates), economic (including inflation, changes in tax laws, changes in commodity prices and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates) and underwriting market conditions; 
 the Company s approach to managing its investment portfolio; 
 the impact of changing climate conditions; 
 strategic and operational initiatives to improve growth, profitability and competitiveness; 
 the Company s competitive advantages and innovation agenda, including executing on that agenda with respect to artificial intelligence; 
 the Company s cybersecurity policies and practices; 
 new product offerings; 
 the impact of developments in the tort environment, such as increased attorney involvement in insurance claims; 
 the impact of developments in the geopolitical environment; and 
 the impact of the Company s acquisition of Corvus Insurance Holdings, Inc. 
 The Company cautions investors that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the Company s control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. 
 Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Insurance-Related Risks 
 high levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas and changing climate conditions, could materially and adversely affect the Company s results of operations, its financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact the Company s ratings, the Company s ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance; 
 if actual claims exceed the Company s claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, including increased inflation, the Company s financial results could be materially and adversely affected; 
 the Company s business could be harmed because of its potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation; 
 the Company is exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances; and 
 the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the Company s business are uncertain, and court decisions or legislative changes that take place after the Company issues its policies can result in an unexpected increase in the number of claims and have a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations and/or the Company s financial position. 
 64 

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, Continued 

 Financial, Economic and Credit Risks 
 during or following a period of financial market disruption or an economic downturn, the Company s business could be materially and adversely affected; 
 the Company s investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses; 
 the Company may not be able to collect all amounts due to it from reinsurers, reinsurance coverage may not be available to the Company in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all and the Company is exposed to credit risk related to its structured settlements; 
 the Company is exposed to credit risk in certain of its insurance operations and with respect to certain guarantee or indemnification arrangements that it has with third parties; 
 a downgrade in the Company s claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact the Company s business volumes, adversely impact the Company s ability to access the capital markets and increase the Company s borrowing costs; and 
 the inability of the Company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company s holding company in sufficient amounts would harm the Company s ability to meet its obligations, pay future shareholder dividends and/or make future share repurchases. 
 Business and Operational Risks 
 the intense competition that the Company faces, including with respect to attracting and retaining employees, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which it operates, could harm its ability to maintain or increase its business volumes and its profitability; 
 disruptions to the Company s relationships with its independent agents and brokers or the Company s inability to manage effectively a changing distribution landscape could adversely affect the Company; 
 the Company s efforts to develop new products or services, expand in targeted markets, improve business processes and workflows or make acquisitions may not be successful and may create enhanced risks; 
 the Company may be adversely affected if its pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results; 
 loss of or significant restrictions on the use of particular types of underwriting criteria, such as credit scoring, or other data or methodologies, in the pricing and underwriting of the Company s products could reduce the Company s future profitability; 
 the Company is subject to additional risks associated with its business outside the United States; and 
 future pandemics (including new variants of COVID-19) could materially affect the Company s results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. 
 Technology and Intellectual Property Risks 
 if, as a result of cyber attacks (the risk of which could be exacerbated by geopolitical tensions) or otherwise, the Company experiences difficulties with technology, data and network security, outsourcing relationships or cloud-based technology, the Company s ability to conduct its business could be negatively impacted; 
 the Company s business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology, including with respect to artificial intelligence, particularly as its business processes become more digital; and 
 intellectual property is important to the Company s business, and the Company may be unable to protect and enforce its own intellectual property or the Company may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property of others. 
 Regulatory and Compliance Risks 
 the Company s businesses are heavily regulated by the states and countries in which it conducts business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes in regulation, including changes in tax regulation, may reduce the Company s profitability and limit its growth; and 
 the Company could be adversely affected if its controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective. 
 In addition, the Company s share repurchase plans depend on a variety of factors, including the Company s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company s business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and

 acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws (including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and other factors. 
 The Company s forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the captions Part I Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein and Part I Item 1A Risk Factors and Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s 2023 Annual Report, in each case as updated by the Company s periodic filings with the SEC. 

WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA DISCLOSURE

Financial and other important information regarding the Company is routinely posted on and accessible through the Company s website at investor.travelers.com , its Facebook page at facebook.com/travelers and its X account (@Travelers) at twitter.com/Travelers .

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 For the Company s disclosures about market risk, please see Part II Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the Company s 2023 Annual Report filed with the SEC. There have been no material changes to the Company s disclosures about market risk in Part II Item 7A of the Company s 2023 Annual Report. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, management is excluding an assessment of such internal controls for Corvus Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Corvus) from its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Corvus on January 2, 2024. Corvus represented less than 1 of the Company s consolidated total assets, consolidated total revenues and net income as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company moved to a new payment processing platform with a third-party provider for premium collection of automated clearing house (ACH) and credit card payments, which has resulted in certain changes to business processes and internal control over financial reporting. Other than this change to the new payment processing platform, there were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed and tested the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting related to the change to the new payment processing platform and concluded they were effective. The Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of Corvus and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as it integrates Corvus into the Company s overall internal control over financial reporting. 
 The Company regularly seeks to identify, develop, and implement improvements to its technology systems and business processes, some of which may affect its internal control over financial reporting. These changes may include activities such as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems or platforms, automating manual processes, or utilizing

technology developed by third parties. These systems changes are often phased in over multiple periods in order to limit the implementation risk in any one period, and as each change is implemented the Company monitors its effectiveness as part of its internal control over financial reporting.

 The Company s Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The most recent authorization was approved by the Board of Directors on April 19, 2023 and added 5.0 billion of repurchase capacity to the 1.60 billion of capacity remaining at that date. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company s business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws (including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and other factors. The cost of treasury stock acquired pursuant to common share repurchases includes the 1 excise tax imposed on common share repurchase activity, net of common share issuances, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. 
 
 The Company acquired 14,298 shares for a total cost of 3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that were not part of its publicly announced share repurchase authorizations. These shares consisted of shares retained to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and shares used by employees to cover the exercise price, as well as the related payroll withholding taxes, with respect to certain stock options that were exercised.
