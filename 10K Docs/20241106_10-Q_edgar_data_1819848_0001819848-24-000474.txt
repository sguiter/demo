 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management of Joby Aviation, Inc. (the Company, Joby, we, us or our ). These statements constitute projections and forecasts and are not guarantees of performance. Such statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. When used in this Quarterly Report, words such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, strive, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this Quarterly Report and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. While we believe these expectations, forecasts, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, our forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and the price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those discussed in this Quarterly Report in Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the section titled Risk Factors below in Part II, Item 1A and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024 . Any one or more of these factors could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. 
 As a result of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, our actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

 shares of the Company s common stock with an aggregate acquisition date fair value of million. The transaction is expected to contribute to development of autonomous capabilities of the Company s aircraft and to accelerate the execution of the Company s contract deliverables with the U.S. Department of Defense. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination as the assets acquired constituted a business in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations . 
 As part of the acquisition, the Company also issued shares of the Company common stock subject to lock-up period of twelve month following the acquisition date Holdback Equity ). The number of shares of Holdback Equity to be released at the end of the lock-up period depends on the continuing employment of selected employees of the aerospace company, whose employment transitioned to the Company as a result of the acquisition, and the weighted volume average price of the Company s common stock at the end of the lock-up period. The number of shares of Holdback Equity to be

 million as stock-based compensation expense over the lock-up period, commencing on the acquisition date. 
 The purchase consideration of million was preliminarily allocated to million of total intangible assets comprising of million of acquired developed technology and million of contractual assets, million of acquired fixed assets comprising of aircraft, related equipment and other long lived assets, million of acquired goodwill, and million of acquired current assets. 
 The acquired goodwill is not tax deductible. It represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the aggregate preliminary fair value of identifiable assets acquired at the acquisition date and is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and expected synergies at the time of the acquisition. 
 The fair values of the acquired assets are still provisional and subject to change within the measurement period. The final determination of the fair values of the acquired assets is expected to be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

 million of unconditional purchase obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year. These obligations primarily relate to the Company s purchase agreements for certain aircraft parts through 2028. 
 The Company is subject to claims and assessments from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Accruals for litigation and contingencies are reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements based on management s assessment, including the advice of legal counsel, of the expected outcome of litigation or other dispute resolution proceedings and/or the expected resolution of contingencies. Liabilities for estimated losses are accrued if the potential losses from any claims or legal proceedings are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability of loss and the determination as to whether the amount can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based only on information available at the time of the assessment due to the uncertain nature of such matters. As additional information becomes available, management reassesses potential liabilities related to pending claims and litigation and may revise its previous estimates, which could materially affect the Company s condensed consolidated results of operations in a given period. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company was not involved in any material legal proceedings. 
 Indemnifications 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. The Company s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but that have not yet been made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations. However, the Company may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain from change in the fair value of private warrants was million and a loss of million, respectively.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the public warrant liability was remeasured to fair value based upon the market price as of September 30, 2024, resulting in a loss of million and a gain of million, respectively, classified within the gain (loss) from change in the fair value of warrants and earnout shares in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the gain from change in the fair value of public warrants was million and a loss of million, respectively. 
 Earnout Shares Liability 
 In connection with the Reverse Recapitalization and pursuant to the Sponsor Agreement, Sponsor agreed to certain terms of vesting, lock-up and transfer with respect to the common shares held by it Earnout Shares ). The terms of the Sponsor Agreement specify that the Earnout Shares will vest upon achieving certain specified release events. In accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging , the Earnout Shares are not indexed to the Common Stock and therefore are accounted for as a liability Earnout Shares Liability as of the Closing Date and subsequently remeasured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of total other income (loss), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Under the vesting schedule, of the Earnout Shares vest in tranches when the volume-weighted average price of the Company s common stock quoted on the NYSE is greater than , , , and for any trading days within a period of trading days (each such occurrence a Triggering Event ). After following the consummation of the Merger (the Earnout Period ), any Earnout Shares which have not yet vested are forfeited. Earnout Shares vested as of September 30, 2024. 
 Earnout Shares Liability at the closing of the Merger on August 10, 2021, was million based on a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model using a distribution of potential outcomes on a monthly basis over the Earnout Period using the most reliable information available.

The number of shares and exercise price for both tranches is subject to value cap adjustment if the day volume weighted average price per share of the Company s stock exceeds of each respective tranche s exercise price, but disregarding any price increases occurring within business days after a public announcement of the achievement of an applicable milestone, if any. 
 The Company concluded that no assets or liabilities were transferred by either party beyond the Company s issuance of common stock and warrants in exchange for the total cash consideration from Delta, that the umbrella agreement does not constitute a funded research and development agreement in the scope of ASC 730 Research and Development or a collaborative agreement in the scope of ASC 808 Collaborative Agreements , and that the Delta Warrant is a freestanding financial instrument not indexed to the Company s own stock. Accordingly, the Company recognized the issuance of Common Stock as equity in additional paid-in capital on condensed consolidated balance sheets and the Delta Warrant as liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value. 
 The Delta Warrant issuance was initially recognized as a liability on October 7, 2022, at a fair value of million based on a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model using the most reliable information available. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Delta Warrant s liability was remeasured to fair value as of September 30, 2024, resulting in a gain of million and million, respectively, which is included within the gain (loss) from change in the fair value of warrants and earnout shares in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 On February 27, 2023, the Company s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors Compensation Committee approved a performance-based bonus program under which RSUs were awarded in connection with the achievement of specified goals in 2023 2023 Bonus Plan ). The RSU awards were granted when the achievement of each goal was approved by the Compensation Committee in 2023, and the RSUs vested in equal installments in each of January, February, March and April 2024 provided the employee or consultant continued to be a service provider through the relevant vesting dates. The target bonus opportunity was equal to of the employee s base salary as of the applicable grant date, with stretch bonus goals that are one-third higher than the target amounts unless otherwise established by the Compensation Committee. In accordance with ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation , awards under 2023 Bonus Plan were classified as a liability until such time that the respective milestones were met, at which point the liability was reclassified to equity. If it was determined that the milestone could not be met, the liability was reversed. 
 On February 12, 2024, the Compensation Committee approved a performance-based program under which RSUs are awarded. Each RSU represents the right to receive, upon vesting, up to shares of the Company s common stock, based on the achievement of certain specified objectives tied to five goals during 2024 2024 Bonus Plan ). Each goal has criteria for achievement of a minimum, target or maximum achievement level, expressed as a percentage, and the amount of the awards that will vest is calculated by summing the actual achievement percentages as of December 31, 2024. The maximum possible amount that will vest is . If exactly the minimum or target levels are achieved, and of the awards, respectively, will vest. The RSUs awarded under the 2024 Bonus Plan will vest in equal installments on each of January 14, 2025, February 10, 2025, March 4, 2025 and April 7, 2025, subject in each case to the participant s continued status as a service provider through respective vesting date. In accordance with ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation , the Company has determined that 2024 Bonus Plan awards are equity awards with performance condition, and classified them as an equity. 
 In June 2023, the Compensation Committee approved long-term incentive performance-based RSU awards LTI Awards to certain employees of the Company. The LTI Awards vest in a single installment on June 21, 2026, provided that (i) certain performance conditions are met on or prior to that date and (ii) the employee continues to be a service provider through the vesting date. The Company considers the probability of achieving each of the performance goals at the end of each reporting period and recognizes expense over the requisite service period when achievement of the goal is determined to be probable, and adjusts the expense if the probability of achieving the goal later changes.

In accordance with ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation , Management has determined that these LPA awards are equity awards with performance and service conditions, and classified them as an equity. 
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 On August 10, 2021, the Company adopted the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2021 ESPP ). Under the 2021 ESPP, participating employees may be offered the option to purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock at a purchase price which equals of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the enrollment date or on the exercise date, whichever is lower. Under the terms of 2021 ESPP, if the closing price of the Company s shares on the exercise date falls below the closing price of the Company s shares on the enrollment date for an ongoing offering, the ongoing offering will terminate immediately following the purchase of ESPP shares on the exercise date and participants in the terminated offering would automatically be enrolled in the new offering ESPP Reset ), potentially resulting in an additional modification to stock-based compensation expense to be recognized over the new offering period. 
 Due to the changes in the Company s stock price, an ESPP Reset occurred in May 2024, resulting in incremental stock-based compensation expense to be recognized over the offering period ending May 2025. 
 The number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2021 ESPP will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2022, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) a number of shares of common stock equal to half percent of the total number of shares of all classes of common stock of the Company on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (ii) such number of shares determined by the Company s Board of Directors, On January 1, 2024, the number of shares available for issuance under 2021 ESPP increased by shares.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis provides information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read together with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We have spent more than a decade designing and testing a piloted all-electric, vertical take-off and landing eVTOL aircraft that we intend to operate as part of a fast, quiet and convenient service in cities around the world. The aircraft is quiet when taking off, near silent when flying overhead and is designed to transport a pilot and four passengers at speeds of up to 200 mph, with a range optimized for urban routes of up to 100 miles on a single charge and an expected payload of 1,000 pounds. According to our modeling, more than 99 of urban routes in cities such as New York City and Los Angeles are significantly shorter than this, enabling higher utilization through faster turnaround times of our aircraft. By combining the freedom of air travel with the efficiency of our aircraft, we expect to deliver journeys that are up to 10 times faster than driving, and it is our goal to steadily drive down end-user pricing in the years following commercial launch to make the service widely accessible. The low noise enabled by the all-electric powertrain will allow the aircraft to operate around dense, urban areas while blending into the background noise of cities. With more than 1,000 successful test flights already completed, and as the first eVTOL aircraft developer to receive a signed, stage 4 G-1 certification basis which was subsequently published in final form in the Federal Register, we believe we are well positioned to be the first eVTOL manufacturer to earn airworthiness certification from the Federal Aviation Administration FAA ). 
 We do not currently intend to sell these aircraft to independent third parties or individual consumers as a primary business model. Instead, we plan to manufacture, own and operate our aircraft, building a vertically integrated transportation company that will deliver transportation services to our customers, including government agencies such as the U.S. Air Force USAF through sales or contracted operations, and to individual end-users through a convenient app-based aerial ridesharing service. We delivered our first aircraft for initial service operations with the U.S Department of Defense DOD in September 2023 and are targeting initial commercial passenger operations as early as the end of 2025. We believe this vertically-integrated business model will generate the greatest economic returns over time, while providing us with end-to-end control over the customer experience to optimize for customer safety, comfort and value. There may be circumstances in which it is either required (for example, due to operating restrictions on foreign ownership in other countries) or otherwise desirable to sell aircraft in the future. We do not expect this would change our core focus on building a vertically integrated transportation company. 
 Since our inception in 2009, we have been primarily engaged in research and development of eVTOL aircraft. We have incurred net operating losses and negative cash flows from operations in every year since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1,609.5 million. We have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the issuance of stock, convertible notes and the proceeds from our merger in August 2021 with Reinvent Technology Partners RTP ), a special purpose acquisition company, through which we became a publicly-traded company. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company s business, please see the section entitled Risk Factors in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Development of the Global Urban Air Mobility UAM market 
 Our revenue will be directly tied to the continued development of short distance aerial transportation. While we believe the global market for UAM will be large, it remains undeveloped and there is no guarantee of future demand. We delivered our first aircraft for initial service operations with the DOD in September 2023 and are targeting commercial passenger operations as early as the end of 2025. Our business will require significant investment leading up to launching these services, including, but not limited to, final engineering designs, prototyping and testing, manufacturing, software development, certification, pilot training, infrastructure and commercialization. 
 We believe one of the primary drivers for adoption of our aerial ridesharing service is the value proposition and time savings offered by aerial mobility relative to traditional ground-based transportation. Additional factors impacting the pace of adoption of our aerial ridesharing service may include but are not limited to: perceptions about eVTOL quality, safety, performance and cost; perceptions about the limited range over which eVTOL may be flown on a single battery charge; 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline; availability of competing forms of transportation, such as ground, air taxi or ride-hailing services; the development of adequate infrastructure; consumers perception about the safety, convenience and cost of transportation using eVTOL relative to ground-based alternatives; and increases in fuel efficiency, autonomy, or electrification of cars. In addition, macroeconomic factors could impact demand for UAM services, particularly if end-user pricing is at a premium to ground-based transportation alternatives or more permanent work-from-home behaviors persist. We anticipate initial operations with our U.S. government customers to be followed by operations in selected high-density metropolitan areas where traffic congestion is particularly acute and operating conditions are suitable for early eVTOL operations. 
 Competition 
 We believe that the primary sources of competition for our service are ground-based mobility solutions, other eVTOL developers/operators and local/regional incumbent aircraft charter services. While we expect to be first to market with an eVTOL facilitated aerial ridesharing service, we expect this industry to be dynamic and increasingly competitive; and our competitors could get to market before us, either generally or in specific markets. Even if we are first to market, we may not receive any competitive advantage or may be overtaken by other competitors. If new or existing aerospace companies launch competing solutions in the markets in which we intend to operate or obtain large-scale capital investment, we may face increased competition. Additionally, our competitors may benefit from our efforts in developing consumer and community acceptance for eVTOL aircraft and aerial ridesharing, making it easier for them to obtain the permits and authorizations required to operate an aerial ridesharing service in the markets in which we intend to launch or in other markets. If we do not capture the first mover advantage that we anticipate, it may harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. For a more comprehensive discussion, please see the section entitled Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Government Certification 
 We signed a revised, stage 4 G-1 certification basis for our aircraft with the FAA in July 2022, which was published in final form in the Federal Register in March 2024. This agreement lays out the specific requirements that need to be met by our aircraft for it to be certified for commercial operations. Reaching this milestone marks a key step towards certifying any new aircraft in the U.S. We think of the FAA type certification process in five stages and have made significant progress towards certification. We have completed or substantially completed three of these five stages. 
 In 2022, we received our Part 135 operating certificate, which is required for us to operate an on-demand air service and allows us to operate the service with conventional aircraft. In October 2024, the FAA published the Special Federal Aviation Regulations SFARs ), which include operational regulations related to eVTOLs. We will need to comply with these SFARs as we add our aircraft to our Part 135 operating certificate. If the FAA requires further modifications to our existing G-1 certification basis, makes subsequent modifications to the SFARs, or if there are other regulatory changes or revisions, this could delay our ability to obtain type certification, and could delay our ability to launch our commercial passenger service. 
 We expect the FAA type certificate will be reciprocated in certain international markets pursuant to bilateral agreements between the FAA and its counterpart civil aviation authorities. In 2022, we applied for aircraft certification in the United Kingdom and Japan. In 2023, we signed an agreement with Road and Transport Authority of Dubai RTA for Joby to provide air taxi services in Dubai. The RTA agreement includes a roadmap for local approval by the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority that could precede type certification by the FAA. These arrangements provide a means of efficient international expansion as we develop commercial operations around the world. 
 In addition to certifying our aircraft, we will also need to obtain authorizations and certifications related to the production of our aircraft and the deployment of our aerial ridesharing service. We anticipate being able to meet the requirements of such authorizations and certifications. If we fail to obtain any of the required authorizations or certifications, or do so in a timely manner, or if any of these authorizations or certifications are modified, suspended or revoked after we obtain them, we may be unable to launch our commercial service or do so on the timelines we project, which would have adverse effects on our business, prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations. 
 U.S. Government Contracts 
 In December 2020, we became the first company to receive airworthiness approval for an eVTOL aircraft for a flight clearance from the USAF to conduct a government test, and in the first quarter of 2021 we officially began on-base operations under contract pursuant to the USAF s Agility Prime program. Our multi-year relationship with the DOD and other U.S. government agencies provides us with a compelling opportunity to more thoroughly understand the operational capabilities and maintenance profiles of our aircraft in advance of commercial launch. In addition to the operational 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 learnings and advanced research support, our contracts, which we expanded in July 2022 and again in April 2023, have a total potential value of more than 124 million through 2027. We are actively pursuing additional contracts and relationships with government agencies. Our U.S. government contracting parties may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts with us without prior notice, either at its convenience or for default based on performance, or may decline to accept performance or exercise subsequent option years. We may also be unable to secure additional contracts or continue to grow our relationship with the U.S. government and/or DOD. 
 Vertically-Integrated Business Model 
 Our business model is to serve as a vertically-integrated eVTOL transportation service provider. Present projections indicate that payback periods on aircraft will result in a viable business model over the long-term as production volumes scale and unit economics improve to support sufficient market adoption. As with any new industry and business model, numerous risks and uncertainties exist. Our projections are dependent on certifying and delivering aircraft on time and at a cost that will allow us to offer our service at prices that a sufficient number of customers will be willing to pay for the time and efficiency savings they receive from utilizing our eVTOL services. Our aircraft include parts and manufacturing processes unique to eVTOL aircraft, in general, and our product design, in particular. We have used our best efforts to estimate costs in our planning projections; however, the variable cost associated with assembling our aircraft at scale remains uncertain at this stage of development. Our vertically-integrated business model also relies, in part, on developing and certifying component parts rather than sourcing already certified parts from third-party suppliers. While we believe this model will ultimately result in a more performant aircraft and better operating economics, the increased time and effort required to develop and certify these components may result in delays compared to alternative approaches. Our vertically-integrated approach is also dependent on recruiting, developing and retaining the right talent at the right time to support engineering, certification, manufacturing, and go-to-market operations. As we progress through the certification process, we will have an increasing need to accelerate hiring in selected areas. If we are unable to add sufficient headcount it could impact our ability to meet our expected timelines for certification and entry into service. 
 The success of our business is also dependent, in part, on the utilization rate of our aircraft, which is the amount of time our aircraft spend in the air carrying passengers. We intend to maintain a high daily aircraft utilization rate, and reductions in utilization will adversely impact our financial performance. High daily aircraft utilization is achieved in part by reducing turnaround times at skyports. Aircraft utilization is reduced by delays and cancellations from various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, security requirements, air traffic congestion and unscheduled maintenance events. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Flight services 
 Flight services revenue primarily includes consideration received for our performance of customer-directed flights and on-base operations for various DOD agencies. We recognize revenue as we fulfill our performance obligations in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive. 
 Operating expenses 
 Flight services 
 Flight services expenses consist primarily of costs related to flight, flight support, and maintenance personnel, expenses associated with support aircraft such as rent and fuel, depreciation of capitalized ground support equipment, and our aircraft electricity cost, as directly attributed to our performance of the flight services. Flight services expenses do not include the costs of manufacturing our aircraft and aircraft parts as such costs are expensed when incurred as Research and Development Expenses (see below). 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, costs of consulting, equipment and materials, depreciation and amortization and allocations of overhead, including rent, information technology costs and utilities. Research and development expenses are partially offset by payments we received in the form of government grants, including those received under the Agility Prime program. 
 We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we increase staffing to support aircraft engineering and software development, build aircraft, and continue to explore and develop next generation aircraft and technologies.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, related to executive management, finance, legal, and human resource functions. Other costs include business development, contractor and professional services fees, audit and compliance expenses, insurance costs and general corporate expenses, including allocated depreciation, rent, information technology costs and utilities. 
 We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase as we hire additional personnel and consultants to support our operations and comply with applicable regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act SOX and other SEC rules and regulations. 

Gain (Loss) from changes in Fair Value of Warrants and Earnout Shares Liabilities 
 Publicly-traded warrants Public Warrants ), private placement warrants issued to Sponsor Private Placement Warrants and warrants issued to Delta Air Lines, Inc. Delta Warrants and shares of common stock owned by Sponsor subject to certain terms on vesting, lock-up and transfer Earnout Shares are recorded as liabilities and subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date. We expect to incur an incremental income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fair value adjustments for these outstanding liabilities at the end of each reporting period. 
 2024 Acquisitions 
 On May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of an aerospace company that develops modular autonomy technology for aviation in exchange for 1,944,990 shares of the Company s common stock with an aggregate acquisition date fair value of 9.5 million. The transaction is expected to contribute to development of autonomous capabilities of the Company s aircraft and to accelerate the execution of the Company s contract deliverables with the U.S. Department of Defense. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination as the assets acquired constituted a business in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations . 
 As part of the acquisition, the Company also issued 1,375,245 shares of the Company common stock subject to lock-up period of twelve month following the acquisition date Holdback Equity ). The number of shares of Holdback Equity to be released at the end of the lock-up period depends on the continuing employment of selected employees of the aerospace company, whose employment transitioned to the Company as a result of the acquisition, and the weighted volume average price of the Company s common stock at the end of the lock-up period. The number of shares of Holdback Equity to be released may additionally be reduced to satisfy certain indemnification obligations, if any, of the seller. The Company accounted for the Holdback Equity under ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation as a compensation arrangement separate from the business combination and will recognize 8.7 million as stock-based compensation expense over the lock-up period, commencing on the acquisition date. 
 The purchase consideration of 9.5 million was preliminarily allocated to 7.4 million of total intangible assets comprising of 6.9 million of acquired developed technology and 0.5 million of contract assets, 1.6 million of acquired fixed assets comprising of aircraft, related equipment and other long lived assets, 0.3 million of acquired goodwill, and 0.2 million of acquired current assets. 
 The acquired goodwill is not tax deductible. It represents the excess of the acquisition price over the preliminary fair value of identifiable assets acquired at the acquisition date and is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and expected synergies at the time of the acquisition. 
 The fair values of the acquired assets are still provisional and subject to change within the measurement period. The final determination of the fair values of the acquired assets is expected to be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. 
 Interest and Other Income, Net 
 Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Our provision for income taxes consists of an estimate of federal, state, and foreign income taxes based on enacted federal, state, and foreign tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in deferred tax 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 assets and liabilities, and changes in tax law. Due to the level of historical losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as it has been concluded it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized.

 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses increased by 89.8 million, or 34 , to 354.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 264.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel to support aircraft engineering, software development, prototype manufacturing, and certification, as well as increased quantity of materials used in prototype development and testing. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 13.2 million, or 17 , to 92.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 78.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased headcount to support operations growth, including IT, legal, facilities, HR, and finance, as well as an increase in professional services cost related to legal, accounting and recruiting support.

 Total Other Income, Net 
 Total other income, net increased by 139.7 million, or 259 , to a gain of 85.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a loss of 54.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 139.4 million change in the fair value of warrants and earnout shares from a loss of 86.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to a gain of 52.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We have incurred net losses and negative operating cash flows from operations since inception, and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future until we successfully commence sustainable commercial operations. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the Merger and issuance of stock and convertible notes. From inception through June 30, 2023, we raised net proceeds of 1,067.9 million from the Merger, 843.3 million from the issuances of Legacy Joby s redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible notes prior to the Merger, 60.0 million from issuance of shares and warrants to Delta Air Lines, Inc ., 180.2 million in net proceeds from our registered direct offering to certain institutional investors and net proceeds of 99.9 million from our issuance of shares to SKT. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 153.1 million and short-term investment in marketable securities of 557.7 million. Restricted cash, totaling 0.8 million, reflects cash temporarily retained for security deposit on leased facilities. On October 1, 2024, we entered a stock purchase agreement with Toyota Motor Corporation pursuant to which Toyota has committed to invest 500 million, subject to certain closing conditions, as described above in Note 11 Subsequent Events (the Toyota Investment ). We also raised approximately 221.8 million in estimated net proceeds from an underwritten public offering on October 28, 2024 (the Public Offering ). We believe that our cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments will satisfy our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 Long-Term Liquidity Requirements 
 We expect our cash and cash equivalents on hand together with the proceeds of the Public Offering, the expected proceeds from the Toyota Investment and cash we expect to generate from future operations will provide sufficient funding to support us beyond the initial launch of our commercial service operations. Until we generate sufficient operating cash flow to fully cover our operating expenses, working capital needs and planned capital expenditures, or if circumstances evolve differently than anticipated, we expect to utilize a combination of equity and debt financing to fund any future remaining capital needs. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders may result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of preferred and common stockholders. The terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The capital markets have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing. 
 Our principal uses of cash in recent periods were to fund our research and development activities, personnel cost and support services. Near-term cash requirements will also include spending on manufacturing facilities, ramping up production and supporting production certification, scaled manufacturing operations for commercialization, infrastructure and skyport development, pilot training facilities, software development and production of aircraft. We do not have material cash requirements related to current contractual obligations. As such, our cash requirements are highly dependent upon management s decisions about the pace and focus of both our short and long-term spending. 
 Cash requirements can fluctuate based on business decisions that could accelerate or defer spending, including the timing or pace of investments, infrastructure and production of aircraft. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, the timing and the amount of cash received from our customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities and the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, and technologies, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. If we require additional financing we may not be able to raise such financing on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to continue our research and development and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If adequate funds are not available, we may need to reconsider our investments in production operations, the pace of our production ramp-up, infrastructure investments in skyports, expansion plans or limit our research and development activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects and results of operations.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. 
 The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates applicable to our short-term investments. We had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments in short-term marketable securities totaling 710.7 million as of September 30, 2024. Cash equivalents and short-term investments were invested primarily in money market funds, U.S. treasury bills and government and corporate bonds. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity needs. Under the policy, we invest in highly rated securities, issued by the U.S. government and corporations or liquid money market funds. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of their investment policies. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments or our interest income. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are not exposed to significant foreign currency risks related to our operating expenses as our foreign operations are not material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to 
 materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are subject to a variety of claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or statement of cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were to occur, it may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and the price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described as risk factors, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual operating results and financial condition to vary materially from past, or anticipated future, operating results and financial condition. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company s business, please see the section entitled Risk Factors in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider material, could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and the price of our common stock. 
 The Toyota Investment is subject to closing conditions, including conditions beyond our control, and no assurance can be given that closing will take place on the timeline currently anticipated or at all. Any failure to close one or both of the tranches of the Toyota Investment could adversely impact our future liquidity and our financial condition. 
 
 On October 1, 2024, we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with Toyota providing for the potential issuance and sale of up to an aggregate of 99,403,579 shares of our common stock to Toyota (the Toyota Investment ). The Toyota Investment is structured in two equal tranches of 250.0 million each. The closing of each tranche is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. The first tranche is subject to conditions including, but not limited to: (i) the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals or clearances, including with respect to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (ii) the adoption of certain changes to the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws concerning the Foreign Ownership Requirement; (iii) the authorization by our board of directors of the Charter Amendment, subject to approval by our stockholders at our annual meeting in 2025; (iv) the execution of an amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement, dated August 30, 2019, between us and Toyota; (v) the execution of a services agreement by us and Toyota; and (vi) certain other customary closing conditions. The second tranche is subject to conditions including, but not limited to: (i) the execution of a strategic alliance agreement relating to, among other things, manufacturing arrangements, by us and Toyota; (ii) the approval of the Charter Amendment by our stockholders at our annual meeting in 2025; and (iii) certain other customary closing conditions. The agreements to be entered into in connection with such conditions are subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, the parties negotiating and entering into definitive agreements and the conditions included within the applicable definitive documents. 
 
 We may experience delays and difficulties in satisfying the conditions for closing on either or both of the tranches of the Toyota Investment, and no assurance can be given that closing will take place on the timeline currently anticipated or at all. Some of the conditions to closing are outside of our control and it is possible that not all of the closing conditions to the Toyota Investment will be satisfied or that we will not receive the entire amount of expected proceeds on the timeline currently anticipated or at all. For example, the Toyota Investment is subject to, among others, certain regulatory approvals and clearances and the approval of the Charter Amendment by our stockholders at our annual meeting in 2025. In addition, certain closing conditions require us and Toyota to successfully negotiate and enter into definitive agreements. The final terms of such definitive agreements are not yet established and the negotiation and execution of such agreements may take longer than expected or may not be possible to accomplish on terms acceptable to us, or at all. No assurance can be given that any agreement we may reach will achieve our goals or be on terms that prove to be economically or strategically beneficial to us. Such adverse developments, including any failure to close one or both of the tranches of the Toyota Investment, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

ARTICLE II TERMS 
 A. Term of this Agreement 
 The Agreement commences upon the date of the last signature hereon and continues based upon the delivery schedule set forth in Article V, paragraph A. Provisions of this Agreement, by which their express terms, or by necessary implication, apply for periods of time other than specified in Article V, paragraph A herein, shall be given effect, notwithstanding this Article. 
 
 B. Termination Provisions 
 Subject to a reasonable determination that the program, or a project funded under the program, will not produce beneficial results commensurate with the expenditure of resources, the Government may terminate performance of work under this OTA, in whole or in part, if the AO determines that a termination is in the Government s interest. The AO shall terminate by delivering to the Performer a Notice of Termination specifying the extent of termination and the effective date which shall be no earlier than sixty (60) days after such notice. 
 
 After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed by the AO, the Performer shall immediately proceed with the following obligations, regardless of any delay in determining or adjusting any amounts due 
 
 (1) Stop work and direct its subcontractors vendors suppliers partners to stop work as specified in the notice. 
 (2) Place no further orders for materials, services, or facilities, except as necessary to complete the continued portion of the OTA. 
 
 (3) Terminate all orders to the extent they relate to the work terminated. 
 (4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the AO, all right, title, and interest of the Performer under the orders terminated, in which case the Government shall have the right to settle or to pay any termination settlement proposal arising out of those terminations. 
 (5) With approval or ratification to the extent required by the AO, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination settlement proposals arising from the termination of orders the approval or ratification will be final. 
 
 (6) As directed by the AO, deliver to the Government with the license and usage rights contemplated hereunder for such work product or corresponding Deliverable

 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 

(ii) The completed or partially completed plans, drawings, information, and other property that, if the order had been completed, would have been required to be furnished to the Government. 
 
 (7) Complete performance of any work not terminated, if applicable. 
 
 In the event of a termination of this Agreement, the Government shall have patent rights (if any) as described herein. Failure of the Parties to agree to an equitable adjustment shall be resolved pursuant to the Disputes Article, Article VI. 
 Nothing in this section shall be construed as a limitation of the rights of either Party in the event of a breach of contract or default by the other party. 
 
 C. Stop Work 
 As directed by the AO, the Performer shall stop all, or any part, of the work called for under this Agreement for a period of 90 days after the written order is delivered, and for any further period to which the parties may agree. The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this Article. Upon receipt of the order, the Performer shall immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work stoppage. Within a period of 90 days after a stop-work is delivered, or within any extension of that period to which the Parties shall have agreed, the AO shall either 
 (a) Cancel the stop-work order or 
 (b) Terminate the work covered under this Agreement. 
 
 If a stop-work order issued is canceled, the Contractor shall resume work. The Government shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or negotiated price, or both, and the Government s share of this Agreement shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if 
 
 (1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this Agreement and 
 (2) The Contractor asserts its right to the adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage provided, that, if the Government decides the facts justify the action, the Government may receive and act upon a proposal submitted at any time before final payment under this Agreement. 
 
 D. Extension of Terms 
 The Parties may extend, by mutual written agreement, the term of this Agreement if funding availability and research opportunities reasonably warrant. Any extension shall be formalized through modification of the Agreement by the Agreements Officer and the Performer s Signatory Authority. 
 
 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 

E. Option for Increased Quantity 
 The Government may require the delivery of the numbered line item, identified in Article V Obligation and Payment, in the quantity and at the price stated. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor by the Option exercise date identified in Article V. Delivery of added items shall continue at the same rate that like items are called for under the agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree. 
 
 F. Bi-Lateral Approval for Option ALINs 
 These Article II terms only apply to the following R&D option ALINs . 
 The Government will notify the performer no later than six (6) months in advance of the Option Exercise Date stated in Article V, of the Government s intent to exercise Option ALINs with exception to ALINs . 
 The exceptions only require a three (3) month advance notice. This notification of intent does not commit the Government to exercise the identified Option ALINs, nor does it provide direction to start work or incur costs. This notification is to allow the performer adequate time for planning purposes. 
 If the Government provides the notification outlined in this Article, the performer is provided the opportunity to approve or disapprove the exercise of the stated Option ALINs. 
 Performer approval or disapproval must be provided to the Agreement s Officer (AO) by written notification within five (5) business days of the Government s notification. If a written notification is not received by the AO within the stated number of days, it will be deemed as Performer approval and the Government will have the unilateral right to proceed with the option exercise. 
 
 Performer disapproval shall include thorough justification, discussing the negative impact to the performer that would be caused from the exercising of the Option ALINs, as well as what consideration the Performer will provide since the Government is relinquishing its unilateral right to exercise the Option(s). The performer must also provide a Solution Brief to identify ways of meeting the Government s needs that the disapproved Option ALINs would have provided. 
 
 Justification for Performer disapproval cannot be based solely on the pre-negotiated price of the Option ALINs, and the Performer agrees not to attempt to renegotiate any Option ALINs based on price. 
 
 If the Government and Performer are unable to collectively identify an approach to meet the Government s needs from the disapproved Option ALINs, the Agreement may be modified to reflect the change and incorporate the agreed-to consideration. 
 
 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10

Meaning, a Flight Readiness Report or Flight Test Data and Reliability Report options for an individual aircraft may not be executed unless the site activation for that aircraft has already been executed in a previous modification or executed in the same modification. 
 H. Section 848 Exception to Policy (ETP) 
 Aircraft used in government directed test flights that are subject to DoD Policy Guidance for Procedures for the Operation and Procurement of Unmanned Aircraft Systems to Implement Section 848 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 shall require the appropriate approved ETP before flight.

 UNCLASSIFIED Page 87 

(d) Prechallenge request for information. 
 
 (1) The Agreement Officer may request the Performer or subcontractor to furnish a written explanation for any restriction asserted by the Performer or subcontractor on the right of the United States or others to use technical data. If, upon review of the explanation delivered, the Agreement Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis of the restrictive marking, the Agreement Officer may further request the Performer or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available to, the Performer or subcontractor to justify the validity of any restrictive marking on technical data delivered or to be delivered under the Agreement or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with supporting documentation). The Performer or subcontractor shall deliver such written data as requested by the Agreement Officer within the time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed. 
 
 (2) If the Agreement Officer, after reviewing the written data furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this article, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the marking and that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Agreement Officer shall follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of this article. 
 
 (3) If the Performer or subcontractor fails to respond to the Agreement Officer's request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of this article, and the Agreement Officer determines that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Agreement Officer may challenge the validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this article. 
 
 (e) Challenge. 
 
 (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement concerning inspection and acceptance, if the Agreement Officer determines that a challenge to the restrictive marking is warranted, the Agreement Officer shall send a written challenge notice to the Performer or subcontractor asserting the restrictive markings. Such challenge shall 
 
 (i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction 
 
 (ii) Require a response within sixty (60) days justifying and providing sufficient evidence as to the current validity of the asserted restriction 
 
 (iii) State that a DoD Agreement Officer's final decision, issued pursuant to paragraph (g) of this article, sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking identical to the asserted restriction, within the three-year period preceding the challenge, shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction if the validated restriction was asserted by the same Performer or subcontractor (or any licensee of such Performer or subcontractor) to which such notice is being provided and 
 
 (iv) State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may result in issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this article. 
 
 UNCLASSIFIED Page 88 

(2) The Agreement Officer shall extend the time for response as appropriate if the Performer or subcontractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response. 
 
 (3) The Performer's or subcontractor's written response shall be considered a claim within the meaning of 41 U.S.C. 7101 and shall be processed in accordance with ARTICLE VI DISPUTES of this agreement. In addition to the written claim, the performer or subcontractor shall certify to and include the following, regardless of dollar amount. 
 
 The certification shall state as follows 
 
 I certify that the claim is made in good faith that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the Government is liable and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the contractor. 
 
 (4) A Performer or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same restrictive markings from more than one Agreement Officer shall notify each Agreement Officer of the existence of more than one challenge. The notice shall also state which Agreement Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Agreement Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the Performer or subcontractor and the other Agreement Officers, shall formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested parties. The schedule shall afford the Performer or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this schedule. 
 
 (f) Final decision when Performer or subcontractor fails to respond. Upon a failure of a Performer or subcontractor to submit any response to the challenge notice the Agreement Officer will issue a final decision to the Performer or subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (b) of this article and the Disputes article of this Agreement pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction. This final decision shall be issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(2) of this article. Following issuance of the final decision, the Agreement Officer will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this article. 
 
 (g) Final decision when Performer or subcontractor responds. 
 
 (1) If the Agreement Officer determines that the Performer or subcontractor has justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Agreement Officer shall issue a final decision to the Performer or subcontractor sustaining the validity of the restrictive marking, and stating that the Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking. This final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Performer's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Agreement Officer has notified the Performer or subcontractor that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice. 
 
 (2)(i) If the Agreement Officer determines that the validity of the restrictive marking is not justified, the Agreement Officer shall issue a final decision to the Performer or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes article of this Agreement. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the Disputes article, the final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Performer's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that 
 UNCLASSIFIED Page 89 

the Agreement Officer has notified the Performer or subcontractor of the longer period that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice. 
 
 (ii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking for a period of ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Agreement Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this article. The Performer or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends to file suit in a court of competent jurisdiction, it will provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Agreement Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Agreement Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this article. If the Performer or subcontractor fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Agreement Officer within the ninety (90)-day period, the Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the failure of the Performer or subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such Government action. 
 
 (iii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking where a notice of intent to file suit in a court of competent jurisdiction is provided to the Agreement Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this article. The Government will no longer be bound, and the Performer or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or ignore the restrictive markings, if the Performer or subcontractor fails to file its suit within one (1) year after issuance of the final decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Chief of Contracting (or designee) of the represented Government Organization determines, that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Performer or subcontractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to the Performer or subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Performer's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law. 
 
 (iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the applicable statutes until final disposition by the Chief of Contracting (or designee) of the represented Government Organization or a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Chief of Contracting (or designee) of the represented Government Organization determines, following notice to the Performer that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by Chief of Contracting (or designee) of the represented Government Organization or a court of competent jurisdiction, the Performer or subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Performer's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law. 
 
 (h) Final disposition of appeal or suit. 
 
 (1) If the Performer or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Agreement Officer's decision is sustained 
 
 (i) The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be cancelled, corrected or ignored and 
 
 UNCLASSIFIED Page 90 

(ii) If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially justified, the Performer or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust. 
 
 (2) If the Performer or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Agreement Officer's decision is not sustained 
 
 (i) The Government shall continue to be bound by the restrictive marking and 
 
 (ii) The Government shall be liable to the Performer or subcontractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Performer or subcontractor in defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith. 
 
 (iii) Duration of right to challenge. The Government may review the validity of any restriction on technical data, delivered or to be delivered under a contract, asserted by the Performer or subcontractor. During the period within three (3) years of final payment on a contract or within three (3) years of delivery of the technical data to the Government, whichever is later, the Agreement Officer may review and make a written determination to challenge the restriction. The Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, disclosure or use of technical data at any time if such technical data 
 
 (1) Is publicly available 
 
 (2) Has been furnished to the United States without restriction or 
 
 (3) Has been otherwise made available without restriction. Only the Agreement Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking constitutes validation as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321. 
 
 (j) Decision not to challenge . A decision by the Government, or a determination by the Agreement Officer, to not challenge the restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute validation. 
 
 (k) Privity of contract. The Performer or subcontractor agrees that the Agreement Officer may transact matters under this article directly with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictive markings. However, this article neither creates nor implies privity of contract between the Government and subcontractors. 
 
 (l) Flowdown. The Performer or subcontractor agrees to insert this article in contractual instruments, including subcontracts and other contractual instruments for commercial items, with its subcontractors or suppliers at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data.

ATTACHMENT 1 STATEMENT OF WORK 
 Revised 20 March 2024 
 I. Background 
 
 Joby Aero Inc. (Joby) is developing an all-electric, piloted airplane which is capable of both conventional and vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) using simplified piloting techniques. This includes the development of core technologies, the integration of these technologies into a reliable aircraft and the implementation of these new flight capabilities including flight training and operational readiness. Joby is developing and maturing a range of core technologies which are required to enable all-electric conventional and vertical flight using simplified piloting techniques. These include an electric flight powertrain (flight capable batteries, motors, high-power electronics), high reliability electronic controllers, flight critical software, quiet and safe propeller technology and a range of new aerodynamic solutions enabled by electrification. Rapidly maturing these capabilities to demonstrate increased reliability and performance is key to the next era of electrified flight. 
 The Joby S4 is designed for civilian passenger operations and has a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of . It is a multi-motor, tilt-rotor aircraft driven by custom electric motors, inverters, and energy storage systems. The expected maximum speed of the production aircraft is 200 mph with a range of 150 miles on a single charge. This initial go-to market Minimal Viable Product (MVP) will be piloted utilizing Simplified Vehicle Operating (SVO) principles. These baseline capabilities are achievable with the current Gen 2 prototype, in manned and remote piloted configurations. As the S4 s system capabilities develop, Joby will document progress and conduct disciplined testing as appropriate, in coordination with Air Force personnel. 
 The integration of a whole range of new technologies into an airframe to prove out performance and reliability capabilities is critical to assuring leadership in the new era of electric aviation. Joby has matured eVTOL technologies from unmanned, 1.0, to optionally manned 2.0. Through development and maturation of these 2.0 vehicles Joby will refine core technologies and integrate them into a 2.1 vehicle which can satisfy requirements for civil aircraft certification and commercial introduction. At the same time, Joby will work with DoD airworthiness teams to impart new technological lessons learned so the state of DoD airworthiness can be evolved along with the capabilities of the vehicle. The design of the Joby 2.1 vehicle is intended to fit well into the existing airspace while introducing a range of new capabilities which do not exist today. . 
 . 
 
 UNCLASSIFIED Page 114 

. 
 Through the current SBIR period of performance with the additional options executed, Joby anticipates evolution of the capabilities of eVTOL from early optionally piloted prototypes to mature manned capable prototypes with ever increasing reliability and readiness. Moving from the early days of these technologies to a later stage will identify new benefits to be employed and opportunities for further development all while assuring technological leadership. 
 II. Objectives 
 
 In accordance with the long-term goals of SBIR Phase II agreement FA8002-20-9- 0143 and Agility Prime Program objectives the USAF intends to further the Joby SBIR program into a Phase three to include additional objectives to the continued maturation of the S4 as a manned, operationally useful aircraft for military use. These additional objectives include -
