 United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund, LP Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) For the period ended September 30, 2024 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent of the average daily percentage change in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts over the same period. UNL s investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a cost effective way to invest indirectly in natural gas and to hedge against movements in the spot price of natural gas. As a result, investors should be aware that UNL would meet its investment objective even if there are significant deviations between changes in its daily NAV and changes in the daily prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts, provided that the average daily percentage change in UNL s NAV over successive valuation days is within plus/minus ten percent of the average daily percentage change in the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts over the same period. UNL seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in futures contracts for natural gas that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Europe and ICE Futures U.S. (together, ICE Futures ), or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements, risk mitigation measures (including those that may be taken by UNL, UNL s futures commission merchants FCMs ), counterparties or other market participants), liquidity requirements, or in view of market conditions, other natural gas-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for natural gas, cleared swap contracts, and non-exchange traded over-the-counter or OTC transactions that are based on the price of natural gas, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, as well as futures contracts for crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Natural Gas-Related Investments ). Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UNL to invest in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments include, but are not limited to, those allowing UNL to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Natural Gas Interests in the notes to the financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, UNL held Futures Contracts for natural gas traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on ICE Futures US. USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in UNL s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track average daily changes in UNL s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF further believes that the daily changes in average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts have historically closely tracked the daily changes in the spot price of natural gas. USCF believes that the net effect of these two expected relationships will be that the daily changes in the price of UNL s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will continue to closely track the daily changes in the spot price of natural gas on a percentage basis, less UNL s expenses.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and the notes thereto of the United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund, LP UNL included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q: Forward-Looking Information This quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause UNL actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. UNL believes these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in inflation in the United States, movements in U.S. and foreign currencies, market volatility in the natural gas markets and futures markets, in part attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020, the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe UNL s future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, should, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend or project, the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and UNL cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. UNL s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. UNL has based the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q on information available to it on the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and UNL assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although UNL undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that UNL may make directly to them or through reports that UNL files in the future with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Introduction UNL, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The investment objective of UNL is for the average daily percentage changes in the NAV per share to reflect the average daily percentage changes of the spot price of natural gas delivered at the Henry Hub, Louisiana, as measured by the daily changes in the average of the prices of 12 futures contracts for natural gas traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the NYMEX ), consisting of the near month contract to expire and the contracts for the following 11 months, for a total of 12 consecutive months contracts, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire and the contracts for the following 11 consecutive months (the Benchmark Futures Contracts ), plus interest earned on UNL s collateral holdings less UNL s expenses. Near month contract means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire. Next month contract means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract. When calculating the daily movement of the average price of the 12 contracts, each contract month is equally weighted. UNL seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in UNL s NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts over the same period. UNL s investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a cost effective way to invest indirectly in natural gas and to hedge against movements in the spot price of natural gas. As a result, investors should be aware that UNL would meet its investment objective even if there are significant deviations between changes in its daily NAV and changes in the daily prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts, provided that the average daily percentage change in UNL s NAV over 30 successive valuation days is within plus/minus ten percent (10 of the average daily percentage change in the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts over the same period. UNL s investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of natural gas or any particular futures contract based on natural gas nor is UNL s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day . The general partner of UNL, United States Commodity Funds LLC USCF ), believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Natural Gas Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments (as defined below).

 UNL invests primarily in natural gas futures contracts that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Exchange ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, Natural Gas Futures Contracts and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements, risk mitigation measures (including those that may be taken by UNL, UNL s FCMs, counterparties or other market participants), liquidity requirements, or in view of market conditions, other natural gas-related investments such as cash-settled options on Natural Gas Futures Contracts, forward contracts for natural gas, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded over-the-counter OTC swaps that are based on the price of natural gas, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Natural Gas-Related Investments ). Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause UNL to invest in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments include those allowing UNL to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Natural Gas Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments collectively are referred to as Natural Gas Interests in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in UNL s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis to closely track daily changes in UNL s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF further believes that daily changes in the average prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts have historically closely tracked the daily changes in spot price of natural gas. USCF believes that the net effect of these relationships will be that the daily changes in the price of UNL s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track the daily changes in the spot price of a MMBtu of natural gas on a percentage basis, plus interest earned on UNL s collateral holdings, less UNL s expenses. Regulatory Disclosure The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law. Below are certain key regulatory requirements that are, or may be, relevant to UNL. The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), CFTC, NFA, the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some examples of how new rules and regulations could impact UNL are discussed in Item 1. Business in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Exchange Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits Designated contract markets DCMs ), such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by UNL is not) may hold, own or control. These levels and position limits apply to the futures contracts that UNL invests in to meet its investment objective. In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures may also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts. The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price. Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit. The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contracts and other Natural Gas Futures Contracts traded on U.S.-based futures exchanges such as the NYMEX are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions. The current accountability level for investments for any one-month in the Benchmark Futures Contracts is 6,000 net contracts. In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability levels for all months of 12,000 net futures contracts for investments in futures contracts for natural gas. In addition, the ICE Futures maintains accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its futures contracts for natural gas contracts. If UNL and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contract for natural gas, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor UNL s and the Related Public Funds exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of UNL and the Related Public Funds. If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, UNL and the Related Public Funds could be ordered to reduce their aggregate net futures contracts back to the accountability level. The foregoing accountability levels and position limits are subject to change. As of September 30, 2024, UNL held 617 Natural Gas Futures NG contracts traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any ICE Natural Gas Futures contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, UNL did not exceed accountability levels imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures, however, the aggregated total of certain of the Related Public Funds did exceed the accountability levels. No action was taken by NYMEX and UNL did not reduce the number of Natural Gas Futures Contracts held as a result.

 Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire. It is unlikely that UNL will run up against such position limits because of UNL s investment strategy. UNL s investment strategy is to invest in 12 consecutive months of futures contracts on natural gas as traded on the NYMEX, comprised of the near month contract to expire and the contracts for the following 11 months. UNL rolls the near-month futures contracts in its portfolio when the near month futures contract is within two weeks of expiration. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, UNL did not exceed any position limits imposed by the NYMEX and the ICE Futures. Federal Position Limits Part 150 of the CFTC s regulations (the Position Limits Rule establishes federal position limits for 25 core referenced futures contracts (comprised of agricultural, energy and metals futures contracts), futures and options linked to the core referenced futures contracts, and swaps that are economically equivalent to the core referenced futures contracts that all market participants must comply with, with certain exemptions. Certain of the Benchmark Futures Contracts are subject to position limits under the Position Limits Rule, and UNL s trading does not qualify for an exemption therefrom. Accordingly, the Position Limits Rule could inhibit UNL s ability to invest in the relevant Benchmark Futures Contracts and thereby could negatively impact the ability of UNL to meet its investment objective. UNL has not limited the size of its offering and intends to utilize substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Benchmark Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments to the extent possible. If UNL encounters accountability levels, position limits (including those set by the Position Limits Rule), or price fluctuation limits for the Benchmark Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase the Benchmark Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed natural gas futures or enter into swaps or other permitted investments to meet its investment objective. In addition, if UNL exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures, and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of UNL s shares and the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. Margin for OTC Swaps Rules put in place by U.S. federal banking regulators, the CFTC and the SEC require the daily exchange of variation margin and initial margin for swaps between swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants Swap Entities and swaps between Swap Entities and their counterparties that are financial end-users (such rules, the Margin Rules ). The Margin Rules require Swap Entities to exchange variation margin with all of their counterparties who are financial end-users. The minimum variation margin amount is the daily mark-to-market change in the value of the swap, taking into account the amount of variation margin previously posted or collected. Swap Entities are required to exchange initial margin with their financial end-users who have material swaps exposure (i.e., an average daily aggregate notional of 8 billion or more in non-cleared swaps calculated in accordance with the Margin Rules). The Margin Rules specify the types of collateral that may be posted or collected as initial margin or variation margin (generally cash, certain government, government-sponsored enterprise securities, certain liquid debt, certain equity securities, certain eligible publicly traded debt, and gold) and sets forth haircuts for certain collateral asset classes. UNL is not a Swap Entity under the Margin Rules, but it is a financial end-user. Accordingly, UNL will be subject to the variation margin requirements of the Margin Rules for any swaps that it enters into. However, UNL does not have material swaps exposure under the Margin Rules and, accordingly, UNL will not be subject to the initial margin requirements of the Margin Rules.

 Mandatory Trading and Clearing of Swaps CFTC regulations require that certain swap transactions be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations derivative clearing organizations DCOs )), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular class of swap and such swap is made available to trade on a swap execution facility. Currently, swap dealers, major swap participants, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in activities that are financial in nature are required to execute on a swap execution facility, and clear, certain interest rate swaps and index-based credit default swaps. As a result, if UNL enters into an interest rate or index-based credit default swap that is subject to these requirements, such swap will be required to be executed on a swap execution facility and centrally cleared. Mandatory clearing and made available to trade determinations with respect to additional types of swaps may be issued in the future, and, when finalized, could require UNL to electronically execute and centrally clear certain OTC instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis. If a swap is required to be cleared, initial and variation margin requirements are set by the relevant clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines. Additional margin may be required and held by UNL s FCMs. Other Requirements for Swaps In addition to the margin requirements described above, swaps that are not required to be cleared and executed on a SEF but that are executed bilaterally are also subject to various requirements pursuant to CFTC regulations, including, among other things, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and, depending on the status of the counterparties, trading documentation requirements and dispute resolution requirements. Derivatives Regulations in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions In addition to U.S. laws and regulations, UNL may be subject to non-U.S. derivatives laws and regulations if it engages in futures and/or swap transactions with non-U.S. persons. For example, UNL may be impacted by European laws and regulations to the extent that it engages in futures transactions on European exchanges or derivatives transactions with European entities. Other jurisdictions impose requirements applicable to futures and derivatives that are similar to those imposed by the U.S., including position limits, margin, clearing and trade execution requirements. The CFTC is generally prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets. The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States. These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States. Infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 could negatively affect UNL and the valuation and performance of UNL s investments. Infectious disease outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic may arise in the future and could adversely affect UNL and, more generally, individual issuers and capital markets, in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. For example, COVID-19 resulted in numerous deaths, travel restrictions, closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines and the imposition of both local and more widespread work from home measures, cancellations, loss of employment, supply chain disruptions, and lower consumer and institutional demand for goods and services, as well as general concern and uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic that occurred in 2020 had a material adverse impact on local economies in the affected jurisdictions and also on the global economy, as cross border commercial activity and market sentiment were impacted by the outbreak and government and other measures seeking to contain COVID-19 s spread. An infectious disease outbreak may arise in the future and could have the same or similar effects as the COVID-19 pandemic, or different effects that cannot be foreseen. Moreover, as was the case with the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by government and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world in response to an infectious disease outbreak, including the potential for significant fiscal and monetary policy changes, may affect the value, volatility, pricing and liquidity of some investments or other assets, including those held by or invested in by UNL. Public health crises caused by infectious disease outbreaks may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally and their duration cannot be determined with certainty.

 In a rising rate environment, UNL may not be able to fully invest at prevailing rates until any current investments in Treasury Bills mature in order to avoid selling those investments at a loss. When interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities typically falls. In a rising interest rate environment, UNL may not be able to fully invest at prevailing rates until any current investments in Treasury Bills mature in order to avoid selling those investments at a loss. Interest rate risk is generally lower for shorter term investments and higher for longer term investments. The risk to UNL of rising interest rates may be greater in the future due to the end of a long period of historically low rates, the effect of potential monetary policy initiatives, including actions taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other foreign equivalents to curb inflation, and resulting market reaction to those initiatives. When interest rates fall, UNL may be required to reinvest the proceeds from the sale, redemption or early prepayment of a Treasury Bill or money market security at a lower interest rate. UNL may potentially lose money by investing in government money market funds. UNL invests in government money market funds. Although such government money market funds seek to preserve the value of an investment at 1.00 per share, there is no guarantee that they will be able to do so and UNL may lose money by investing in a government money market fund. An investment in a government money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ), or any other government agency. The share price of a government money market fund can fall below the 1.00 share price. UNL cannot rely on or expect a government money market fund s adviser or its affiliates to enter into support agreements or take other actions to maintain the government money market fund s 1.00 share price. The credit quality of a government money market fund s holdings can change rapidly in certain markets, and the default of a single holding could have an adverse impact on the government money market fund s share price. Due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of securities held by a government money market fund may vary. A government money market fund s share price can also be negatively affected during periods of high redemption pressures and/or illiquid markets. Price Movements Natural gas futures prices were volatile during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts started the period at 2.769 per million British thermal shares MMBtu ). The high of the period was on June 11, 2024 when the price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts reached 3.503 per MMBtu. The low of the period was on February 20, 2024 when the price dropped to 2.509 per MMBtu. The period ended with the Benchmark Futures Contracts at 3.272 per MMBtu, an increase of approximately 18.17 over the period. UNL s per share NAV began the period at 8.58 and ended the period at 7.92 on September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately (7.69) over the period. The Benchmark Futures Contracts prices listed above began with the February 2024 to January 2025 contracts and ended with the November 2024 to January 2025 contracts. An increase of approximately 18.17 on the Benchmark Futures Contracts listed above is a hypothetical return only and would not actually be realized by an investor holding Futures Contracts. An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result. Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the period to the end of the period, does not represent the actual benchmark results that UNL seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled Tracking UNL s Benchmark . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the natural gas futures market was primarily in a state of contango with the exception of January, which was primarily in backwardation. When the market is in a state of contango, the near month natural gas futures contract is lower than the price of the next month natural gas futures contract, or contracts further away from expiration. During periods of backwardation the near month natural gas futures contract is higher than the price of the next month natural gas futures contract, or contracts further away from expiration. For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see Term Structure of Natural Gas Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns below. Valuation of Futures Contracts and the Computation of the Per Share NAV The per share NAV of UNL s shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other UNL investments, including cleared swaps, or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.

 Results of Operations and the Natural Gas Market Results of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, UNL had 2,550,000 shares outstanding. On April 26, 2022, the SEC declared effective the registration statement filed by UNL that registered an unlimited number of shares. As a result, UNL has an unlimited number of shares that can be issued in the form of Creation Baskets. More shares may have been issued by UNL than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares. As of September 30, 2024, UNL had the following Authorized Participants: Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Jane Street Capital LLC, JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Company Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC and Virtu Americas LLC.

UNL s expenses consist of investment management fees, brokerage fees and commissions, certain offering costs, licensing fees, registration fees, the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements. The management fee that UNL pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of UNL. The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by UNL, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a result, the amount of income earned by UNL as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower. The increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to an increase in reporting costs and professional fees. The increase in total commissions accrued to brokers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to a higher number of Natural Gas Futures Contracts being held and traded.

The management fee that UNL pays to USCF is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of UNL. The fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. Average interest rates earned on short-term investments held by UNL, including cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries, were higher during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a result, the amount of income earned by UNL as a percentage of average daily total net assets was higher during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. To the degree that the aggregate yield is higher, the net expense ratio, inclusive of income, will be lower. The increase in total fees and other expenses excluding management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to a increase in reporting costs and professional fees. The increase in total commissions accrued to brokers for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to a higher number of Natural Gas Futures Contracts being held and traded. Tracking UNL s Benchmark USCF seeks to manage UNL s portfolio such that changes in its average daily per share NAV, on a percentage basis, closely track the daily changes in the average price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts, also on a percentage basis. Specifically, USCF seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of 30-valuation days, the average daily change in UNL s per share NAV is within a range of 90 to 110 (0.9 to 1.1) of the average daily change in the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. As an example, if the average daily movement of the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts for a particular 30-valuation day time period was 0.50 per day, USCF would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per share NAV during that same time period fell between 0.45 and 0.55 (i.e., between 0.9 and 1.1 of the benchmark s results). UNL s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of UNL s per share NAV equal to the average of the nominal prices of the current Benchmark Futures Contracts or the spot price for natural gas. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments. For the 30-valuation days ended September 30, 2024, the average daily change in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts was 0.209 , while the average daily change in the per share NAV of UNL over the same time period was 0.220 . The average daily difference was 0.011 (or 1.1 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1 ), meaning that over this time period UNL s NAV performed was within the plus or minus 10 range established as its benchmark tracking goal.

 Since the commencement of the offering of UNL s shares to the public on November 18, 2009 to September 30, 2024, the average daily change in the average price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts was (0.030) , while the average daily change in the per share NAV of UNL over the same time period was (0.029) . The average daily difference was 0.001 (or 0.1 basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100 of 1 ), meaning that over this time period UNL s NAV performed within the plus or minus 10 range established as its benchmark tracking goal. The following two charts demonstrate the correlation between the changes in UNL s NAV and the changes in the Benchmark Futures Contracts. The first below shows the daily movement of UNL s per share NAV versus the daily movement of the Benchmark Futures Contracts for the 30 valuation day period ended September 30, 2024, the last trading day in September. The second chart below shows the monthly total returns of UNL as compared to the monthly value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts for the five years ended September 30, 2024. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS

Table of Contents 
 PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS An alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of UNL versus the return of its Benchmark Futures Contracts can be calculated by comparing the actual return of UNL, measured by changes in its per share NAV, versus the expected changes in its per share NAV under the assumption that UNL s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in the average of the prices of its Benchmark Futures Contracts for the period ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the actual total return of UNL as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (7.69) . This is based on an initial per share NAV of 8.58 as of December 31, 2023 and an ending per share NAV as of September 30, 2024 of 7.92. During this time period, UNL made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if UNL s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contracts, UNL would have had an estimated per share NAV of 7.70 as of September 30, 2024, for a total return over the relevant time period of (10.26) . The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UNL of (7.69) and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contracts of (10.26) was a difference over the time period of 2.56 , which is to say that UNL s actual total return outperformed its benchmark by that percentage. UNL incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UNL to track slightly lower or higher than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. By comparison, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the actual total return of UNL as measured by changes in its per share NAV was (36.95) . This is based on an initial per share NAV of 17.24 as of December 31, 2022 and an ending per share NAV as of September 30, 2023 of 10.87. During this time period, UNL made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if UNL s daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark Futures Contracts, UNL would have had an estimated per share NAV of 10.55 as of September 30, 2023, for a total return over the relevant time period of (38.81) . The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of UNL of (36.95) and the expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contracts of (38.81) was a difference over the time period of 1.86 , which is to say that UNL s actual total return outperformed its benchmark by that percentage. UNL incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses, offset by interest and dividend income, and net of positive or negative execution, tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UNL to track slightly lower or higher than daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts.

 There are three factors that typically have impacted or are most likely to impact UNL s ability to accurately track its Benchmark Futures Contracts in addition to the foregoing. First, UNL may buy or sell its holdings in the then current Benchmark Futures Contracts at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which UNL executes the trade. In that case, UNL may pay a price that is higher, or lower, than the closing settlement price of the Benchmark Futures Contracts, which could cause the changes in the daily per share NAV of UNL to either be higher or lower to the daily changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, USCF attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the Benchmark Futures Contracts at, or as close as possible to, the end of the day settlement price. However, it may not always be possible for UNL to obtain the settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact UNL s attempt to track the Benchmark Futures Contracts. Second, UNL incurs expenses primarily composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses. The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UNL to track slightly lower than daily changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. At the same time, UNL earns dividend and interest income on its cash, cash equivalents and Treasuries. UNL is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its shareholders and did not make any distributions to shareholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest payments, and any other income, were retained within the portfolio and added to UNL s NAV. When this income exceeds the level of UNL s expenses for its management fee, brokerage commissions and other expenses (including ongoing registration fees, licensing fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF), UNL will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of UNL to track slightly higher than daily changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. If short-term interest rates rise above these current levels, the level of deviation created by the yield would increase. Conversely, if short-term interest rates were to decline, the amount of error created by the yield would decrease. When short-term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions, then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per share NAV to underperform the daily returns of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. USCF anticipates that interest rates may continue to stagnate over the near future. It is anticipated that fees and expenses paid by UNL may be lower than interest earned by UNL. As such, USCF anticipates that UNL could possibly outperform its benchmark so long as interest earned is greater than the fees and expenses paid by UNL. Third, UNL may hold Other Natural Gas-Related Investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the Benchmark Futures Contracts total return movements. In that case, the error in tracking the Benchmark Futures Contracts could result in daily changes in the per share NAV of UNL that are either too high, or too low, relative to the daily changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, UNL did not hold any Other Natural Gas-Related Investments. If UNL increases in size, and due to its obligations to comply with market conditions, regulatory limits, and risk mitigation measures imposed by its FCMs, UNL may invest in Other Natural Gas-Related Investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error. Term Structure of Natural Gas Futures Prices and the Impact on Total Returns. Several factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts. One factor arises from rolling futures contracts that will expire at the end of the current month (the near or front month contract) forward each month prior to expiration. For a strategy that entails holding the near month contract, the price relationship between that futures contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns. For example, if the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the next futures month contract (a situation referred to as backwardation ), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration. Conversely, if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract (a situation referred to as contango ), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration. As an example, assume that the price of natural gas for immediate delivery, is 3 per MMBtu, and the value of a position in the near month futures contract is also 3. Over time, the price of natural gas will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including demand for natural gas relative to supply. The value of the near month futures contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors. If an investor seeks to maintain a position in a near month futures contract and not take delivery of physical MMBtu of natural gas, the investor must sell the current near month futures contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month futures contract. In order to continue holding a position in the current near month futures contract, this roll forward of the futures contract must be executed every month.

 Contango and backwardation are natural market forces that have impacted the total return on an investment in UNL s shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in natural gas. In the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of UNL s shares and changes in the spot prices of natural gas will continue to be impacted by contango and backwardation. It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing natural gas, which could be substantial. If the futures market is in backwardation, e.g., when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the next month futures contract, the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures contract. Assuming the price of the next month futures contract was 2.94 per MMBtu, or 2 cheaper than the 3 near month futures contract, then, hypothetically, and assuming no other changes (e.g., to either prevailing natural gas prices or the price relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract, and, ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the 2.94 next month futures contract would rise to 3 as it approaches expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price of natural gas. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise 12 while the spot price of natural gas may have risen a lower amount, e.g., only 10 . Similarly, the spot price of natural gas could have fallen 10 while the value of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., only 8 . Over time, if backwardation remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase. If the futures market is in contango, an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near month futures contract. Again, assuming the near month futures contract is 3 per MMBtu, the price of the next month futures contract might be 3.06 per MMBtu, or 2 more expensive than the front month futures contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes, the value of the 3.06 next month futures contract would fall to 3 as it approaches expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of natural gas. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only 10 while the spot price of natural gas may have risen a higher amount, e.g., 12 . Similarly, the spot price of natural gas could have fallen 10 while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., 12 . Over time, if contango remained constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase. The chart below compares the daily price of the near month natural gas futures contract to the price of the 13 th month natural gas futures contract (i.e., a contract one year forward) over the last 10 years. When the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the 13 th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation. When the price of the near month futures contract is lower than the 13 th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in contango. Although the price of the near month futures contract and the price of the 13 th month futures contract tend to move together, it can be seen that at times the near month futures contract prices are higher than the 13 th month futures contract prices (backwardation) and, at other times, the near month futures contract prices are lower than the 13 th month futures contract prices (contango).

 PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS An alternative way to view the same data is to subtract the dollar price of the 13 th month natural gas futures contract from the dollar price of the near month natural gas futures contract, as shown in the chart below. When the difference is positive, the market is in backwardation. When the difference is negative, the market is in contango. The natural gas market spent time in both backwardation and contango during the last ten years. The chart below shows the results from subtracting the average dollar price of the near 12-month contracts from the near month price for the 10-year period between September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2024. Investors will note that the natural gas market spent time in both backwardation and contango.

 PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS An investment in a portfolio that owned only the near month natural gas futures contract would likely produce a different result than an investment in a portfolio that owned an equal number of each of the near 12 months of natural gas futures contracts. Generally speaking, when the natural gas futures market is in backwardation, a portfolio of only the near month natural gas futures contract may tend to have a higher total return than a portfolio of 12 months of the natural gas futures contract. Conversely, if the natural gas futures market was in contango, the portfolio containing only 12 months of natural gas futures contracts may tend to outperform the portfolio holding only the near month natural gas futures contract.

 Historically, the natural gas futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation. Because natural gas demand is seasonal, it is possible for the price of natural gas futures contracts for delivery within one or two months to rapidly move from backwardation into contango and back again within the relatively short period of time of less than one year. Periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact UNL s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. This is because the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both UNL s shares and the Benchmark Futures Contracts. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future. It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods and, because of the seasonal nature of natural gas demand, both may occur within a single year s time. Natural Gas Market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average price of the Benchmark Natural Gas Futures Contracts traded in a range between 2.503 and 3.509. The average price of the Benchmark Natural Gas Futures Contracts increased 18.17 from the end of 2023 through September 30, 2024, finishing the quarter at 3.272. The number of rigs dedicated to natural gas production fell from 120 at the start of the year to 99 by the end of the quarter. Natural Gas stored in the United States stood at 3,547 billion cubic feet as of September 30, 2024, about 3.7 higher than the same time last year. While both domestic demand and U.S. exports of natural gas have generally increased over the last five years, U.S. production has also continued to increase, leading to the storage surplus over one-year ago and five-year ago levels. Overall mild temperatures relative to expectations for the better part of the year, and the persistent surplus of gas in storage have weighed on prices. While the Biden administration s restrictions on natural gas exports have also kept prices low, the increasing demand for LNG may lift prices, as could potential new demand for natural gas to power AI data centers. The imminent U.S. presidential election may impact prices, though the president's influence is more limited than either candidate conveys. A Trump administration could ease some of the restrictions on natural gas exports, new projects, and the build out of new infrastructure, leading to higher flows overseas and potentially supporting prices over time. It is unclear if a Harris administration would continue Biden s policies affecting natural gas, be more or less restrictive, or vary based on the impact on various constituencies such as consumers and environmental groups. Ultimately, any administration s energy policy is constrained by various factors. Natural gas prices in the United States have historically been driven by domestic supply and demand. Natural gas also exhibits seasonal patterns whereby both production and end-user demand increase in autumn and winter months. The U.S. possesses abundant sources of natural gas. The robust ability of the U.S. energy industry to meet demand constrained natural gas prices over the previous decade and could lead to price constraints again in the future except during periods of extreme temperatures. In recent years, natural gas exports have increased, including liquid natural gas (LNG) exported to Europe. Rising international demand has had and will continue to have a growing impact on natural gas prices in the United States. This is especially true given that the United States is rapidly building, but does not currently possess, the infrastructure necessary to meet all international demand. While domestic supply and demand are likely to remain the dominant influence on prices in the long term, international demand and extraordinary international events will have a growing influence on price volatility and price direction. The Russia-Ukraine war caused dramatic changes in natural gas supply-demand dynamics in Europe. The Russian invasion led the European Union to declare it would reduce its dependance on Russian fossil fuels and phase imports out completely as soon as possible. Russia, in turn, slowed pipelines and cutoff supplies, ultimately reducing its natural gas supplied to Europe by more than 50 since the onset of the war. Uncertainty is sure to persist as the reconfiguration of natural gas supply chains and an accelerated push for alternative sources of energy, including energy from renewables, continues. These changes are likely to contribute to U.S. natural gas price volatility. Substantial price changes, such as those seen in 2022 and 2023, cannot be ruled out. It is also possible that markets have seen the most severe shocks from the Russian invasion and that further price swings could be less severe in magnitude. Of course, many factors impact natural gas prices, and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war must be balanced with other potential events, such as extreme weather, political unrest, attacks or threats of attack by terrorists, conflicts in the Middle East, or the potential for infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 and responses to such an outbreak.

 Natural Gas Price Movements in Comparison to Other Energy Commodities and Investment Categories. USCF believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class. Statistically, such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time. The correlation is scaled between 1 and -1, where 1 indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together, known as positive correlation, and -1 indicates that they move in completely opposite directions, known as negative correlation. A correlation of 0 would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated, known as non-correlation. That is, the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions. For the ten-year time period between September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2024, the table below compares the monthly movements of natural gas prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities, such as crude oil, diesel-heating oil, and unleaded gasoline, as well as several major non-commodity investment asset classes, such as large cap U.S. equities, U.S. government bonds and global equities.

 Investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between natural gas and various other energy commodities, as well as other investment asset classes, as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results. The results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected. USCF believes that natural gas has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time. However, USCF also believes that in the future it is possible that natural gas could have long-term correlation results that indicate prices of natural gas more closely track the movements of equities or bonds. In addition, USCF believes that, when measured over time periods shorter than ten years, there will always be some periods where the correlation of natural gas to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest. The correlations between natural gas, crude oil, diesel-heating oil and gasoline are relevant because USCF endeavors to invest UNL s assets in natural gas Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in UNL s per share NAV correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts. If certain other fuel-based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the natural gas Futures Contracts, then their use could lead to greater tracking error. As noted above, USCF also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the spot price of natural gas. Critical Accounting Policies Preparation of the condensed financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. UNL s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. USCF has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing UNL s condensed financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments, which are not traded on a United States or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as forward contracts and OTC swaps) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by UNL for its Futures Contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available, while OTC swaps are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis. In addition, UNL estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material. Liquidity and Capital Resources UNL has not made, and does not anticipate making, use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. UNL has met, and it is anticipated that UNL will continue to meet, its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments, or from the Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times. UNL s liquidity needs include: redeeming shares, providing margin deposits for its existing Futures Contracts or the purchase of additional Futures Contracts and posting collateral for its OTC swaps, if applicable, and payment of its expenses, summarized below under Contractual Obligations. UNL currently generates cash primarily from: (i) the sale of baskets consisting of 50,000 shares Creation Baskets and (ii) income earned on Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. UNL has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in Natural Gas Interests. UNL invests in Natural Gas Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments. A significant portion of UNL s NAV is held in cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in Natural Gas Interests. The balance of the assets is held in UNL s account at its custodian bank and in investments in money market funds and Treasuries at the FCMs. Income received from UNL s investments in money market funds and Treasuries is paid to UNL. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, UNL s expenses, pre and post expense waiver, did not exceed the income UNL earned and the cash earned from the sale of Creation Baskets and the redemption of Redemption Baskets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, UNL did not use other assets to pay expenses, post expense waiver. To the extent income exceeds expenses, UNL s NAV will be positively impacted.

Table of Contents 
 Although permitted to do so under its LP Agreement, UNL has not leveraged, and does not intend to leverage, its assets through borrowings or otherwise, and makes its investments accordingly. Consistent with the foregoing, UNL s investments will take into account the need for UNL to maintain adequate liquidity to meet its margin and collateral requirements and to avoid, to the extent reasonably possible, UNL becoming leveraged. If the market conditions require it, these risk reduction procedures, including changes to UNL s investments, may occur on short notice. UNL does not and will not borrow money or use debt to satisfy its margin or collateral obligations in respect of its investments, but it could become leveraged if UNL were to hold insufficient assets that would allow it to meet not only the current, but also future, margin or collateral obligations required for such investments. Such a circumstance could occur if UNL were to hold assets that have a value of less than zero. USCF endeavors to have the value of UNL s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by UNL or posted as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its natural gas Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments. UNL s investments in Natural Gas Interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits. During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit. Such market conditions could prevent UNL from promptly liquidating its positions in Futures Contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, UNL did not purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect; however, UNL cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future. Since the initial offering of shares, UNL has been responsible for expenses relating to: (i) management fees, (ii) brokerage fees and commissions, (iii) licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, (iv) ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its shares subsequent to the initial offering, (v) other expenses, including tax reporting costs, (vi) fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF and (vii) other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business. UNL may terminate at any time, regardless of whether UNL has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement. In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i) market conditions, regulatory requirements, risk mitigation measures (including those that may be taken by UNL, UNL s FCMs, counterparties or other market participants) that would lead UNL to determine that it could no longer foreseeably meet its investment objective or that UNL s aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses or its margin or collateral requirements make the continued operation of UNL unreasonable or imprudent, or (ii) adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal or removal of USCF as the general partner of UNL could cause UNL, to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions. However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate UNL. UNL s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment. Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio. Market Risk Trading in Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, such as forwards, involves UNL entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell natural gas at a specified date in the future. The aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed UNL s future cash requirements since UNL intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, UNL is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts. UNL considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with UNL s commitments to purchase natural gas is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held. However, should UNL enter into a contractual commitment to sell natural gas, it would be required to make delivery of the natural gas at the contract price, repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash. Since there are no limits on the future price of natural gas, the market risk to UNL could be unlimited. UNL s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors, including the markets for natural gas, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments markets and the relationships 

 36 

Table of Contents 
 among the contracts held by UNL. Drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital. Credit Risk When UNL enters into Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. The counterparty for the Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general, in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and, therefore, this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk. UNL is not currently a member of any clearinghouse. Some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to UNL in such circumstances. USCF attempts to manage the credit risk of UNL by following various trading limitations and policies. In particular, UNL generally posts margin and/or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the Futures Contracts and Other Natural Gas-Related Investments it holds. USCF has implemented procedures that include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and/or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of UNL to limit its credit exposure. An FCM, when acting on behalf of UNL in accepting orders to purchase or sell Futures Contracts on United States exchanges, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to UNL, all assets of UNL relating to domestic Futures Contracts trading. These FCMs are not allowed to commingle UNL s assets with their other assets. In addition, the CFTC requires FCMs to hold in a secure account UNL s assets related to foreign Futures Contracts. In the future UNL may purchase OTC swaps, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of OTC swaps. As of September 30, 2024, UNL held cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds in the amount of 20,313,679 with the custodian and FCMs. Some or all of these amounts held by a custodian or an FCM, as applicable, may be subject to loss should UNL s custodian or FCMs, as applicable, cease operations. Off Balance Sheet Financing As of September 30, 2024, UNL had no loan guarantee, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of UNL. While UNL s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on UNL s financial position. Redemption Basket Obligation In order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below, UNL requires liquidity to redeem shares, which redemptions must be in blocks of 50,000 shares called Redemption Baskets. UNL has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its Treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of shares being redeemed. Contractual Obligations UNL s primary contractual obligations are with USCF. In return for its services, USCF is entitled to a management fee calculated daily and paid monthly as a fixed percentage of UNL s NAV, calculated at 0.75 through April 30 and effective May 1, at 0.60 . USCF agreed to pay the start-up costs associated with the formation of UNL, primarily its legal, accounting and other costs in connection with USCF s registration with the CFTC as a CPO and the registration and listing of UNL and its shares with the SEC, FINRA and NYSE Arca (formerly, AMEX), respectively. However, since UNL s initial offering of shares, offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional shares of UNL have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by UNL, and not by USCF.

 USCF pays the fees of the Marketing Agent as well as BNY Mellon s fees for performing administrative, custodial, and transfer agency services. BNY Mellon s fees for performing administrative services include those in connection with the preparation of UNL s condensed financial statements and its SEC, NFA and CFTC reports. USCF and certain Related Public Funds have also entered into a licensing agreement with the NYMEX pursuant to which the Related Public Funds, other than BNO, USCI and CPER, pay a licensing fee to the NYMEX. UNL also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements. In addition to USCF s management fee, UNL pays its brokerage fees (including fees to FCMs), OTC dealer spreads, any licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, and, subsequent to the initial offering, registration and other fees paid to the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of shares, as well as legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated therewith, and extraordinary expenses. The latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of UNL s business, including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the LP Agreement, the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation. Commission payments to FCMs are on a contract-by-contract, or round turn, basis. UNL also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of USCF. See Note 3 to the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods, as UNL s per share NAVs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date. These agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew, or, in some cases, are in effect for the duration of UNL s existence. Either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements. As of September 30, 2024, UNL s portfolio consisted of 617 Natural Gas Futures NG contracts traded on the NYMEX. As of September 30, 2024, UNL did not hold any Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures. For a list of UNL s current holdings, please see UNL s website at www.uscfinvestments.com. The end of day portfolio disclosed on UNL s website would reflect any investments in Futures Contracts beyond the Benchmark Futures Contracts, and/or Other Natural Gas-Related Investments, including any made in light of market conditions, regulatory requirements, risk mitigation measures (including those that may be taken by UNL, UNL s FCMs, counterparties or other market participants), liquidity requirements, or other factors. Independent of the UNL website, UNL may make available portfolio holdings information to Authorized Participants that reflects the Fund s anticipated holdings. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Commodity Price Risk UNL is exposed to commodity price risk. In particular, UNL is exposed to natural gas price risk through its holdings of Futures Contracts together with any other derivatives in which it may invest, which are discussed below. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Futures Contracts that UNL holds in its portfolio, as described in Contractual Obligations under Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above, are expected to directly affect the value of UNL s shares. OTC Contract Risk UNL may purchase OTC contracts, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts. Unlike most exchange-traded futures contracts or exchange-traded options on such futures, each party to an OTC swap bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract. UNL may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract Exchange for Related Position or EFRP transactions). In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by UNL, the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of UNL shares. These EFRP transactions may expose UNL to counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution. Swap transactions, like other financial transactions, involve a variety of significant risks. The specific risks presented by a particular swap transaction necessarily depend upon the terms and circumstances of the transaction. In general, however, all swap transactions involve some combination of market risk, credit risk, counterparty credit risk, funding risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. 

 38 

Table of Contents 
 Highly customized swap transactions in particular may increase liquidity risk, which may result in a suspension of redemptions. Highly leveraged transactions may experience substantial gains or losses in value as a result of relatively small changes in the value or level of an underlying or related market factor. In evaluating the risks and contractual obligations associated with a particular swap transaction, it is important to consider that a swap transaction may be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the original parties and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms. Therefore, it may not be possible for USCF to modify, terminate or offset UNL s obligations or its exposure to the risks associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date. To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts, UNL will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty, if the counterparty is unable to meet its obligations to UNL due to the occurrence of a specified event, such as the insolvency of the counterparty. USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC swap pursuant to guidelines approved by the Board. Furthermore, USCF on behalf of UNL only enters into OTC swaps with counterparties who are, or are affiliates of, (a) banks regulated by a United States federal bank regulator, (b) broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, (c) insurance companies domiciled in the United States, or (d) producers, users or traders of energy, whether or not regulated by the CFTC. Any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the United States or the United Kingdom unless otherwise approved by the Board after consultation with its legal counsel. Existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by USCF. UNL will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and/or provide collateral or other credit support. Even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations. In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange-traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources. In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC swaps, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction. During the nine month reporting period ended September 30, 2024, UNL did not limit its OTC activities to EFRP transactions. UNL anticipates that the use of Other Natural Gas-Related Investments together with its investments in Futures Contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of UNL. However, there can be no assurance of this. OTC swaps may result in higher transaction-related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of Futures Contracts, which may impact UNL s ability to successfully track the Benchmark Futures Contracts. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures UNL maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in UNL s periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The duly appointed officers of USCF, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who perform functions equivalent to those of a principal executive officer and principal financial officer of UNL if UNL had any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of UNL s disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of UNL have been effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in UNL s internal control over financial reporting during UNL s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, UNL s internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. From time to time, UNL may be involved in legal proceedings arising primarily from the ordinary course of its business. UNL is not currently party to any material legal proceedings. In addition, USCF, as the general partner of UNL and the Related Public Funds may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business. Except as described herein, USCF is not currently party to any material legal proceedings. Optimum Strategies Action On April 6, 2022, USO and USCF were named as defendants in an action filed by Optimum Strategies Fund I, LP, a purported investor in call option contracts on USO (the Optimum Strategies Action ). The action was in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut at Civil Action No. 3:22-cv-00511. The Optimum Strategies Action asserted claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ), Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act CUSA ). It purported to challenge statements in registration statements that became effective in February 2020, March 2020, and on April 20, 2020, as well as public statements between February 2020 and May 2020, in connection with certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint was seeking damages, interest, costs, attorney s fees, and equitable relief. On March 15, 2023, the court granted the USO defendants motion to dismiss the complaint. In its ruling, the court granted the USO defendants motion to dismiss, with prejudice, the plaintiff s claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and a claim for control person liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Having dismissed all claims over which the court had original jurisdiction, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiff s state law claim under CUSA and dismissed the claim without prejudice. No notice of appeal was filed. Settlement of SEC and CFTC Investigations On November 8, 2021, USCF and USO announced a resolution with each of the SEC and the CFTC relating to matters set forth in certain Wells Notices issued by the staffs of each of the SEC and CFTC as more fully described below. On August 17, 2020, USCF, USO, and John Love received a Wells Notice from the staff of the SEC (the SEC Wells Notice ). The SEC Wells Notice stated that the SEC staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against USCF, USO, and Mr. Love alleging violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act ), and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Subsequently, on August 19, 2020, USCF, USO, and Mr. Love received a Wells Notice from the staff of the CFTC (the CFTC Wells Notice ). The CFTC Wells Notice stated that the CFTC staff made a preliminary determination to recommend that the CFTC file an enforcement action against USCF, USO, and Mr. Love alleging violations of Sections 4o(1)(A) and (B) and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the CEA ), 7 U.S.C. 6o(1)(A) and (B) and 9(1) (2018), and CFTC Regulations 4.26, 4.41, and 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. 4.26, 4.41, 180.1(a) (2019). On November 8, 2021, acting pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by USCF and USO, the SEC issued an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order pursuant to Section 8A of the 1933 Act, directing USCF and USO to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. 77q(a)(3) (the SEC Order ). In the SEC Order, the SEC made findings that, from April 24, 2020 to May 21, 2020, USCF and USO violated Section 17(a)(3) of 1933 Act, which provides that it is unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. USCF and USO consented to entry of the SEC Order without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, except as to jurisdiction.

 Separately, on November 8, 2021, acting pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by USCF, the CFTC issued an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the CEA, directing USCF to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 6o(1) (B), and CFTC Regulation 4.41(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. 4.41(a)(2) (the CFTC Order ). In the CFTC Order, the CFTC made findings that, from on or about April 22, 2020 to June 12, 2020, USCF violated Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA and CFTC Regulation 4.41(a)(2), which make it unlawful for any commodity pool operator CPO to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant and prohibit a CPO from advertising in a manner which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant, respectively. USCF consented to entry of the CFTC Order without admitting or denying the findings contained therein, except as to jurisdiction. Pursuant to the SEC Order and the CFTC Order, in addition to the command to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the 1933 Act, Section 4o(1)(B) of the CEA, and CFTC Regulation 4.14(a)(2), civil monetary penalties totaling two million five hundred thousand dollars 2,500,000) in the aggregate were required to be paid to the SEC and CFTC, of which one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars 1,250,000) was paid by USCF to each of the SEC and the CFTC, respectively, pursuant to the offsets permitted under the orders. In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation On June 19, 2020, USCF, USO, John P. Love, and Stuart P. Crumbaugh were named as defendants in a putative class action filed by purported shareholder Robert Lucas (the Lucas Class Action ). The Court thereafter consolidated the Lucas Class Action with two related putative class actions filed on July 31, 2020 and August 13, 2020, and appointed a lead plaintiff. The consolidated class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation , Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-04740. On November 30, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the Amended Lucas Class Complaint ). The Amended Lucas Class Complaint asserts claims under the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint challenges statements in registration statements that became effective on February 25, 2020 and March 23, 2020 as well as subsequent public statements through April 2020 concerning certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint purports to have been brought by an investor in USO on behalf of a class of similarly-situated shareholders who purchased USO securities between February 25, 2020 and April 28, 2020 and pursuant to the challenged registration statements. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint seeks to certify a class and to award the class compensatory damages at an amount to be determined at trial as well as costs and attorney s fees. The Amended Lucas Class Complaint named as defendants USCF, USO, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L.

 Wang Class Action On July 10, 2020, purported shareholder Momo Wang filed a putative class action complaint, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, against defendants USO, USCF, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis, Malcolm R. Fobes, III, ABN Amro, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Company, JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC, and Virtu Financial BD LLC, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California as Civil Action No. 3:20-cv-4596 (the Wang Class Action ). The Wang Class Action asserted federal securities claims under the 1933 Act, challenging disclosures in a March 19, 2020 registration statement. It alleged that the defendants failed to disclose to investors in USO certain extraordinary market conditions and the attendant risks that caused the demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The Wang Class Action was voluntarily dismissed on August 4, 2020. Mehan Action On August 10, 2020, purported shareholder Darshan Mehan filed a derivative action on behalf of nominal defendant USO, against defendants USCF, John P. Love, Stuart P. Crumbaugh, Nicholas D. Gerber, Andrew F Ngim, Robert L. Nguyen, Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis, and Malcolm R. Fobes, III (the Mehan Action ). The action is pending in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Alameda as Case No. RG20070732. The Mehan Action alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to USO and failed to act in good faith in connection with a March 19, 2020 registration statement and offering and disclosures regarding certain extraordinary market conditions that caused demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaint seeks, on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney s fees, and costs. All proceedings in the Mehan Action are stayed pending disposition of the motion(s) to dismiss in In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation . USCF, USO, and the other defendants intend to vigorously contest such claims. In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation On August 27, 2020, purported shareholders Michael Cantrell and AML Pharm. Inc.

Robinson in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York at Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06974 (the Cantrell Action and Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06981 (the AML Action ), respectively. The complaints in the Cantrell and AML Actions are nearly identical. They each allege violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and 21D of the 1934 Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and common law claims of breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. These allegations stem from USO s disclosures and defendants alleged actions in light of the extraordinary market conditions in 2020 that caused demand for oil to fall precipitously, including the COVID-19 global pandemic and the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war. The complaints seek, on behalf of USO, compensatory damages, restitution, equitable relief, attorney s fees, and costs. The plaintiffs in the Cantrell and AML Actions have marked their actions as related to the Lucas Class Action. The Court consolidated the Cantrell and AML Actions under the caption In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation , Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-06974 and appointed co-lead counsel. All proceedings in In re United States Oil Fund, LP Derivative Litigation are stayed pending disposition of the motion(s) to dismiss in In re: United States Oil Fund, LP Securities Litigation .

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in UNL s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed on February 29, 2024 (the Form 10-K ), except for the following: Geopolitical risk, including as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war and Middle East conflict, has the potential to create further supply disruptions and sanctions, which could lead to further volatility. The Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions brought by the United States and other countries against Russia and others, the terror attacks by Hamas on Israel and ensuing conflict in the Middle East, and other geopolitical tensions, political unrest, and attacks or threats of attack by terrorists, are factors that could contribute to supply constraints, worker shortages, infrastructure and manufacturing energy usage and increase volatility in certain commodity prices. The Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact the economies of Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle East conflict, any sanctions, future market or supply disruptions, and the potential for wider conflicts may increase financial market volatility generally, have severe adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and could lead to further volatility, including in the markets for commodities, commodity futures, and the NAV or share price of UNL. However, if a resolution to the conflicts were to occur, volatility could decrease and prices could decline in a short period of time. The longer-term impact on commodities and futures prices, including the prices of the Benchmark Futures Contracts, is difficult to predict and depends on a number of factors that may have a negative impact on UNL in the future. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. (a) None. (b) Not applicable. 
 (c) UNL does not purchase shares directly from its shareholders. In connection with its redemption of baskets held by Authorized Participants, UNL redeemed 4 baskets (comprising 200,000 shares) during the third quarter of the year ending December 31, 2024. The following table summarizes the redemptions by Authorized Participants during the three months ended September 30, 2024: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Total Number of Average Price Per Period Shares Redeemed Share 7/1/24 to 7/31/24 100,000 7.91 8/1/24 to 8/31/24 9/1/24 to 9/30/24 100,000 7.66 Total 200,000 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable.
