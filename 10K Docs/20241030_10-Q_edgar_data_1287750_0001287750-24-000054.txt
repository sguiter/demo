 Together with Varagon Capital Partners Varagon and its clients, the Company has co-invested through the Senior Direct Lending Program LLC (d/b/a the Senior Direct Lending Program or the SDLP ).

The SDLP has been capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of the Company and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required); therefore, although the Company owns more than of the voting securities of the SDLP, the Company does not believe that it has control over the SDLP (for purposes of the Investment Company Act or otherwise) because, among other things, these voting securities do not afford the Company the right to elect directors of the SDLP or any other special rights (see Note 4).

. The operating lease is included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and operating lease liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not have any finance leases. 
 
 The ROU asset represents the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the operating lease liability represents the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from such lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company s lease does not provide an implicit discount rate, and as such the Company uses its weighted average borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the remaining lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. The Company has elected as a practical expedient to treat non-lease components as part of the lease as these components are not significant when compared to the lease component. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded deferred tax liabilities of and , respectively, included within accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, for certain of the Company s taxable consolidated subsidiaries.

to , the investment advisory and management agreement was amended to reduce the Company s annual base management fee rate from to on all assets financed using leverage over x debt to equity. For all assets financed using leverage up to x debt to equity, the annual base management fee rate remains at . The base management fee is based on the average value of the Company s total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarters and is calculated by applying the applicable fee rate. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. See Note 5 for more information. 
 
 The income based fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, as defined in the investment advisory and management agreement, for the quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the administration agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the income based fee and capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred income feature (such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. The Company s investment adviser is not under any obligation to reimburse the Company for any part of the income based fee it received that were based on accrued income that the Company never actually received. 
 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, unrealized capital appreciation, unrealized capital depreciation or income tax expense related to realized gains and losses. Because of the structure of the income based fee, it is possible that the Company may pay such fees in a quarter where the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company earns pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, the Company will pay the applicable income based fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and/or unrealized capital losses. 
 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fee and capital gains incentive fee payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed hurdle rate of per quarter. If market credit spreads rise, the Company may be able to invest its funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which may increase the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for the Company s investment adviser to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an income based fee based on such net investment income. To the extent the Company has retained pre-incentive fee net investment income that has been used to calculate the income based fee, it is also included in the amount of the Company s total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) used to calculate the base management fee. 
 
 The Company pays its investment adviser an income based fee with respect to the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 
 No income based fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; 
 
 of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than in any calendar quarter. The Company refers to this portion of its pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than as the catch-up provision. The catch-up is meant to provide the Company s investment adviser with of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeded in any calendar quarter; and 
 
 of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds in any calendar quarter. 
 
 These calculations are adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter. 
 
 149 

of such amount, less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no capital gains incentive fee for such year. 
 
 The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company s portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
 
 The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Company s portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
 
 The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the Company s portfolio as of the applicable capital gains incentive fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company is required by GAAP to record an investment at its fair value as of the time of acquisition instead of at the actual amount paid for such investment by the Company (including, for example, as a result of the application of the asset acquisition method of accounting), then solely for the purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee, the accreted or amortized cost basis of an investment shall be an amount (the Contractual Cost Basis equal to (1) (x) the actual amount paid by the Company for such investment plus (y) any amounts recorded in the Company s financial statements as required by GAAP that are attributable to the accretion of such investment plus (z) any other adjustments made to the cost basis included in the Company s financial statements, including PIK interest or additional amounts funded (net of repayments) minus (2) any amounts recorded in the Company s financial statements as required by GAAP that are attributable to the amortization of such investment, whether such calculated Contractual Cost Basis is higher or lower than the fair value of such investment (as determined in accordance with GAAP) at the time of acquisition. 
 
 Income based fee Capital gains incentive fee(1) 
 ________________________________________ 
 
 (1) Calculated in accordance with GAAP as discussed below. 
 
 There was capital gains incentive fee payable to the Company s investment adviser as calculated under the investment advisory and management agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, in accordance with GAAP, the Company had cumulatively accrued a capital gains incentive fee of as of September 30, 2024. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the investment advisory and management agreement. This GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation, net of any expense associated with cumulative unrealized capital depreciation or appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Company to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate 
 150 

. The resulting accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. 
 
 Cash payment of any income based fee and capital gains incentive fee otherwise earned by the Company s investment adviser is deferred if during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made the sum of (a) the aggregate distributions to the Company s stockholders and (b) the change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fee and capital gains incentive fee payable during the period) is less than of the Company s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) at the beginning of such period. These calculations will be adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases.

 Changes in market yields, discount rates or EBITDA multiples, each in isolation, may change the fair value of certain of the Company s investments. Generally, an increase in market yields or discount rates or a decrease in EBITDA multiples may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain of the Company s investments. 
 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it. 
 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.

OVERVIEW 
 
 We are a specialty finance company that is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company incorporated in Maryland. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Investment Company Act ). 
 
 We are externally managed by Ares Capital Management LLC Ares Capital Management or our investment adviser ), a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation (NYSE: ARES) Ares Management ), a publicly traded, leading global alternative investment manager, pursuant to our investment advisory and management agreement. Ares Operations LLC Ares Operations or our administrator ), a subsidiary of Ares Management, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate. 

Since our initial public offering IPO on October 8, 2004 through September 30, 2024, our exited investments resulted in an asset level realized gross internal rate of return to us of approximately 13 (based on original cash invested, net of syndications, of approximately 47.2 billion and total proceeds from such exited investments of approximately 60.4 billion). Internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero. Internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments. Investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and/or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and, thus, a loss may have been realized. 
 
 Additionally, since our IPO on October 8, 2004 through September 30, 2024, our realized gains have exceeded our realized losses by approximately 0.9 billion (excluding a one-time gain on the acquisition of Allied Capital Corporation in April 2010 (the Allied Acquisition and realized gains/losses from the extinguishment of debt and other transactions). For the same time period, our average annualized net realized gain rate was approximately 0.8 (excluding a one-time gain on the Allied Acquisition and realized gains/losses from the extinguishment of debt and other transactions). Net realized gain/loss rates for a particular period are the amount of net realized gains/losses during such period divided by the average quarterly investments at amortized cost in such period. 
 188 

Information included herein regarding internal rates of return, realized gains and losses and annualized net realized gain rates are historical results relating to our past performance and are not necessarily indicative of future results, the achievement of which cannot be assured. 
 
 As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies and certain public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We also may invest up to 30 of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30 basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered eligible portfolio companies (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act. 
 
 We have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other requirements, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Pursuant to this election, we generally will not have to pay U.S. federal corporate-level taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders provided that we satisfy those requirements. 
 
 MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, leveraged corporate credit markets posted positive returns, driven by sustained economic growth, a healthy level of corporate earnings and further stability in the capital markets and U.S. banking system. With easing inflationary measures, the Federal Reserve softened its monetary policies and lowered the federal funds rate in support of its goals of maximum employment and returning inflation to its two percent objective.

We have commitments to fund various revolving and delayed draw senior secured and subordinated loans, including commitments to fund which are at (or substantially at) our discretion. Our commitment to fund delayed draw loans is triggered upon the satisfaction of certain pre-negotiated terms and conditions. Generally, the most significant and uncertain term requires the borrower to satisfy a specific use of proceeds covenant. The use of proceeds covenant typically requires the borrower to use the additional loans for the specific purpose of a permitted acquisition or permitted investment, for example. In addition to the use of proceeds covenant, the borrower is generally required to satisfy additional negotiated covenants (including specified leverage levels). We are also party to subscription agreements to fund equity investments. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on our unfunded commitments, including commitments to issue letters of credit, related to certain of our portfolio companies.

 Ares Capital Management employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative 
 192 

to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. The following is a description of each investment grade: 
 
 Investment grade Description 4 Involves the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. 3 Involves a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 3. 2 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due. For investments graded 2, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 1 Indicates that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 1, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. For investments graded 1, our investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 
 
 Set forth below is the grade distribution of our portfolio companies as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 Selected Financial Information 
 
 Pursuant to Rule 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X, selected financial information of IHAM, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below. 
 
 In conformity with GAAP, IHAM is required to consolidate entities in which IHAM has a direct or indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model, which include certain of the IHAM Vehicles (the Consolidated IHAM Vehicles ). As such, for GAAP purposes only, IHAM consolidates (a) entities in which it holds a majority voting interest or has majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity and (b) entities that it concludes are variable interest entities in which IHAM has more than insignificant economic 
 194 

interest and power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities, and for which IHAM is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. 
 
 When IHAM consolidates an IHAM Vehicle for GAAP purposes only, IHAM reflects the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Consolidated IHAM Vehicles on a gross basis, including the economic interests held by third-party investors in the Consolidated IHAM Vehicles as debt obligations, subordinated notes or non-controlling interests, in the consolidated IHAM financials below. All of the revenues earned by IHAM as the investment manager of the Consolidated IHAM Vehicles are eliminated in GAAP consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from and funded by third-party investors, the GAAP consolidation of an IHAM Vehicle does not impact the net income or loss attributable to IHAM. As a result, we believe an assessment of IHAM s business and the impact to our investment in IHAM is best viewed on a stand-alone basis as reflected in the first column in the tables below.

Senior Direct Lending Program 
 
 We have established a joint venture with Varagon to make certain first lien senior secured loans, including certain stretch senior and unitranche loans, primarily to U.S. middle-market companies. The joint venture is called the Senior Direct Lending Program, LLC (d/b/a the Senior Direct Lending Program or the SDLP ). In July 2016, we and Varagon and its clients completed the initial funding of the SDLP. The SDLP may generally commit and hold individual loans of up to 450 million. The SDLP is capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of ours and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required). 
 
 We provide capital to the SDLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the SDLP Certificates ), and Varagon and its clients provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and the SDLP Certificates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we and a client of Varagon owned 87.5 and 12.5 , respectively, of the outstanding SDLP Certificates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we and Varagon and its clients had agreed to make capital available to the SDLP of 6.2 billion and 6.2 billion, respectively, in the aggregate, of which 1.4 billion and 1.4 billion, respectively, is to be made available from us. This capital will only be committed to the SDLP upon approval of transactions by the investment committee of the SDLP. Below is a summary of the funded capital and unfunded capital commitments of the SDLP. 
 
 As of (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total capital funded to the SDLP(1) 4,900 5,361 Total capital funded to the SDLP by the Company(1) 1,274 1,328 Total unfunded capital commitments to the SDLP(2) 291 260 Total unfunded capital commitments to the SDLP by the Company(2) 68 60 
 ___________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) At principal amount. 
 
 (2) These commitments to fund delayed draw loans have been approved by the investment committee of the SDLP and will be funded if and when conditions to funding such delayed draw loans are met. 
 
 The SDLP Certificates pay a coupon equal to Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 8.0 and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the holders of the SDLP Certificates that is greater than the stated coupon. The SDLP Certificates are junior in right of payment to the senior notes and intermediate funding notes. 
 
 The amortized cost and fair value of our SDLP Certificates and our yield on our investment in the SDLP Certificates at amortized cost and fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total investment income 775 655 2,231 1,907 Total expenses 402 363 1,127 975 Net investment income before income taxes 373 292 1,104 932 Income tax expense, including excise tax 12 3 60 11 Net investment income 361 289 1,044 921 Net realized losses on investments, foreign currency and other transactions (24) (76) (30) (207) Net unrealized gains on investments, foreign currency and other transactions 57 287 165 395 Realized loss on extinguishment of debt (14) Net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations 394 500 1,165 1,109 
 
 Net income can vary substantially from period to period due to various factors, including acquisitions, the level of new investment commitments, the level of base interest rates and the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, comparisons of net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations may not be meaningful. 
 
 Investment Income 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest income from investments 568 495 1,620 1,441 Capital structuring service fees 38 20 124 51 Dividend income 151 128 441 372 Other income 18 12 46 43 Total investment income 775 655 2,231 1,907 
 
 Interest income from investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable period in 2023 primarily as a result of the increase in the average size of our portfolio. The weighted average yield on our portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained largely consistent with the comparable period in 2023. Interest income from investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to the increase in the average size of our portfolio as well as the impact of higher interest rates. The average size and weighted average yield of our portfolio at amortized cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Average size of portfolio(1) 25,141 21,775 23,878 21,690 Weighted average yield on portfolio 11.3 11.3 11.4 11.1

 (1) Includes non-interest earning investments. 
 
 204 

Capital structuring service fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to an increase in new investment commitments. The lower weighted average capital structuring service fee percentage during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a higher percentage of new investment commitments to existing portfolio companies, which generally resulted in lower fee opportunities as compared to the comparable periods in 2023. The new investment commitments and weighted average capital structuring service fee percentages for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 New investment commitments(1) 3,209 1,347 8,762 2,889 Weighted average capital structuring service fee percentages(1) 1.2 1.5 1.4 1.8

 Stated interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to the increase in the average principal amount of debt outstanding and the impact of higher interest rates on our floating debt obligations. Average debt outstanding and weighted average stated interest rate on our debt outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollar amounts in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Average debt outstanding 13,470 11,373 12,656 11,429 Weighted average stated interest rate on debt outstanding(1) 5.4 4.7 5.1 4.5 ________________________________________ 
 
 (1) The weighted average stated interest rate on our debt outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes the impact of interest rate swaps. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for more information on the interest rate swaps. 
 
 The base management fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to the increase in the average size of our portfolio. 
 
 The income based fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the comparable periods in 2023 primarily due to the pre-incentive fee net investment income, as defined in the investment advisory and management agreement, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 being higher than in the comparable periods in 2023. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the capital gains incentive fee calculated in accordance with GAAP was 7 million and 19 million, respectively, compared to 42 million and 40 million, respectively, in the comparable periods in 2023. The capital gains incentive fee accrual for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 changed from the comparable period in 2023 primarily due to net gains on investments, foreign currency, other transactions and the extinguishment of debt of 121 million compared to net gains of 188 million for the comparable period in 2023. The capital gains incentive fee accrued under GAAP includes an accrual related to unrealized capital appreciation, whereas the capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement does not. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. As of September 30, 2024, there was 106 million of capital gains incentive fee accrued in accordance with GAAP. As of September 30, 2024, there was no capital gains incentive fee actually payable under our investment advisory and management agreement. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for more information on the base management fee, income based fee and capital gains incentive fee. 
 
 Cash payment of any income based fee and capital gains incentive fee otherwise earned by our investment adviser is deferred if during the most recent four full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made the sum of (a) the aggregate distributions to our stockholders and (b) the change in net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any income based fee and capital gains incentive fee payable during the period) is 
 206 

less than 7.0 of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) at the beginning of such period. These calculations will be adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases. Any income based fee and capital gains incentive fee deferred for payment are carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such fees are payable under the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for more information on the related deferral terms. 
 
 Administrative and other fees represent fees paid to Ares Operations and our investment adviser for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Ares Operations and our investment adviser in performing their obligations under the administration agreement and the investment advisory and management agreement, respectively, including our allocable portion of the compensation, rent and other expenses of certain of our corporate officers and their respective staffs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for more information on the administrative and other fees. 
 
 Other general and administrative expenses include, among other costs, professional fees, insurance, fees and expenses related to evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies and independent directors fees. 
 
 Income Tax Expense, Including Excise Tax 
 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other requirements, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal corporate-level income taxes. 
 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward such taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4 excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net expense of 7 million and 24 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an expense of 2 million and 17 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax. 
 
 Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net tax expense of 5 million and 37 million, respectively, for these subsidiaries. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net tax expense (benefit) of 1 million and (6) million, respectively, for these subsidiaries. The income tax expense for our taxable consolidated subsidiaries will vary depending on the level of realized gains from the exits of investments held by such taxable subsidiaries during the respective periods.

 (in millions) Total Aggregate Principal Amount Committed/ Outstanding End of Revolving Period Maturity Date Revolving tranche April 12, 2028 April 12, 2029 March 31, 2026 March 31, 2027 March 31, 2025 March 31, 2026 3,400 Term loan tranche April 12, 2029 April 19, 2028 March 31, 2027 March 31, 2026 1,113 4,513 
 
 The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for a feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the overall size of the Revolving Credit Facility to a maximum of 6.7 billion. The interest rate charged on the Revolving Credit Facility is based on SOFR (or an alternative rate of interest for certain loans, commitments and/or other extensions of credit denominated in Sterling, Canadian Dollars, Euros and certain other foreign currencies) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 and an applicable spread of either 1.75 or 1.875 or an alternate base rate (as defined in the documents governing the Revolving Credit Facility) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 and an applicable spread of either 0.75 or 0.875 , in each case, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of (i) the greater of (a) the aggregate amount of revolving exposure and term loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and (b) 85 of the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility (or, if higher, the total revolving exposure) plus (ii) other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable spread in effect was . We are also required to pay a letter of credit fee of either 2.00 or 2.125 per annum on letters of credit issued, determined monthly based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the total commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt, if any, secured by the same collateral as the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375 per annum on any unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there was 1.7 billion outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and we were in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility.

 The Unsecured Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Unsecured Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not expressly subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 On October 8, 2024, we and Ares Capital CP entered into an agreement to amend the Revolving Funding Facility. The amendment, among other things, (a) increased the commitments under the Revolving Funding Facility from 1,775 million to 2,150 million, (b) extended the end of the reinvestment period from December 29, 2024 to October 8, 2027, (c) extended the stated maturity date from December 29, 2026 to October 8, 2029 and (d) adjusted the interest rate charged on the Revolving Funding Facility from an applicable SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 or a base rate plus an applicable spread of 1.90 per annum to an applicable SOFR or a base rate (as defined in the documents governing the Revolving Funding Facility) plus an applicable spread of 2.00 per annum and with no credit spread adjustment. The other terms of the Revolving Funding Facility remained materially unchanged. 
 
 In October 2024, we, through a wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary, priced a 544 million term debt securitization. The transaction is expected to close in November 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. A term debt securitization is also known as a collateralized loan obligation and is a form of secured financing incurred by us, which is consolidated by us and subject to our overall asset coverage requirement. 
 
 From October 1, 2024 through October 24, 2024, we made new investment commitments of approximately 408 million, of which approximately 320 million were funded. Of the approximately 408 million in new investment commitments, 55 were in first lien senior secured loans, 19 were in senior subordinated loans and 26 were in our subordinated loan investment in IHAM. All of the approximately 408 million in new investment commitments were floating rate. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 10.8 and the weighted average yield on total investments funded during the period at amortized cost was 10.8 . We may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. 
 
 From October 1, 2024 through October 24, 2024, we exited approximately 1.2 billion of investment commitments, including 458 million of loans sold to IHAM or certain vehicles managed by IHAM. Of the approximately 1.2 billion of exited investment commitments, 60 were first lien senior secured loans, 28 were second lien senior secured loans, 1 were subordinated certificates of the SDLP and 11 were our subordinated loan investment in IHAM. All of the approximately 1.2 
 219 

billion of exited investment commitments were floating rate. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 11.3 and the weighted average yield on total investments exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 11.3 . Of the approximately 1.2 billion of investment commitments exited from October 1, 2024 through October 24, 2024, we recognized total net realized gains of approximately 4 million, with no realized gains or losses recognized from the sale of loans to IHAM or certain vehicles managed by IHAM. 
 
 In addition, as of October 24, 2024, we had an investment backlog of approximately 2.8 billion. Investment backlog includes transactions approved by our investment adviser s investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a signed commitment have been issued, and therefore we believe are likely to close. The consummation of any of the investments in this backlog depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company, our acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. In addition, we may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments. We cannot assure you that we will make any of these investments or that we will sell all or any portion of these investments. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with our risk factors as disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on our critical accounting policies. 
 
 Investments 
 
 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment using the specific identification method without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Unrealized gains or losses primarily reflect the change in investment values, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, our board of directors designated our investment adviser as our valuation designee (the Valuation Designee to perform the fair value determinations for investments held by us without readily available market quotations, subject to the oversight of our board of directors. All investments are recorded at their fair value. 
 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, the Valuation Designee looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available (i.e., substantially all of our investments) are valued at least quarterly at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee, subject to the oversight of our board of directors, based on, among other things, the input of our independent third party valuation providers IVPs that have been engaged to support the valuation of such portfolio investments at least once during a trailing 12 month period (with certain de minimis exceptions) and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. The valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter by the Valuation Designee, and a portion of our investment portfolio at fair value is subject to review by an IVP each quarter, as discussed further below. However, we may use these IVPs to review the value of our investments more frequently, including in connection with the occurrence of significant events or changes in value affecting a particular investment. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm obtains an understanding of, and performs select procedures relating to, our valuation process within the context of performing our integrated audit. 
 
 As part of the valuation process, the Valuation Designee may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of our investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets, which may affect the price at which similar investments would trade in their principal markets and other relevant 
 220 

factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, the Valuation Designee considers the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the valuation. 
 
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, substantially all of our portfolio investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. 
 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. 
 
 The Valuation Designee, subject to the oversight of our board of directors, undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 
 Our quarterly valuation process begins with a preliminary valuation being prepared by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with our portfolio management and valuation team. 
 
 Preliminary valuations are reviewed and discussed by the valuation committee of the Valuation Designee. 
 
 For portfolio investments selected for review by an IVP, 
 
 Relevant information related to the portfolio investment is made available by the Valuation Designee to the IVP, who does not independently verify such information. 
 
 The IVP reviews and analyzes the information provided by the Valuation Designee, along with relevant market and economic data, and independently determines a range of values for each of the selected portfolio investments. 
 
 The IVP provides its analysis to the Valuation Designee to support the IVP s valuation methodology and calculations. 
 
 The valuation committee of the Valuation Designee determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio without a readily available market quotation in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the IVPs, where applicable. 
 
 For portfolio investments selected for review by an IVP, a positive assurance opinion or independent valuation report is issued by the IVP that confirms the fair value determined by the Valuation Designee for a selected portfolio investment is within the range of values independently calculated by such IVP. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
 We follow ASC 825-10, R ecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ASC 825-10 ), which provides companies the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. ASC 825-10 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and a better understanding of the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. We have not elected the ASC 825-10 option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. With the exception of the line items entitled other assets and debt, which are reported at amortized cost, the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities approximate fair value. 
 
 We also follow ASC 820-10, which expands the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an 
 221 

orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820-10, we have considered its principal market as the market in which we exit our portfolio investments with the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. In accordance with ASC 820-10, these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below: 
 
 Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. 
 
 Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 
 Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 
 In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Valuation Designee continues to employ the net asset valuation policy and procedures that have been reviewed by our board of directors in connection with their designation of our investment adviser as the valuation designee and are consistent with the provisions of Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and ASC 820-10. Consistent with its valuation policies and procedures, the Valuation Designee evaluates the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, the fair value of the investments must typically be determined using unobservable inputs. 
 
 Our portfolio investments (other than as described below in the following paragraph) are typically valued using two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value EV of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company s EBITDA (generally defined as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization). EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. The Valuation Designee may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues or, in the case of certain portfolio companies in the power generation industry, kilowatt capacity. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments, the value of debt investments in portfolio companies where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security, and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate EV. The second valuation technique is a yield analysis, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments in portfolio companies where we do not own a controlling equity position. To determine fair value using a yield analysis, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the yield analysis, the Valuation Designee considers the current contractual interest rate, the maturity and other terms of the investment relative to the risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, the Valuation Designee depends on primary market data, including newly funded transactions, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable. 
 
 For other portfolio investments such as investments in the SDLP Certificates and IHAM, discounted cash flow analysis is the primary technique utilized to determine fair value. Expected future cash flows associated with the investment are discounted to determine a present value using a discount rate that reflects estimated market return requirements. 
 
 See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on our valuation process.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. Uncertainty with respect to the fluctuations in global interest rates, inflationary pressures, the Russia-Ukraine war and more recently the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East introduced significant volatility in the financial markets, and the effects of this volatility has materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our market risks, including those listed below. For more information concerning these risks and their potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Risk Factors General Risk Factors Global economic, political and market conditions, including uncertainty about the financial stability of the United States, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations , Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Investments Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results and Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business Inflation has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 7, 2024. 
 
 Investment Valuation Risk 
 
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, substantially all of our portfolio investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our investment adviser, as the valuation designee, subject to the oversight of our board of directors based on, among other things, the input of the independent third-party valuation firms that have been engaged to support the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing 12-month period (with certain de minimis exceptions). Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates as well as Notes 2 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information relating to our investment valuation. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, including the current rising interest rate environment in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 7, 2024. 
 
 In a prolonged low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may be compressed, reducing our net income and potentially adversely affecting our operating results. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, such difference could potentially increase thereby increasing our net income as indicated per the table below. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 69 of the investments at fair value in our portfolio bore interest and dividends at variable rates (including our investment in the SDLP Certificates which accounted for 5 of our total investments at fair value), 14 bore interest at fixed rates, 9 were non-income producing, 1 were on non-accrual status and 7 was our equity investment in IHAM which generally pays a quarterly dividend. Additionally, excluding our investment in the SDLP Certificates, 99 of the remaining variable rate investments at fair value contained interest rate floors. The Facilities and the 2024-1 CLO Notes bear interest at variable rates with no interest rate floors. The Unsecured Notes bear interest at fixed rates, except that the January 2027 Notes, the March 2029 Notes and the July 2029 Notes have been swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate through interest rate swaps. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on our debt obligations. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on the interest rate swaps.

We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 balance sheet, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 (in millions) Basis Point Change Interest and Dividend Income Interest Expense(1) Net Income(2) Up 300 basis points 541 211 330 Up 200 basis points 360 141 219 Up 100 basis points 180 70 110 Down 100 basis points (179) (70) (109) Down 200 basis points (359) (141) (218) Down 300 basis points (536) (211) (325) 
 ________________________________________ 
 
 (1) Includes the impact to interest expense related to the interest rate swaps. 
 
 (2) Excludes the impact of the income based fee. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information on the income based fee. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we, our executive officers, directors and our investment adviser, its affiliates and/or any of their respective principals and employees are subject to legal proceedings, including those arising from our investments in our portfolio companies, and as a result, incur significant costs and expenses in connection with such legal proceedings. Legal proceedings may increase to the extent we find it necessary to foreclose or otherwise enforce remedies with respect to loans that are in default, which borrowers may seek to resist by asserting counterclaims and defenses against us or our investment adviser. 
 
 224 

We and our investment adviser are also subject to extensive regulation, which, from time to time, results in requests for information from us or our investment adviser or regulatory proceedings or investigations against us or our investment adviser, respectively. We incur significant costs and expenses in connection with any such information requests, proceedings and investigations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 We did not sell any equity securities during the period covered in this report that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 
 Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as part of our dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders, we did not purchase shares of our common stock in the open market in order to satisfy the reinvestment portion of our dividends. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 
 In January 2024, our board of directors authorized an amendment to our existing stock repurchase program to extend the expiration date of the program from February 15, 2024 to February 15, 2025. Under the program, we may repurchase up to 1.0 billion in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our sole discretion, based upon an evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. The stock repurchase program will be in effect through February 15, 2025, unless extended or until the approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase shares. The stock repurchase program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares of common stock or any shares of common stock at all. Consequently, we cannot assure stockholders that any specific number of shares of common stock, if any, will be repurchased under the stock repurchase program. The program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program was 1.0 billion. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 
 Not applicable. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 
 Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 
 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or executive officers or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.
