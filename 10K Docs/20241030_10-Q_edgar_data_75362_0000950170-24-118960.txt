Truck, Parts and Other sales and revenues 

The Company recognizes truck and parts sales as revenues when control of the products is transferred to customers which generally occurs upon shipment, except for certain truck sales which are subject to a residual value guarantee (RVG) by the Company. The standard payment term for trucks and aftermarket parts is typically within 30 days, but the Company may grant extended payment terms on selected receivables. The Company recognizes revenue for the invoice amount adjusted for estimated sales incentives and returns. Sales incentives and returns are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted to current period revenue when the most likely amount of consideration the Company expects to receive changes or becomes fixed. Truck and parts sales include a standard product warranty which is included in cost of sales. The Company has elected to treat delivery services as a fulfillment activity with revenues recognized when the customer obtains control of the product. Delivery revenue is included in revenues and the related costs are included in cost of sales. The Company is not disclosing truck order backlog, as a significant majority of the backlog has a duration of less than one year. Truck sales with RVGs that allow customers the option to return their truck are accounted for as a sale when the customer does not have an economic incentive to return the truck to the Company, or as an operating lease when the customer does have an economic incentive to return the truck. The estimate of customers economic incentive to return the trucks is based on an analysis of historical guaranteed buyback value and estimated market value. When truck sales with RVGs are accounted for as a sale, revenue is recognized when the truck is transferred to the customer less an amount for expected returns. Expected return rates are estimated by using a historical return rate. Aftermarket parts sales allow for returns which are estimated at the time of sale based on historical data. Parts dealer services and other revenues are recognized as services are performed.

. The Company defers revenue based on stand-alone observable selling prices when it receives payments in advance and generally recognizes the revenue on a straight-line basis over the warranty or R M contract periods. See Note F, Product Support Liabilities, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Also included are truck sales with an RVG accounted for as an operating lease. A liability is created for the residual value obligation with the remainder of the proceeds recorded as deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period, which typically ranges from three to . Deferred revenue related to trucks sold with an RVG was at September 30, 2024. The Company expects to recognize approximately of the remaining deferred revenue in 2024, in 2025, in 2026, in 2027 and in 2028. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total operating lease revenue from truck sales with RVGs was and , respectively, compared to and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s total commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value for contracts accounted for as a lease was at September 30, 2024. Revenue from winch sales and other is primarily derived from the industrial winch business. Winch sales are recognized when the product is transferred to a customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Also within this category are other revenues not attributable to a reportable segment. 
 Financial Services The Company s Financial Services segment products include loans to customers collateralized by the vehicles being financed, finance leases for retail customers and dealers, dealer wholesale financing which includes floating-rate wholesale loans to PACCAR dealers for new and used trucks, and operating leases which include rentals on Company owned equipment. Interest income from finance and other receivables is recognized using the interest method. Certain loan origination costs are deferred and amortized to interest income over the expected life of the contracts using the straight-line method which approximates the interest method. Operating lease rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Customer contracts may include additional services such as excess mileage, repair and maintenance and other services on which revenue is recognized when earned. The Company s full-service lease arrangements bundle these additional services. Rents for full-service lease contracts are allocated between lease and non-lease components based on the relative stand-alone price of each component. Taxes, such as sales and use and value added, which are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from the measurement of lease income and expenses. Recognition of interest income and rental revenue is suspended (put on non-accrual status) when the receivable becomes more than 90 days past the contractual due date or earlier if some other event causes the Company to determine that collection is not probable. Accordingly, finance receivables more than 90 days past due were accruing interest at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Recognition is resumed if the receivable becomes current by the payment of all amounts due under the terms of the existing contract and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable (if not contractually modified) or if the customer makes scheduled payments for three months and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable (if contractually modified). Payments received while the finance receivable is on non-accrual status are applied to interest and principal in accordance with the contractual terms. Finance leases are secured by the trucks and related equipment being leased and the lease terms generally range from three to depending on the type and use of the equipment. The lessee is required to either purchase the equipment or guarantee to the Company a stated residual value upon the disposition of the equipment at the end of the finance lease term. Operating lease terms generally range from three to . At the end of the operating lease term, the lessee has the option to return the equipment to the Company or purchase the equipment at its fair market value. The Company determines its estimate of the residual value of leased vehicles by considering the length of the lease term, the truck model, the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand. If the sales price of the truck at the end of the agreement differs from the Company s estimated residual value, a gain or loss will result. Future market conditions, changes in government regulations and other factors outside the Company s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts. Residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant.

Amortization, accretion, interest and dividend income and realized gains and losses are included in investment income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Gross realized gains were and and gross realized losses were and for the nine months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net unrealized gains on marketable equity securities were and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Unrealized losses 

The unrealized losses on marketable debt securities above were due to higher yields on certain securities. The Company did not identify any indicators of a credit loss in its assessments. Accordingly, allowance for credit losses was recorded at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company does not currently intend, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required, to sell the investment securities before recovery of the unrealized losses. The Company expects that the contractual principal and interest will be received on the investment securities.

, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. The allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves. The Company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for expected credit losses. Finance receivables that are evaluated individually consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. In general, finance receivables that are 90 days past due are placed on non-accrual status. Finance receivables on non-accrual status which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the Company will collect all principal and interest payments. Individually evaluated receivables on non-accrual status are generally considered collateral dependent. Large balance retail and all wholesale receivables on non-accrual status are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. Generally, the determination of reserves for large balance receivables on non-accrual status considers the fair value of the associated collateral. When the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the Company s amortized cost basis, no reserve is recorded. Small balance receivables on non-accrual status with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below. The Company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually evaluated and share similar risk characteristics on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data, current market conditions, and expected changes in future macroeconomic conditions that affect collectability. Historical credit loss data provides relevant information of expected credit losses. The historical information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, and the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse. The Company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. A projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the Company s borrowers and their ability to repay. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for changes in forecasted economic conditions that are specific to the industry and markets in which the Company conducts business. The Company utilizes economic forecasts from third-party sources and determines expected losses based on historical experience under similar market conditions. After determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management s estimate of expected credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio. In determining the fair value of the collateral, the Company uses a pricing matrix and categorizes the fair value as Level 2 in the hierarchy of fair value measurement. The pricing matrix is reviewed quarterly and updated as appropriate. The pricing matrix considers the make, model and year of the equipment as well as recent sales prices of comparable equipment sold individually, which is the lowest unit of account, through wholesale channels to the Company s dealers (principal market). The fair value of the collateral also considers the overall condition of the equipment. Accounts are charged off against the allowance for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, they are considered uncollectible, which generally occurs upon repossession of the collateral. Typically the timing between the repossession and charge-off is not significant. In cases where repossession is delayed (e.g., for legal proceedings), the Company records a partial charge-off. The charge-off is determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, to the amortized cost basis.

Credit Quality The Company s customers are principally concentrated in the transportation industry in North America, Europe, Australia and Brasil. The Company s portfolio assets are diversified over a large number of customers and dealers with no single customer or dealer balances representing over of the total portfolio assets. The Company retains as collateral a security interest in the related equipment. At the inception of each contract, the Company considers the credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors credit quality based on past due status and collection experience as there is a meaningful correlation between the past due status of customers and the risk of loss. The Company has three credit quality indicators: performing, watch and at-risk. Performing accounts pay in accordance with the contractual terms and are not considered high-risk. Watch accounts include accounts 31 to 90 days past due and large accounts that are performing but are considered to be high risk. Watch accounts are not collateral dependent. At-risk accounts are generally collateral dependent, including accounts over 90 days past due and other accounts on non-accrual status.

principal segments: Truck, Parts and Financial Services. The Company evaluates the performance of its Truck and Parts segments based on operating profits, which excludes investment income, other income and expense and income taxes. The Financial Services segment s performance is evaluated based on income before income taxes. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements as described in Note A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Truck and Parts The Truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality, light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks and the Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles, both of which are sold through the same network of independent dealers. These segments derive a large proportion of their revenues and operating profits from operations in North America and Europe. The Truck segment incurs substantial costs to design, manufacture and sell trucks to its customers. The sale of new trucks provides the Parts segment with the basis for parts sales that may continue over the life of the truck, but are generally concentrated in the first five years after truck delivery. To reflect the benefit the Parts segment receives from costs incurred by the Truck segment, certain expenses are allocated from the Truck segment to the Parts segment. The expenses allocated are based on a percentage of the average annual expenses for factory overhead, engineering, research and development and SG A expenses for the preceding five years. The allocation is based on the ratio of the average parts direct margin dollars (net sales less material and labor costs) to the total truck and parts direct margin dollars for the previous five years. The Company believes such expenses have been allocated on a reasonable basis. Truck segment assets related to the indirect expense allocation are not allocated to the Parts segment. Financial Services The Financial Services segment derives its earnings primarily from financing or leasing of PACCAR products and services provided to truck customers and dealers. Revenues are primarily generated from operations in North America and Europe. In Europe, the marketing of used trucks, including those units sold by the Truck segment subject to an RVG, is performed by the Financial Services segment. When a customer returns the truck at the end of the RVG contract, the Company s Truck segment records a reduction in an RVG liability and the Company s Financial Services segment records a used truck asset and revenue from the subsequent sale. Certain gains and losses from the sale of these used trucks are shared with the Truck segment.

Cumulative basis adjustment included in the carrying amount 

() 

The above table excludes the cumulative basis adjustments on discontinued hedge relationships of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Cash Flow Hedges Substantially all of the Company s interest-rate contracts and some foreign-exchange contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI. Amounts in AOCI are reclassified into net income in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company elected to exclude the forward premium component (excluded component) on some foreign-exchange cash flow hedges and amortize the excluded component over the life of the derivative instruments. The amortization of the excluded component is recognized in Interest and other (income) expenses, net in Truck, Parts and Other segment and Interest and other borrowing expenses in Financial Services segment in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is years.

Fair Value Disclosure of Other Financial Instruments For financial instruments that are not recognized at fair value, the Company uses the following methods and assumptions to determine the fair value. These instruments are categorized as Level 2, except cash which is categorized as Level 1 and fixed rate loans which are categorized as Level 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Carrying amounts approximate fair value. Financial Services Net Receivables: For floating-rate loans, floating-rate wholesale financing and operating lease and other trade receivables, carrying values approximate fair values. For fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated using the income approach by discounting cash flows to their present value based on assumptions regarding the credit and market risks to approximate current rates for comparable loans. Finance lease receivables and related allowance for credit losses have been excluded from the accompanying table. Debt: The carrying amounts of Financial Services commercial paper, variable rate bank loans and variable rate term notes approximate fair value. For fixed rate debt, fair values are estimated using the income approach by discounting cash flows to their present value based on current rates for comparable debt.

In South America, heavy-duty truck industry registrations in 2024 are projected to be 110,000 to 120,000 units compared to 105,000 in 2023, and in a similar range for 2025. Parts Outlook In 2024, PACCAR Parts sales are expected to increase 3-5 compared to 2023, reflecting stable demand. In 2025, PACCAR Parts sales could increase 3-5 from 2024 levels, depending on the economic conditions. Financial Services Outlook In 2024, average earning assets are expected to increase 8-11 compared to 2023. The used truck market has normalized in North America, but remains soft in Europe, which is reflected in PFS quarterly results this year. If freight transportation conditions decline due to a weaker economy, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current levels and new business volume would likely decline. In 2025, average earning assets are expected to be comparable to 2024. Capital Investments and R D Outlook PACCAR s excellent long-term profits, strong balance sheet and consistent focus on quality have enabled the Company to invest 8.4 billion in new and expanded facilities, innovative products and new technologies during the past decade. Capital investments in 2024 are expected to be 760 to 800 million and R D is expected to be 450 to 470 million. In 2025, capital investments are projected to be 700 to 800 million and R D is expected to be 480 to 530 million. PACCAR is investing in additional global engine manufacturing capacity, and in the construction of a new engine remanufacturing facility that will be located in Columbus, Mississippi. Truck factory investments include the expansion at Kenworth Chillicothe, Ohio, PACCAR Mexico, and the DAF electric truck assembly plant in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The Company expects to invest 600 to 900 million in its battery joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies, over the next few years. See the Forward-Looking Statements section of Management s Discussion and Analysis for factors that may affect these outlooks.

The Company s worldwide truck net sales and revenues in the third quarter decreased to 6.03 billion in 2024 from 6.64 billion in 2023, primarily due to lower truck unit deliveries in Europe and the U.S. and Canada. Revenues for the first nine months decreased to 19.15 billion in 2024 from 19.88 billion in 2023, primarily due to lower truck deliveries in Europe, partially offset by higher truck deliveries and average sales prices in the U.S. and Canada. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, Truck segment income before taxes and pretax return on revenues decreased primarily due to lower truck unit deliveries in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by higher truck unit deliveries in Mexico, South America, Australia and other for the third quarter, and by higher truck unit deliveries in the U.S. and Canada for the first nine months of 2024, respectively. The major factors for the Truck segment changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

 New loan and lease volume was 2.01 billion in the the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.90 billion in the third quarter of 2023, and for the first nine months of 2024 was 5.45 billion compared to 5.24 billion in 2023. The increase in new loan and lease volume for both periods reflected higher finance market share of new PACCAR truck sales, primarily in the U.S. and Canada and Brasil. The increase in equipment on operating lease volume reflected higher market demand and a higher amount financed per truck in all major markets. 

 - 41 - 

In the third quarter of 2024, PFS finance market share of new PACCAR truck sales was 26.9 compared to 23.7 in the third quarter of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, PFS finance market share of new PACCAR truck sales was 24.2 compared to 23.4 in the first nine months of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, PFS revenues increased to 536.1 million from 464.1 million in 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, PFS revenues increased to 1.56 billion from 1.33 billion in 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by portfolio growth in all markets except Europe. PFS income before income taxes decreased to 106.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 133.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, PFS income before income taxes decreased to 331.6 million from 427.3 million in 2023. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to lower operating lease margins, reflecting lower results on returned lease assets, partially offset by higher finance margins from a higher asset portfolio. Included in Financial Services, Other assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of 401.7 million at September 30, 2024 and 309.8 million at December 31, 2023. These trucks are primarily units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also include trucks acquired from repossessions or through acquisitions of used trucks in trades related to new truck sales and trucks returned from residual value guarantees (RVGs). The Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of 13.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to gains of 4.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, including 9.7 million of losses on multiple unit transactions in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were 2.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 and not significant for the third quarter of 2023. The Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of 37.5 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to gains of 51.2 million in the first nine months of 2023, including losses on multiple unit transactions of 27.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 4.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. Used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were 8.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2.4 million first nine months of 2023.

Average finance receivables increased 2.86 billion (excluding foreign exchange effects), increasing interest and fees by 53.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher average loan, finance lease and dealer wholesale balances. 

 Average debt balances increased 2.47 billion (excluding foreign exchange effects), increasing interest and other borrowing costs by 30.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting higher funding requirements for the portfolio from growth in loans, finance leases and dealer wholesale receivables. 

 Higher portfolio yields (7.4 in 2024 compared to 7.0 in 2023) increased interest and fees by 20.0 million. The higher portfolio yields were primarily due to higher market rates in all markets. 

 Higher borrowing rates (4.9 in 2024 compared to 4.2 in 2023) increased interest and other borrowing expenses by 23.4 million and were primarily due to higher debt market rates in all markets.

Higher sales volume, partially offset by lower market prices of used trucks on trade, increased revenues by 21.7 million and related depreciation and other expenses by 22.0 million. 

 Results on returned lease assets increased depreciation and other expenses by 15.8 million, primarily due to losses on sale of returned lease units in 2024 (compared to gains in 2023) and impairment on existing used truck inventories in Europe as a result of lower used truck market values. 

 Average operating lease assets decreased 337.0 million (excluding foreign exchange effects), which decreased revenues by 31.9 million and related depreciation and other expenses by 26.8 million. 

 Revenue per asset increased 19.3 million primarily due to higher average truck values financed. Cost per asset increased 18.4 million due to higher depreciation and operating expenses, mainly in Europe. 

 The currency translation effects on Operating lease, rental and other revenues reflects a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily Mexican peso, partially offset by an increase in the euro.

 Financial Services SG A for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 42.2 million from 38.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months, Financial Services SG A increased to 122.0 million in 2024 from 110.9 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and higher professional fees. As an annualized percentage of average earning assets, Financial Services SG A was .8 for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, and .9 for the same periods in 2023.

The increase in provision for losses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by portfolio growth, an increase in the Company s 30+ past due accounts and higher charge-offs in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. The increased charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 included one large fleet customer in the U.S. and one large fleet customer in Europe. The increased charge-offs in the first nine months of 2024 included three large fleet customers in the U.S. and the same large fleet customer in Europe. The higher charge-offs in both periods also reflected higher average loss severity in all markets from lower used truck market values. The Company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms.

Modification activity increased to 680.8 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 236.3 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in modifications for Commercial reasons primarily reflects higher volumes of refinancing, primarily in the U.S. The increase in both Insignificant delay modifications and Credit modifications reflect higher volumes of contract modifications in the U.S., Brasil and Europe.

Accounts 30+ days past due was 1.2 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 at December 31, 2023 and .8 at September 30, 2023. The increased percentage of past due accounts as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 is primarily due to two large fleet customers in the U.S. and Canada and two large fleet customers in Europe, partially offset by decreases in past due accounts in Mexico and Australia. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances. When the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified 18.5 million of accounts worldwide during the third quarter of 2024, 35.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 and 21.5 million during the third quarter of 2023 that were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:

The effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. The Company s annualized pre-tax return on average assets for Financial Services was 1.9 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.7 in the same period of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, annualized pre-tax return on average assets was 2.1 compared to 3.1 in 2023. The lower returns primarily reflect lower operating lease margin from lower results on returned lease assets.

Other Other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment. Other also includes non-service cost components of pension expense and a portion of corporate expense. Other sales represent less than 1 of consolidated net sales and revenues for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Other SG A increased to 19.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 10.7 million for the third quarter of 2023 and increased to 64.9 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 63.1 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses. For the third quarter of 2024, Other income before income taxes was 3.6 million compared to 1.6 million in 2023 primarily due to lower corporate expenses. For the first nine months of 2024, Other income before tax was 4.0 million compared to loss of 616.6 million in 2023, primarily due to the EC-related charge in the first quarter of 2023, which is discussed in Note M of the consolidated financial statements. Investment income for the third quarter increased to 108.7 million in 2024 compared to 80.8 million in 2023. For the first nine months, investment income increased to 290.0 million in 2024 from 192.5 million in 2023. The increase in both periods is primarily driven higher investment balances as well as higher yields on investment due to higher market interest rates, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 22.6 compared to 22.7 for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 22.6 compared to 21.9 for the first nine months of 2023. Included in the first quarter of 2023 was the EC-related charge of 600.0 million, which lowered the effective tax rate. Excluding the EC charge and related tax benefits, the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was 22.4 .

Operating activities: Cash provided by operations increased by 191.9 million to 3,195.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 3,003.3 million in 2023. The increased operating cash flow reflects higher net income by 106.5 million and 147.9 million higher cash provided from net income items not affecting cash, primarily deferred income taxes and the provision for losses on financial services receivables, partially offset by higher cash usage from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 62.5 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities are mainly due to decreases in accruals of 1,059.4 million, including the EC-related charge and product support liabilities, partially offset by lower increases in trade and other receivables of 481.4 million, lower cash outflow for inventories of 363.7 million, and lower increases in wholesale receivables on new trucks of 169.4 million in the Financial Services segment. Investing activities: Cash used in investing activities increased by 824.2 million to 2,755.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 1,931.1 million in 2023. The increase in net cash used in investing activities reflects increased purchases of marketable securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities, of 505.4 million, increased acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of 235.5 million and cash contributed to the battery manufacturing joint venture, Amplify Cell Technologies, of 125.8 million. Financing activities: Cash used in financing activities was 766.4 million for the first nine months of 2024, 925.9 million higher than the 159.5 million provided in 2023. The increase reflects higher cash dividends and lower net borrowing activity. In the first nine months of 2024, the Company paid 2.13 billion in dividends compared to 1.38 billion in 2023, due to a higher year-end dividend paid in January 2024. Cash provided by borrowing activities was 1.32 billion in 2024, 172.9 million lower than the cash provided by borrowing activities of 1.50 billion in 2023. Credit Lines and Other The Company has line of credit arrangements of 5.30 billion, of which 4.73 billion were unused at September 30, 2024. Included in these arrangements are 4.00 billion of committed bank facilities, of which 1.50 billion expires in June 2025, 1.25 billion expires in June 2027 and 1.25 billion expires in June 2029. The Company intends to extend or replace these credit facilities on or before expiration to maintain facilities of similar amounts and duration. These credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. There were no borrowings under the committed bank facilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On December 4, 2018, PACCAR s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 500.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has repurchased 110.0 million of shares under this plan. There were no repurchases made under this plan during the first nine months of 2024. Truck, Parts and Other The Company provides funding for working capital, capital expenditures, R D, dividends, stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations. Management expects this method of funding to continue in the future.

Investments for manufacturing property, plant and equipment in the first nine months of 2024 were 562.8 million compared to 471.7 million for the same period of 2023. Over the past decade, the Company s combined investments in worldwide capital projects and R D totaled 8.27 billion and have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and enhanced the quality and operating efficiency of the Company s premium products. In 2024, total capital investments for PACCAR are expected to be 760 to 800 million and R D is expected to be 450 to 470 million. In 2025, capital investments are expected to be 700 to 800 million and R D is expected to be 480 to 530 million. The Company is increasing its investment in advanced new trucks and powertrains, enhanced manufacturing capabilities and capacity, and aftermarket distribution capabilities and capacity. Financial Services The Company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets and, to a lesser extent, bank loans. In November 2021, the Company s U.S. finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Corp. (PFC), filed a shelf registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFC as of September 30, 2024 was 7.15 billion. The registration expires in November 2024 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period. The Company intends to file a new shelf registration in November. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s European finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Europe, had 599.7 million available for issuance under a 2.50 billion medium-term note program listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. This program has been renewed through the filing of a new listing, which expires in July 2025. In August 2021, PACCAR Financial Mexico registered a 10.00 billion Mexican peso program with the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores to issue medium-term notes and commercial paper. The registration expires in August 2026 and limits the amount of commercial paper (up to one year) to 5.00 billion Mexican pesos. At September 30, 2024, 4.07 billion Mexican pesos were available for issuance. In August 2018, the Company s Australian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Pty. Ltd. (PFPL Australia), established a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFPL Australia as of September 30, 2024 was 700.0 million Australian dollars. In May 2021, the Company s Canadian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Ltd. (PFL Canada), established a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. There were no borrowings under this program as of September 30, 2024. The Company s Brazilian subsidiary, Banco PACCAR S.A., established a lending program in December 2021 with the local development bank, Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES) for qualified customers to receive preferential conditions and generally market interest rates. The program is limited to 2.51 billion Brazilian reais and has 1.05 billion Brazilian reais outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The Brazilian subsidiary also established a Letra Financeira (LF) program in May 2024 and the program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. A total of 500.0 million Brazilian reais medium-term notes were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The Company believes its cash balances and investments, collections on existing finance receivables, committed bank facilities and current investment-grade credit ratings of A+/A1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the Company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability. In the event of a decrease in the Company s credit ratings or a disruption in the financial markets, the Company may not be able to refinance its maturing debt in the financial markets. In such circumstances, the Company would be exposed to liquidity risk to the degree that the timing of debt maturities differs from the timing of receivable collections from customers. The Company believes its various sources of liquidity, including committed bank facilities, would continue to provide it with sufficient funding resources to service its maturing debt obligations.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: This Form 10-Q includes adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) , which are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), since they exclude a charge for EC-related claims. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Adjustment for the EC-related claims relates to a pre-tax charge of 600.0 million 446.4 million after-tax) for estimable total costs recorded in Interest and other (income) expenses, net in the first quarter 2023. Management utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding a significant non-recurring charge that is not representative of underlying operating trends. Reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted shares (non-GAAP) are as follows:

If there has not been a first Interest Payment Date, the Reference Rate shall be the Reference Rate applicable to the first Floating Rate Interest Period. For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment pursuant to this final paragraph of Condition 7(h)(i) shall apply to the immediately following Interest Period only. Any subsequent Interest Period may be subject to the subsequent operation of this Condition 7(h)(i). (ii) Successor Rate or Alternative Rate 

 If the Issuer, following consultation with the Independent Adviser and acting in good faith, determines that: (A) there is a Successor Rate, then such Successor Rate shall (subject to adjustment as provided in Condition 7(h)(iii)) subsequently be used in place of the Original Reference Rate to determine the Rate of Interest (or the relevant component part thereof) for all future payments of interest on the Notes (subject to the operation of this Condition 7(h)); or 

 (B) there is no Successor Rate but that there is an Alternative Rate, then such Alternative Rate shall (subject to adjustment as provided in Condition 7(h)(iii)) subsequently be used in place of the Original Reference Rate to determine the Rate of Interest (or the relevant component part thereof) for all future payments of interest on the Notes (subject to the operation of this Condition 7(h)). 

 (iii) Adjustment Spread 

- 23 - 

If the Issuer, following consultation with the Independent Adviser and acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, determines (x) that an Adjustment Spread is required to be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be) and (y) the quantum of, or a formula or methodology for determining, such Adjustment Spread, then such Adjustment Spread shall be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be). (iv) Benchmark Amendments 

 If any Successor Rate, Alternative Rate or Adjustment Spread is determined in accordance with this Condition 7(h) and the Issuer, following consultation with the Independent Adviser and acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, determines (i) that amendments to these Conditions are necessary to ensure the proper operation of such Successor Rate, Alternative Rate and/or Adjustment Spread (such amendments, the Benchmark Amendments and (ii) the terms of the Benchmark Amendments, then the Issuer shall, subject to giving notice thereof in accordance with Condition 7(h)(v), without any requirement for the consent or approval of Noteholders, vary these Conditions to give effect to such Benchmark Amendments with effect from the date specified in such notice. In connection with any such variation in accordance with this Condition 7(h)(iv), the Issuer shall comply with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Notes are for the time being listed or admitted to trading. (v) Notices, etc. 

 Any Successor Rate, Alternative Rate, Adjustment Spread and the specific terms of any Benchmark Amendments determined under this Condition 7(h) will be notified promptly by the Issuer to the Calculation Agent, the Paying Agents and, in accordance with Condition 18, the Noteholders. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the effective date of the Benchmark Amendments, if any. (vi) Survival of Original Reference Rate 

 Without prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer under Conditions 7(h)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the Original Reference Rate and the fallback provisions provided for in Conditions 7(c)(iv) and (v) will continue to apply unless and until the Calculation Agent has been notified of the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be), and any Adjustment Spread (if applicable) and Benchmark Amendments, in accordance with Condition 7(h)(v). (i) Maximum or Minimum Rate of Interest : If any Maximum Rate of Interest or Minimum Rate of Interest is specified in the relevant Pricing Supplement, then the Rate of Interest shall in no event be greater than the maximum or be less than the minimum so specified. Unless otherwise stated in the relevant Pricing Supplement, the Minimum Rate of Interest shall be deemed to be zero. 

 (j) Calculation of Interest Amount : The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after the time at which the Rate of Interest is to be determined in relation to each Interest Period, calculate the Interest Amount payable in respect of each Note for such Interest Period.
