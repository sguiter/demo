This Form 10-Q/A is also being updated to reflect the recognition of fraud losses in the appropriate periods, including opening equity in the earliest period presented, for the employee loan fraud discovered by the Company in June of 2023 as initially described in the Company s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2023. The Original 10-Q reflected the fraud losses in each period presented and this Form 10-Q/A reflects final adjustments to those amounts previously reported. Background of the Restatement As previously reported in the Company s Form 8-K filed on March 1, 2024, as part of the Company s year-end reporting process in the first quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the transfer of certain loans from Primis Bank to other financial institutions in the first, second, and third quarter of 2023 did not qualify for sales treatment under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP and should have been accounted for as secured borrowings. Also, as previously reported in the Company s Form 8-K filed on August 12, 2024, the Company completed its initial consultation process with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC related to the accounting for its Consumer Program loan portfolio. The Company received a non-objection from the SEC to the Company s accounting conclusions required to correct the prior accounting for the Consumer Program. As a result, in consultation with the Company s Audit Committee to its Board of Directors and its independent registered public accounting firm, Forvis Mazars, LLP, management determined that the corrections to the Consumer Program accounting was material to the financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, which are also being restated in this Form 10-Q/A.

 ) reporting units as of September 30, 2023. The testing for Primis Mortgage Company concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying amount and impairment charge was required. The Company s testing of the Primis Bank reporting unit revealed that its carrying amount was in excess of its calculated fair value as of September 30, 2023, resulting in an impairment charge. The Company s impairment testing included the use of three approaches, each receiving various weightings to determine an ultimate fair value estimate: (1) the comparable transactions method that is based on comparison to pricing ratios recently paid in the sale or merger of comparable banking institutions; (2) the public market peers control premium approach that is based on market pricing ratios of public banking companies adjusted for an industry based control premium, and (3) a discounted cash flow method (an income method), taking into consideration expectations of the Company s growth and profitability going forward. The results of the combined weighted approaches indicated that the Primis Bank reporting unit s fair value was approximately less than its book value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million. This was a non-cash charge to earnings and had no impact on tangible or regulatory capital, cash flows or the Company s liquidity position. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing as of September 30, 2023 will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Changes in assumptions, market data (for market-based assessments), or the discount rate (for income based assessments) could produce different results that lead to higher or lower fair value determinations compared to the results of the annual impairment testing performed as of September 30, 2023. million and million in principal balance of loans to other financial institutions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, that were accounted for as secured borrowings. As of September 30, 2023 the amortized cost of those loans recorded in loans held for investment in our balance sheet was million. of the loans were past due or on nonaccrual as of September 30, 2023 and we had charge-offs of these loans during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 7 Debt and Other Borrowings for additional information on transfers accounted for as secured borrowings.

 million in principal balance of loans to third-parties during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 that met the requirements to be accounted for as a sale. The Company retained servicing rights on the loans sold and recorded a servicing asset for certain of the sold loans at the time of sale. Subsequent to the date of transfer, the Company has elected to measure servicing assets under the amortization method. Under the amortization method, servicing assets are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. The amortization of servicing assets is analyzed each reporting period and is adjusted to reflect changes in prepayment speeds, as well as other factors. Servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of those assets. Impairment is determined by assessing the servicing assets based on groupings of predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate and loan type. If, by servicing asset grouping, the carrying amount of the servicing assets exceeds fair value, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to earnings. The valuation allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. The Company recorded impairment of its servicing assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Servicing assets are included in other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had the following activity in regard to its servicing assets (amounts in thousands): Amortization ) ) Ending Balance million. The fraud dated back to the origination of several loans to a customer in 2010. Management believes, on the advice of its counsel, its insurance broker and a third party forensic auditor, that the losses are recoverable under the Company s insurance policies and is working through the claims process. The Company has evaluated the effect of the error, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and believes the impact to prior years is immaterial to each respective period assessed. However, the Company s quantitative and qualitative assessments of the fraud losses on its projected 2023 annual earnings was expected to be material at the time the evaluation was performed as of June 30, 2023. Accordingly, the Company made the decision to report the losses in the respective periods in which they were incurred in its future Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filings by revising impacted periods beginning with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of June 30, 2023. For all of its filings on and after June 30, 2023, the Company revised opening retained earnings of the earliest period presented for losses incurred in earlier periods and revised all prior periods presented in the filing for losses incurred related to the period. Accordingly, the Company has revised prior periods presented in this Form 10-Q/A to reflect the fraud losses in the respective period incurred, with any losses incurred prior to January 1, 2022 adjusted in the January 1, 2022 opening retained earnings balance, as previously reported in the Company s restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The accounting matters underlying the Company s conclusion related to transfers of loans by the Company s subsidiary, Primis Bank, of approximately million (the Transferred Loans to other financial institution during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As part of the Company s 2023 year-end reporting process in the first quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the transfer of the Transferred Loans from Primis Bank to the other financial institutions did not qualify for sales treatment under U.S. GAAP and should have been accounted for as secured borrowings. The Company s management team then undertook extensive discussions with Forvis regarding the effect of the mischaracterization of the transfers on the Company s reported financial results, and ultimately determined that the Impacted Financial Statements should be restated. Additionally, during the 2023 annual independent audit of the Company by Forvis, the Company pursued a pre-clearance process with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC related to accounting for the Consumer Program loan portfolio as more fully described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company received a non-objection from the SEC to the Company s accounting conclusions required to correct the prior accounting for the Consumer Program. As a result, in consultation with the Company s Audit Committee to its Board of Directors and its independent registered public accounting firm, Forvis, management determined that the corrections to the Consumer Program accounting was material to the financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, which are also being restated in this Form 10-Q/A..

Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. With regard to U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost basis of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to securities issued by States and political subdivisions and other held-to-maturity securities, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities and (iv) internal forecasts. As of September 30, 2023, Primis did not have a material allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities. The unrealized losses related to investment securities available-for-sale as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and do not indicate credit-related impairment. Primis performs quantitative and qualitative analysis in this determination. As a result of the Company s analysis, none of the securities were deemed to require an allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2023

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. In determining whether or not a borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations for each class of loans, we consider the borrower s

Modifications Provided to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty The Bank determines that a borrower may be experiencing financial difficulty if the borrower is currently delinquent on any of its debt, or if the Bank is concerned that the borrower may not be able to perform in accordance with the current terms of the loan agreement in the foreseeable future. Many aspects of the borrower s financial situation are assessed when determining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty, particularly as it relates to commercial borrowers due to the complex nature of the loan structure, business/industry risk and borrower/guarantor structures. Concessions may include the reduction of an interest rate at a rate lower than current market rates for a new loan with similar risk, extension of the maturity date, reduction of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. When evaluating whether a concession has been granted, the Bank also considers whether the borrower has provided additional collateral or guarantors and whether such additions adequately compensate the Bank for the restructured terms, or if the revised terms are consistent with those currently being offered to new loan customers. The assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the time a concession has been granted is subjective in nature and management s judgment is required when determining whether the concession results in a modification that is accounted for as a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan under U.S. GAAP. Although each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, loans modified as a result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are typically modified through reductions in interest rates, reductions in payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions in term maturity. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, on an amortized cost basis, other consumer loans totaling million were modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This represents of the other consumer loan portfolio.

Table of Contents 
 of the other consumer loans, totaling million in amortized cost, were to one borrower and received payment deferrals for three months, with principal and interest payments resuming in August 2023. Total contractual payments for these loans for the quarter, prior to modification, would have been approximately thousand. Both loans are current on principal and interest following the deferral period. The third other consumer loan modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty had an amortized cost of million and the Company reduced monthly payments on the loan for the remaining 84-month term with no change to the original rate or maturity. The contractual payments for the quarter would have totaled approximately thousand if the modification had not been provided. The loan is paying as agreed following the modification. An existing modification of a 1-4 family residential loan in the first quarter of 2023, with an amortized cost of million, resumed contractual payments in August following its payment deferral period and has experienced no payment delinquencies since the deferral period ended. This modification is of the 1-4 family residential loan portfolio. loans modified in the second quarter of 2023 from our owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio with an amortized cost balance of million are paying as agreed following the modifications. These loans represent of the owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio. The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies certain loans by providing principal forgiveness. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the loan is written off against the allowance. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. If it is determined that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. At that time, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. Credit Quality Indicators Through its system of internal controls, Primis evaluates and segments loan portfolio credit quality using regulatory definitions for Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Special Mention loans are considered to be criticized. Substandard and Doubtful loans are considered to be classified. Special Mention loans are loans that have a potential weakness that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position. Substandard loans may be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful loans have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable or improbable. Primis had loans classified as Doubtful as of September 30, 2023 or December 31, 2022. In monitoring credit quality trends in the context of assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on loans, we monitor portfolio credit quality by the weighted-average risk grade of each class of loan.

Allowance For Credit Losses Loans The allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. In calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. For allowance modeling purposes, our loan pools include but are not limited to (i) commercial real estate - owner occupied, (ii) commercial real estate - non-owner occupied, (iii) construction and land development, (iv) commercial, (v) agricultural loans, (vi) residential 1-4 family and (vii) consumer loans. We periodically reassess each pool to ensure the loans within the pool continue to share similar characteristics and risk profiles and to determine whether further segmentation is necessary. For each loan pool, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of inputs: (i) probability of default, (ii) probability of attrition, (iii) loss given default and (iv) exposure at default. Internal data is supplemented by, but not replaced by, peer data when required, primarily to determine the probability of default input. The various pool-specific inputs may be adjusted for current macroeconomic assumptions. Significant macroeconomic variables utilized in our allowance models include, among other things, (i) Virginia Gross Domestic Product, (ii) Virginia House Price Index, and (iii) Virginia unemployment rates. Management qualitatively adjusts allowance model results for risk factors that are not considered within our quantitative modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. Qualitative factor Q-Factor adjustments are driven by key risk indicators that management tracks on a pool-by-pool basis.

Mortgage Banking Derivatives and Financial Instruments The Company enters into IRLCs interest rate lock commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time (generally between 30 and 90 days), with borrowers who have applied for a loan and have met certain credit and underwriting criteria. The IRLCs are adjusted for estimated costs to originate the loan as well as the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC (the pullthrough rate). Estimated costs to originate include loan officer commissions and overrides. The pullthrough rate is estimated on changes in market conditions, loan stage, and actual borrower behavior using a historical analysis of IRLC closing rates. The Company obtains an analysis from a third party on a monthly basis to support the reasonableness of the pullthrough estimate. Best efforts and mandatory forward loan sale commitments are commitments to sell individual mortgage loans using both best efforts and mandatory delivery at a fixed price to an investor at a future date.

The Company has exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non-performance by its trading counterparties in derivative instruments that the Company uses in its rate risk management activities. The Company manages this credit risk by selecting only counterparties that the Company believes to be financially strong, spreading the risk among multiple counterparties, by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty and by entering into netting agreements with counterparties, as appropriate.

Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. Allowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same methodology as described for loans in Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, as if such commitments were funded. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is reflected in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

Commitments are made predominately for adjustable rate loans, and generally have fixed expiration dates of up to three months or other termination clauses and usually require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. We had million of Primis mortgage loan commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2023, all of which contractually expire within thirty years. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds totaling million and million, respectively, not all of which will ultimately be drawn. Virtually all of our unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds are variable rate. The amount of certificate of deposit accounts maturing in less than one year was million as of September 30, 2023, including million of brokered CDs. Management anticipates that funding requirements for these commitments can be met in the normal course. Primis also had commitments on the subscription agreements entered into for investments in non-marketable equity securities of million and million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

 As part of a cost saving initiative, the Bank consolidated eight branch locations, reducing total branches from thirty-two to twenty-four, in late October 2023. While Primis Bank offers a wide range of commercial banking services, it focuses on making loans secured primarily by commercial real estate and other types of secured and unsecured commercial loans to small and medium-sized businesses in a number of industries, as well as loans to individuals for a variety of purposes. Primis Bank invests in real estate-related securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage backed securities. Primis Bank s principal sources of funds for loans and investing in securities are deposits and, to a lesser extent, borrowings. Primis Bank offers a broad range of deposit products, including checking (NOW), savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Primis Bank actively pursues business relationships by utilizing the business contacts of its senior management, other bank officers and its directors, thereby capitalizing on its knowledge of its local market areas. Current Economic Envir onment U.S. economic growth accelerated in the third quarter of 2023, with Real Gross Domestic Product growing by an annualized 4.9 . According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the rate of unemployment was 3.8 in September 2023 and nonfarm payrolls grew at a robust pace. The Federal Reserve (the Fed has raised interest rates 525 bps in total since March of 2022, a pace that has not been experienced in more than 40 years, and sits at a range of 5.25 to 5.50 . Inflation, while beginning to show signs of moderating, remains higher than the Fed s long term target rate of 2.0 and the Fed appears committed to maintaining high rates until inflation is back at their target rate. The Fed has indicated that future rate adjustments will be data-dependent. Continued higher inflation, as well as strong employment numbers, could lead to at least one more rate increase in 2023 or early 2024. This higher rate environment is continuing to put strong margin pressure on all banks, including Primis, as the cost of deposits has increased alongside the Fed rate increases while many loans in banks portfolios are fixed due to borrowers locking in historic low rates in the past few years. However, loan growth in the current environment will benefit from the higher rates and should assist in partially offsetting growth in deposit costs. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Revised and Restated) Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 6.0 million, or 0.24 basic and diluted loss per share, compared to net income of 2.9 million, or 0.12 basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 0.3 million, or 0.01 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to 12.1 million, or 0.49 basic diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Total assets as of September 30, 2023 were 3.8 billion, an increase of 7.6 compared to December 31, 2022. Total loans, excluding Paycheck Protection Program PPP balances as of September 30, 2023, were 3.2 billion, an increase of 234.2 million, or 8 , from December 31, 2022. Total deposits were 3.3 billion at September 30, 2023, an increase of 21 compared to December 31, 2022. Non-time deposits increased to 2.84 billion at September 30, 2023, an increase of 584.1 million, or 26 , compared to December 31, 2022. The ratio of gross loans to deposits declined to 97 at September 30, 2023, from 108 at December 31, 2022. Net interest margin of 2.70 in the third quarter of 2023 was down from 3.53 in the third quarter of 2022 and up from 2.36 in the second quarter of 2023. Allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.13 at September 30, 2023, compared to 1.17 at December 31, 2022. We began to realize costs savings from administrative reductions and other cost controls with noninterest expense, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, of 25.8 million in the third quarter of 2023 versus 30.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. Asset quality improved meaningfully from year end with nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets (excluding SBA guarantees) at 0.51 at September 30, 2023 compared to 0.98 at December 31, 2022.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Revised and Restated) Net Income (Loss) Three-Month Comparison. Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 6.0 million, or 0.24 basic and diluted loss per share, compared to net income of 2.9 million, or 0.12 basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The 307 decrease in net income (loss) during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was driven by a 11.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter. Nine-Month Comparison. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 0.3 million, or 0.01 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to 12.1 million, or 0.49 basic and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The 97 decrease in net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily related to a 11.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was also driven by higher noninterest expenses from an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense due to the growth of Primis Mortgage, higher data processing expense driven by the increase in customer accounts and related transactions on our digital deposit platform, and an increase in provision for loan losses associated with several specific loan relationships in the current year, partially offset by higher mortgage banking income due to the growth of Primis Mortgage and an increase in Consumer Program derivative income due to higher origination volume during the year of Consumer Program loans with 0 promotional interest rates. Net Interest Income Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Three-Month Comparison. Net interest income was 24.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 27.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Our net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 2.70 , compared to 3.53 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Net interest margin for three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was affected primarily by the interest spread being less, indicative of the cost of interest bearing liabilities increasing more than the yield on interest bearing assets. We also had interest-bearing liabilities grow, on average, quicker than interest-earning assets over the periods. Total income on interest-earning assets was 48.0 million and 32.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as average interest-earning assets grew approximately 528 million. The yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.33 and 4.20 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Increase in yield on average interest-earnings assets was driven by higher rates on cash and loans in the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits increased 239 basis points to 3.03 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 0.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as average interest-bearing deposits grew approximately 795 million. The increase in interest expense was driven by higher costs in every interest-bearing category with the largest driver being an increase in average savings deposits of 485 million with an average increase in cost of these deposits of 355 basis points. This increase was primarily a result of the use of our digital deposit platform by new and existing customers which generated approximately 1.0 billion in new deposits during the first quarter of 2023.

 Nine-Month Comparison. Net interest income was 73.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 74.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Our net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 2.61 , compared to 3.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The combination in the industry of growth in deposit account rates and consumer preferences shifting from non-interest bearing to higher rate products impacted interest expense and net interest income during the period. Net interest margin was further affected by excess cash balances during the first half of the year, that are part of average other earning assets that earned lower rates compared to the rates earned by our loan portfolio and paid on the related deposits that brought the cash onto the balance sheet. Total income on interest-earning assets was 142.5 million and 87.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, driven by average interest-earning asset growth of 686 million. The yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.10 and 3.82 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Increase in yield on average interest-earnings assets was driven by higher rates on cash and loans in 2023 compared to 2022. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits increased 233 basis points to 2.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 0.51 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as average interest-bearing deposits grew approximately 792 million. The increase was driven by higher costs in every deposit category with the largest driver being an increase in average savings deposits of 553 million with an average increase in cost of those

 deposits of 352 basis points. This increase was primarily a result of the aforementioned growth of the digital deposit platform. Average loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 3.1 billion, compared to 2.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and the yield on the loans grew by 102 basis points.

 (1) Includes loan fees in both interest income and the calculation of the yield on loans. (2) Calculations include non-accruing loans in average loan amounts outstanding. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses is a current charge to earnings made in order to adjust the allowance for credit losses for current expected losses in the loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of lending, historical loan experience and other known internal and external factors affecting loan collectability. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated by segmenting the loan portfolio by loan type and applying risk factors to each segment. The risk factors are determined by considering historical loss data, peer data, as well as applying management s judgment. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 1.6 million and 11.2 million, respectively, compared to a provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 2.1 million and 8.2 million, respectively, were due to charge-offs and additional reserve calculated in our normal reserve process for the Consumer Program portfolio. Excluding the provision amounts related to the Consumer Program, we would have recorded a recovery for credit losses of 0.5 million and a provision of 3.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We had charge-offs totaling 4.5 million and 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 10.7 million and 1.3 million during nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the charge-offs included 2.2 million and 5.7 million, respectively, related to the Consumer Program and a majority of the remaining were related to the partial resolution of the assisted living relationship that had been reserved for in prior quarters. There were recoveries totaling 0.2 million and 10 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 0.8 million during both nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The Financial Condition section of this MD A provides information on our loan portfolio, past due loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for credit losses. Noninterest Income The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: 

For the Three Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Account maintenance and deposit service fees 1,534 1,525 9 Income from bank-owned life insurance 787 394 393 Mortgage banking income 4,922 2,197 2,725 Gain on sale of loans 217 217 Consumer Program derivative 2,033 (871) 2,904 Other noninterest income 231 283 (52) Total noninterest income 9,724 3,528 6,196 Noninterest income increased 176 to 9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in noninterest income was primarily related to 2.9 million of higher Consumer Program derivative income and 2.7 million of higher mortgage banking income. The Consumer Program derivative was comprised of 9 thousand in fair value adjustment gains and 2.0 million of income related to waived interest and credit loss reimbursements from the derivative counterparty under the Consumer Program agreement. In comparison, during the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Consumer Program derivative losses were driven by 0.9 million of fair value loss adjustments as a result of a smaller portion of the loan portfolio being 0 promotional interest loans compared to the current year combined with less credit losses in the prior year which results in expected payments by us to the derivative counterparty. We purchased Primis Mortgage on May 31, 2022, and during the third quarter of 2022 it was continuing to grow its staffing levels and operations and by comparison by the third quarter of 2023 it had thirteen months growth behind it and therefore materially more loan origination and sales volume driving the income during the third quarter of 2023.

 The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Account maintenance and deposit service fees 4,215 4,318 (103) Income from bank-owned life insurance 1,601 1,147 454 Mortgage banking income 14,435 2,790 11,645 Gain on sale of loans 268 268 Consumer Program derivative 15,233 (1,055) 16,288 Other noninterest income 578 864 (286) Total noninterest income 36,330 8,064 28,266 Noninterest income increased 351 to 36.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in noninterest income was primarily related to 16.3 million in higher Consumer Program derivative income and 11.6 million of higher mortgage banking income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the mortgage banking income is related to the purchase of Primis Mortgage in May 2022, resulting in only four months of operations in the results of last year compared to a full nine months in 2023, coupled with meaningful growth in the business in the year since the purchase. Mortgage banking income includes fair value adjustments, origination income, and gains on sales of mortgage loans held for sale. The increase in the Consumer Program derivative was driven by 11.1 million in fair value adjustment gains on the derivative asset and 4.1 million of income related to waived interest and credit loss reimbursements from the derivative counterparty under the Consumer Program agreement. The fair value adjustment gains on the Consumer Program derivative was driven by substantial growth of the promotional interest portion of the Consumer Program loan portfolio coupled with the increased credit losses on the overall portfolio. Noninterest Expense The following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: 

For the Three Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Salaries and benefits 13,809 12,594 1,215 Occupancy expenses 1,633 1,402 231 Furniture and equipment expenses 1,537 1,455 82 Amortization of core deposit intangible 317 326 (9) Virginia franchise tax expense 849 813 36 FDIC insurance assessment 820 199 621 Data processing expense 2,250 1,528 722 Marketing expense 377 938 (561) Telephone and communication expense 356 342 14 Professional fees 1,118 1,261 (143) Miscellaneous lending expenses 424 701 (277) Fraud losses 267 263 4 Goodwill impairment 11,150 11,150 Other operating expenses 2,041 2,063 (22) Total noninterest expenses 36,948 23,885 13,063 Noninterest expenses were 36.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 23.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022. The 55 increase in noninterest expenses was primarily related to 11.2 million of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of 2023. Increase in noninterest expense was also

Table of Contents 
 driven by a 1.2 million increase in employee compensation in the third quarter of 2023 related to increased head count at the Bank, Primis Mortgage, and Panacea compared to the third quarter of 2022, along with personnel costs incurred related to the cost savings initiative announced at the end of the second quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was also attributable to a 0.7 million increase in data processing expense driven by substantially higher application volume on the digital deposit platform as a result of a savings account rate promotion offered during 2023 and 0.7 million higher FDIC insurance costs due to the significant growth in deposits partially offset by a decline in marketing expense. The following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Salaries and benefits 44,120 32,792 11,328 Occupancy expenses 4,671 4,277 394 Furniture and equipment expenses 4,966 3,683 1,283 Amortization of core deposit intangible 952 1,008 (56) Virginia franchise tax expense 2,546 2,440 106 FDIC insurance assessment 2,254 658 1,596 Data processing expense 7,329 4,311 3,018 Marketing expense 1,467 2,134 (667) Telephone and communication expense 1,149 1,090 59 Professional fees 3,055 3,182 (127) Miscellaneous lending expenses 1,878 1,074 804 Fraud losses 2,719 373 2,346 Goodwill impairment 11,150 11,150 Other operating expenses 6,085 6,438 (353) Total noninterest expenses 94,341 63,460 30,881 Noninterest expenses were 94.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 63.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The 49 increase in noninterest expenses was primarily attributable to a 11.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2023 and a 11.3 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expense mainly related to increased head count at the Bank, Primis Mortgage and Panacea in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 2022 and also due to expenses associated with the branch consolidation announced in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was also driven by a 3.0 million increase in data processing expense in 2023 driven by substantially higher application volume on the digital deposit platform as a result of a savings account rate promotion offered during 2023. The growth in deposits during the year, driven by the digital platform growth, also drove higher FDIC insurance costs of 1.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Furniture and equipment expenses increased 1.3 million due to growth in the Bank, Primis Mortgage, and Panacea, and also due to write-downs of assets related to the cost savings initiative announced in the second quarter of 2023. We also experienced an increase of 2.3 million in fraud losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to a substantial increase in deposit account fraud in the second quarter of 2023, which was also seen across the industry during that time. Miscellaneous lending expenses increased from prior year primarily driven by higher servicing costs paid to the Consumer Program counterparty that services the originated loans under the agreement, which increased significantly year-over-year.

 Consumer Program Loans The Company has 186.8 million and 134.4 million of loans outstanding in the Consumer Program as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, or 6 and 5 of our total gross loan portfolio as of each date. Loans in the Consumer Program are included within the Consumer loans category disclosures. As of September 30, 2023, 44 of the loans were in a promotional period requiring no payment of interest on their loans with 47 of these promotional loan periods ending in the next 12 months and the remaining ending within 24 months of September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, 44 of the loans were in a promotional period requiring no payment of interest on their loans with 21 and 79 of these promotional loan periods ending in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

 The following table describes the period over which our Consumer Program loans that are currently in a no interest promotional period will exit that promotional period and begin to amortize. All of these promotional loans amortize over four years from the date they exit the promotional period if not prepaid before the end of the promotional period (in thousands): 

Amount ending Amount ending No Interest No Interest Total Interest Promo Period in Promo Period in Promo next 12 months next 13-24 months as of 9/30/23 Consumer Program Loans 38,067 43,439 81,506 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 3.7 million and 5.9 million of promotional loans paid off prior to the end of their promotional periods while 1.8 million and 3.0 million of promotional loans reached the end of the promotional period and entered amortization. Asset Quality While the financial impact of COVID-19 largely subsided in 2023, the residual effect of COVID-19 and its variants, as well as new risks emerging from geopolitical conflict, inflation, bank failures and the threat of a recession continue to cause economic instability. Despite this economic uncertainty, our asset quality remained strong during 2023 and improved from December 31, 2022. We will generally place a loan on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash payments received while a loan is categorized as nonaccrual will be recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to future collections. We maintain appraisals on loans secured by real estate, particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans. In instances where appraisals reflect reduced collateral values, we make an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for impairment or write-down to their fair values. If foreclosure occurs, we record OREO at the lower of our recorded investment in the loan or fair value less our estimated costs to sell. Our loan portfolio losses and delinquencies have been primarily limited by our underwriting standards and portfolio management practices. Whether losses and delinquencies in our portfolio will increase significantly depends upon the value of the real estate securing the loans and economic factors, such as the overall economy in our market area, rising interest rates, historically high inflation, and recessionary concerns. Total calculated reserves increased by 1.4 million to 35.9 million at the end of September 30, 2023 compared to 34.5 million at December 31, 2022, driven by growth in the Consumer Program loan portfolio and secondarily due to the 231.7 million in overall loan growth experienced in 2023.

 The following table presents a comparison of nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands): 

September 30, December 31, 2023 2022 Nonaccrual loans 20,171 35,484 Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest 1,714 3,361 Total nonperforming assets 21,885 38,845 SBA guaranteed amounts included in nonperforming loans 2,290 3,969 Allowance for credit losses to total loans 1.13 1.17 Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 177.79 97.35 Allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 163.87 88.93 Nonaccrual to total loans 0.63 1.20 Nonperforming assets excluding SBA guaranteed loans to total assets 0.51 0.98 Nonaccrual loans decreased 43 to 20.2 million (excluding 0.6 million of loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) as of September 30, 2023, compared to 35.5 million (excluding 0.6 million of loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) as of December 31, 2022. Included in the Bank s nonperforming assets is one remaining assisted living problem credit outstanding as of September 30, 2023 related to the relationship discussed in previous quarters and with a book balance of 13.1 million. This credit was resolved in early October 2023, bringing pro forma nonperforming assets to 6.5 million as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, our total substandard loans were 28.8 million, compared to 41.0 million at December 31, 2022, a 30 decline. Included in the total substandard loans were SBA guarantees of 0.8 million in both periods. Special mention loans totaled 33.3 million as of September 30, 2023 and 32.3 million as of December 31, 2022. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, on an amortized cost basis, three other consumer loans totaling 0.3 million were modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This represents 0.10 of the other consumer loan portfolio. Two of the loans, totaling 0.2 million in amortized cost, were to one borrower and received payment deferrals for three months, with principal and interest payments resuming August 2023. Total contractual payments for these loans for the quarter, prior to modification, would have been approximately 11 thousand. Both loans are current on principal and interest following the deferral period. The third other consumer loan modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, had an amortized cost of 0.1 million and the Company reduced monthly payments on the loan for the remaining 84-month term with no change to the original rate or maturity. The contractual payments for the quarter would have totaled approximately 9 thousand if the modification had not been provided. The loan is paying as agreed following the modification. An existing modification of a 1-4 family residential loan in the first quarter of 2023, with an amortized cost of 0.9 million, resumed contractual payments in August following its payment deferral period and has experienced no payment delinquencies since the deferral period ended. This modification is 0.14 of the 1-4 family residential loan portfolio. Two loans modified in the second quarter of 2023 from our owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio with an amortized cost balance of 0.4 million are paying as agreed following the modifications. These loans represent 0.10 of the owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio. Investment Securities Our investment securities portfolio provides us with required liquidity and collateral to pledge secure public deposits, certain other deposits, advances from the FHLB of Atlanta, and repurchase agreements.

Table of Contents 
 We classify our investment securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Debt investment securities that Primis has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are those debt securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or other similar factors. Investment securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses net of deferred taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Our portfolio of available-for-sale securities currently contains a material amount of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments due to increases in market interest rates since the original purchase of many of these securities. We have the intention to hold these securities until maturity or recovery of the value and do not anticipate realizing any losses on the investments. Investment securities, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled 228.9 million as of September 30, 2023, a decrease of 8 from 249.8 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily due to paydowns, maturities, and calls of the investments over the past nine months. The following table sets forth a summary of the investment securities portfolio as of the dates indicated. Available-for-sale investment securities are reported at fair value, and held-to-maturity investment securities are reported at amortized cost (in thousands). 

September 30, December 31, 2023 2022 Available-for-sale investment securities: Residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 93,865 102,881 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 28,312 29,178 Corporate securities 13,314 14,828 Collateralized loan obligations 4,955 4,876 Residential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations 29,745 26,595 Government-sponsored agency securities 12,968 14,616 Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 29,280 37,417 SBA pool securities 4,436 5,924 Total 216,875 236,315 Held-to-maturity investment securities: Residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 9,357 10,522 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 2,390 2,721 Residential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations 228 277 Total 11,975 13,520 We recognized an immaterial amount of credit impairment charges related to credit losses on our held-to-maturity investment securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and no credit losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Deposits and Other Borrowings Deposits The market for deposits is competitive. We offer a line of traditional deposit products that currently include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking (or NOW accounts), commercial checking, money market accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. We compete for deposits through our banking branches with competitive pricing, as well as nationally through advertising and online banking. We use deposits as a principal source of funding for our lending, purchasing of investment securities and for other business purposes. Total deposits increased 21 to 3.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 from 2.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase in deposits from year-end was primarily driven by the substantial growth in the Bank s digital deposit platform in 2023. The majority of the overall deposit growth was in savings accounts with the remainder largely in NOW accounts 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 (both largely coming from the digital platform). Savings accounts increased 204 from 245.8 million as of December 31, 2022 to 746.6 million as of September 30, 2023. NOW accounts increased 30 from 617.7 million as of December 31, 2022 to 803.3 million as of September 30, 2023. Our deposits are diversified in type and by underlying customer and lack significant concentrations to any type of customer (i.e. commercial, consumer, government) or industry. Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured deposits as calculated per regulatory guidance were 1.11 billion, or 34 of total deposits, at September 30, 2023. Liquidity sources represent almost 185 of uninsured or unsecured deposits, up substantially from December 31, 2022. The variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and in responding to the threat of disintermediation (the flow of funds away from depository institutions such as banking institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities). Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, and the effect of such retention on our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by the general economy and market rates of interest. For our deposit agreements with certain customers, we hold the collateral in a segregated custodial account. We are required to maintain adequate collateral levels. In the event the collateral fair value falls below stipulated levels, we will pledge additional securities. We closely monitor collateral levels to ensure adequate levels are maintained, while mitigating the potential risk of over-collateralization. Other Borrowings We use other borrowed funds to support our liquidity needs and to temporarily satisfy our funding needs from increased loan demand and for other shorter term purposes. We are a member of the FHLB and are authorized to obtain advances from the FHLB from time to time as needed. The FHLB has a credit program for members with different maturities and interest rates, which may be fixed or variable. We are required to collateralize our borrowings from the FHLB with purchases of FHLB stock and other collateral acceptable to the FHLB. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, total FHLB borrowings were 0 and 325.0 million, respectively. The decrease in FHLB borrowings was a result of the deposit growth during the first quarter of 2023 that primarily funded our loan growth and supported other funding needs and allowing us to repay our FHLB advances. As of September 30, 2023, we had 558.9 million of unused and available FHLB lines of credit. Other borrowings can consist of federal funds purchased, secured borrowings due to failed loan sales, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo that mature within one year, which are secured transactions with customers. The balance in repo accounts was 3.8 million and 6.4 million at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We had secured borrowings of 29.6 million as of September 30, 2023 related to loan transfers to other financial institutions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 that did not meet the criteria to be treated as a sale under relevant accounting guidance. These borrowings reflect the cash received for transferring the loans to the other financial institutions and any unamortized sale premium and are secured by approximately the same amount of loans held for investment that are recorded in our balance sheet. We retained the servicing of the loans that were transferred and accordingly receive principal and interest from the borrower as contractually required and transfer the interest to the other financial institutions net of our contractually agreed upon servicing fee. The loans transferred have an average maturity of approximately ten years which will be the time over which the principal balance of the loans in our balance sheet and secured borrowings will pay down, absent borrower prepayments. For additional information on secured borrowings refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q/A. Liquidity and Funds Management The objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the ability to meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at maturity, the repayment of borrowings at maturity and the ability to fund

 commitments and other new business opportunities. We obtain funding from a variety of sources, including customer deposit accounts, customer certificates of deposit and payments on our loans and investments. If our level of core deposits are not sufficient to fully fund our lending activities, we have access to funding from additional sources, including but not limited to borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and institutional certificates of deposits. In addition, we maintain federal funds lines of credit with two correspondent banks, totaling 75 million, and utilize securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo and reverse repurchase agreement borrowings from approved securities dealers, as needed. We prepare a cash flow forecast on a 30, 60 and 90 day basis along with a one and two year basis. These projections incorporate expected cash flows on loans, investment securities, and deposits based on data used to prepare our interest rate risk analyses. As of September 30, 2023, we had substantial liquidity on the balance sheet with cash and equivalents of 93.9 million versus 77.9 million as of December 31, 2022 largely due to the growth in digital platform deposits described above. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had pledged callable agency securities, residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with a carrying value of 6.4 million and 14.2 million, respectively, to customers who require collateral for overnight repurchase agreements and deposits. The balance in repo accounts as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 3.8 million and 6.4 million, respectively. We repaid our short-term FHLB advances of 325.0 million that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and matured in the first quarter of 2023. As a result, we have all of our FHLB capacity available for future liquidity needs. As of September 30, 2023, Primis Bank had lendable collateral value in the form of residential 1-4 family mortgages, HELOCs, commercial mortgage loans, and investment securities supporting borrowing capacity of approximately 558.9 million from the FHLB. In June 2023, the Bank began participating in the Federal Reserve discount window borrowing program. As of September 30, 2023, the Bank had borrowing capacity of 548.9 million within the program. Since we began participating we have not utilized any of our available capacity. In March 2023, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program BTFP in response to recent industry disruption, offering loans with up to one year in maturity to eligible depository institutions in exchange for pledged collateral in the form of U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other qualifying assets. Borrowing capacity under the BTFP is based on the par value, not fair value, of the collateral. As of September 30, 2023, we had securities available of 133.8 million for utilization with the BTFP, with no borrowings outstanding under the program as of September 30, 2023. The Bank also utilizes institutional and brokered certificates of deposit to supplement customer funding. As of September 30, 2023, we had 75.0 million of brokered deposits outstanding, which are schedule to mature in the fourth quarter of 2023. We had remaining brokered CD capacity under internal policy of approximately 321.0 million. As of September 30, 2023, we had 467.3 million of unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds, not all of which will ultimately be drawn. The amount of certificate of deposit accounts maturing in less than one year was 394.7 million as of September 30, 2023, including 75.0 million of brokered CDs as discussed above. Management anticipates that funding requirements for these commitments can be met in the normal course of our operations. As of September 30, 2023, Primis was not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of September 30, 2023, Primis has no material commitments for capital expenditures.

 Stockholder s equity Stockholder s equity balances decreased 11.4 million from December 31, 2022 to September 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on the Company s available-for-sale securities portfolio due to increases in market interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and dividends on common stock exceeding earnings in the period, primarily as a result of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company has the intent and ability to hold the available-for-sale securities that are currently in an unrealized loss position until maturity or recovery of the value and does not anticipate realizing any losses on the investments. Capital Resources Capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations. Primis Financial Corp. and its subsidiary, Primis Bank, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action PCA ), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under regulatory framework for PCA. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Primis to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of September 30, 2023, that Primis meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. The following table provides a comparison of the leverage and risk-weighted capital ratios of Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank at the periods indicated to the minimum and well-capitalized required regulatory standards. These ratios were not impacted by the goodwill impairment charge incurred during the period because goodwill is not a component of the calculations:

 (1) Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable at the bank holding company level. 
 Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank are required to meet minimum capital requirements set forth by regulatory authorities. Bank regulatory agencies have approved regulatory capital guidelines Basel III aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules require Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , plus a 2.5 capital conservation buffer , (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 , 

 59

 plus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. Primis Bank had a capital conservation buffer of 4.91 as of September 30, 2023, which exceeded the 2.50 minimum requirement below which the regulators may impose limits on distributions. Primis Bank s capital position is consistent with being well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for PCA. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Restated) The critical accounting policies are discussed in MD A in our restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in the Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022. Disclosures regarding changes in our significant accounting policies since year end and the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in Note 1 - Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q/A. As required under U.S. GAAP, we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if there are indications that goodwill could be impaired. Our annual goodwill impairment testing date is September 30 and accordingly, we performed testing as of September 30, 2023 of our two reporting units that include goodwill. For our assessment of goodwill as of September 30, 2023, we performed a step one quantitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the Primis Bank reporting unit and the Primis Mortgage reporting units were less than their carrying amount. As part of the testing, we engaged an independent valuation firm to quantitatively estimate the fair value of each reporting unit so that it could be compared to the carrying value in assisting us in determining if impairment existed. The results of the quantitative assessment of the Primis Mortgage reporting unit indicated that its fair value was in excess of its carrying value, thus no goodwill impairment was necessary. Our assessment of the Primis Bank reporting unit included the use of three approaches, each receiving various weightings to determine an ultimate fair value estimate: (1) the comparable transactions method that is based on comparison to pricing ratios recently paid in the sale or merger of comparable banking institutions; (2) the public market peers control premium approach that is based on market pricing ratios of public banking companies adjusted for an industry based control premium, and (3) a discounted cash flow method (an income method), taking into consideration expectations of the Company s growth and profitability going forward. The assessment included use of various assumptions and inputs into the modeling approaches, including creating a baseline and conservative scenarios that stressed certain assumptions such as projected cash flows and the discount rate. We considered the modeled results of each scenario and in light of the sustained depressed stock price during the third quarter compared to our book value we determined it was reasonable to leverage the results of a scenario that utilized more stressed inputs and assumptions. Ultimately, the result of the quantitative assessment indicated the Primis Bank reporting unit s book value was more than its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we took an impairment charge to Primis Bank s goodwill of 11.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing as of September 30, 2023 will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Changes in assumptions, market data (for market-based assessments), or the discount rate (for income based assessments) could produce different results that lead to higher or lower fair value determinations compared to the results of our annual impairment testing performed as of September 30, 2023. Further, because the use of inputs and assumptions are highly judgmental an analysis performed to assess the fair value of our reporting units by others may results in higher, lower, or the same fair value determination and goodwill impairment decision through the use of their judgment in application of similar inputs and assumptions as we used.

 ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Revised and Restated) We are engaged primarily in the business of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings into interest-earning loans and investments. Consequently, our earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income on loans and other investments and the interest expense on deposits and borrowings. To the extent that our interest-bearing liabilities do not reprice or mature at the same time as our interest-earning assets, we are subject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations in net interest income. Our Asset-Liability Committee ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by the ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors. We have employed asset/liability management policies that seek to manage our net interest income, without having to incur unacceptable levels of credit or investment risk. We use simulation modeling to manage our interest rate risk, and review quarterly interest sensitivity. This approach uses a model which generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity EVE over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts using assumptions including estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates. The following tables are based on an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in EVE resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (plus 400 basis points or minus 100 basis points, measured in 100 basis point increments) as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. All changes are within our Asset/Liability Risk Management Policy guidelines.

NII depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. In this regard, the 

 61 

Table of Contents 
 model assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. All changes are within our ALM Policy guidelines as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income As of September 30, 2023 Adjusted Net Interest Income Change in Interest Rates Change in Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base (dollar amounts in thousands) Up 400 104,691 (14,577) Up 300 107,573 (11,695) Up 200 110,454 (8,814) Up 100 115,369 (3,899) Base 119,268 Down 100 121,676 2,408 Down 200 122,186 2,918 

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income As of December 31, 2022 Adjusted Net Interest Income Change in Interest Rates Change in Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base (dollar amounts in thousands) Up 400 108,514 (12,447) Up 300 111,127 (9,834) Up 200 113,730 (7,231) Up 100 117,811 (3,150) Base 120,961 Down 100 122,070 1,109 Down 200 120,687 (274) Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE and NII sensitivity requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE tables and NII tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net worth and NII. Sensitivity of EVE and NII are modeled using different assumptions and approaches. ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (Restated) (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) utilizing the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. This conclusion was reached as a 

 62 

Table of Contents 
 result of the continued remediation of previously identified material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting as further described in Item 9A in the restated 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A related to complex accounting arrangements and also due to the identification of an additional material weakness related to the transfer of certain loans to another financial institution during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Management identified the additional material weakness over the Company s internal controls over financial reporting for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to accounting determinations for transfers of financial assets including lack of a formally designed process and procedure for evaluation of loan transfers. The existing procedures did not outline the process to be taken and individuals to be involved in assessment of the proper accounting for loan transfers and were not sufficient enough to facilitate a proper conclusion on loan transfer transactions. As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Amendment. The Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2023, at the reasonable assurance level, because of the material weakness in internal controls, which were disclosed in the Company's restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022 (with respect to the Consumer Program) and Current Report on Form 8-K on March 1, 2024 (with respect to the loan transfers). Notwithstanding the material weakness, the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in the Form 10-Q/A, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash-flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Remediation Plans (i) Complex accounting arrangements 
 Management continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including implementing additional internal controls over the identification of complex agreements the Company enters into and ensuring the appropriate level of review of these agreements by an individual with the requisite accounting expertise. The Company is adding additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting to require appropriate levels of accounting management review of new transactions. Additionally, the Company will seek appropriate third-party accounting expertise when it determines a transaction contains complex arrangements that management does not have sufficient expertise to assess and conclude upon. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. The Company has made progress in the remediation efforts related to the material weakness and anticipates the control weakness to be remediated as soon as possible. (ii) Loan transfers Management continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including implementing additional internal controls over the identification of loan transfer transactions and management review of the transactions. The Company has added additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. The Company has made progress in the remediation efforts related to the material weakness and anticipates the control weakness to be remediated as soon as possible. The Company s remediation efforts include: created a specific control in its quarterly financial close process to facilitate the identification of loan transfers and trigger an accounting review; created a process to assess loan transfers in accordance with applicable accounting guidance; 

 63 

Table of Contents 
 established procedures to enable the accounting assessment in accordance with U.S. GAAP; and developed criteria that facilitates the decision process for use of outside legal counsel to assist in evaluating the legal isolation requirement. 
 The Company s actions are subject to ongoing executive management review and are also subject to audit committee oversight. If the Company is unable to successfully remediate the material weakness, or if in the future, the Company identifies further material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not detect errors on a timely basis, and its condensed consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. Management may determine that additional measures are required to address control deficiencies, strengthen internal control over financial reporting, or it may determine to modify the remediation measures described above. (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . As a result of the acquisition of Primis Mortgage, the Company is continuously working to integrate Primis Mortgage into its internal control over financial reporting process. Except for the changes in connection with this integration of Primis Mortgage and the material weaknesses noted above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Primis and Primis Bank are from time to time a party, as both plaintiff and defendant, to various claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of the Bank s business, including administrative and/or legal proceedings that may include employment-related claims, as well as claims of lender liability, breach of contract, and other similar lending-related claims. While the ultimate resolution of these matters cannot be determined at this time, the Bank s management presently believes that such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. There are no proceedings pending, or to management s knowledge, threatened, that represent a significant risk against Primis or Primis Bank as of September 30, 2023. ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS (Restated) There were no changes to the risk factors that were previously disclosed in our restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for the addition of the item below. Recent negative developments in the banking industry could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. The recent bank failures and related negative media attention have generated significant market trading volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies and, in particular, regional, as well as community banks like the Company. These developments have negatively impacted customer confidence in regional and community banks, which could prompt customers to maintain their deposits with larger financial institutions. Further, competition for deposits has increased in recent periods, and the cost of funding has similarly increased, putting pressure on our net interest margin. If we were required to sell a portion of our securities portfolio to address liquidity needs, we may incur losses, including as a result of the negative impact of rising interest rates on the value of our securities portfolio, which could negatively affect our earnings and our capital. If we were required to raise additional capital in the current environment, any such capital raise may be on unfavorable terms, thereby negatively impacting book value and profitability. While we have taken actions to improve our funding, there is no guarantee that such actions will be successful or sufficient in the event of sudden liquidity needs. We also anticipate increased regulatory scrutiny in the course of routine examinations and otherwise and new regulations directed towards banks of similar size to Primis Bank, designed to address the recent negative developments 

 64 

Table of Contents 
 in the banking industry, all of which may increase our costs of doing business and reduce our profitability. Among other things, there may be an increased focus by both regulators and investors on deposit composition, the level of uninsured deposits, losses embedded in the held-to-maturity portion of our securities portfolio, contingent liquidity, CRE composition and concentration, capital position and our general oversight and internal control structures regarding the foregoing. As a result, Primis Bank could face increased scrutiny or be viewed as higher risk by regulators and the investor community.
