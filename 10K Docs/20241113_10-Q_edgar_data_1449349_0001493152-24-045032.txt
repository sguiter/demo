Our
principal place of business is located at 1030 North Center Parkway, Kennewick, WA 99336. Our telephone number is (509) 222-2222. Our
corporate website address is http://www.radiogel.com. Our Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbol
 RDGL. 

The
Company is a radiation oncology medical device company engaged in the development of its yttrium-90 based brachytherapy device, RadioGel ,
for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. A prominent team of radiochemists, scientists and engineers, collaborating with strategic
partners, including national laboratories, universities and private corporations, lead the Company s development efforts. The Company s
overall vision is to globally empower physicians, medical researchers, and patients by providing them with new isotope technologies that
offer safe and effective treatments for cancer. 

In
January 2018, the Center for Veterinary Medicine Product Classification Group ruled that RadioGel should be classified
as a device for animal therapy of feline sarcomas and canine soft tissue sarcomas. Additionally, after a legal review, the Company believes
that the device classification obtained from the Food and Drug Administration FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine
is not limited to canine and feline sarcomas, but rather may be extended to a much broader population of veterinary cancers, including
all or most solid tumors in animals. We expect the result of such classification and label review will be that no additional regulatory
approvals are necessary for the use of IsoPet for the treatment of solid tumors in animals. The FDA does not have premarket
authority over devices with a veterinary classification, and the manufacturers are responsible for assuring that the product is safe,
effective, properly labeled, and otherwise in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

Based
on the FDA s recommendation, RadioGel will be marketed as IsoPet for use by veterinarians
to avoid any confusion between animal and human therapy. The Company already has trademark protection for the IsoPet 
name. IsoPet and RadioGel are used synonymously throughout this document. The only distinction between
IsoPet and RadioGel is the FDA s recommendation that we use IsoPet 
for veterinarian usage, and reserve RadioGel for human therapy. Based on these developments, the Company
has shifted its primary focus to the development and marketing of Isopet for animal therapy, through the Company s
IsoPet Solutions division. 

The
dogs were treated for canine soft tissue sarcoma. Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors RECIST is a set
of published rules that define when tumors in cancer patients improve (respond), stay the same (stabilize), or worsen (progress) during
treatment. The criteria were published by an international collaboration including the European Organisation for Research and Treatment
of Cancer EORTC ), National Cancer Institute of the United States, and the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical
Trials Group. 

The
testing at the University of Missouri met its objective to demonstrate the safety of IsoPet . Using its advanced CT and
PET equipment it was able to demonstrate that the dose calculations were accurate and that the injections perfused into the cell interstices
and did not stay concentrated in a bolus. This results in a more homogeneous dose distribution. There was insignificant spread of Y-90
outside the points of injection demonstrating the effectiveness of the particles and the gel to localize the radiation with no spreading
to the blood or other organs nor to urine or fecal material. This confirms that IsoPet is safe for same day therapy. 

The
effectiveness of IsoPet for life extension was not the prime objective, but it resulted in valuable insights. Of the
cases one is still cancer-free but the others eventually recurred since there was not a strong focus on treating the margins. The University
of Missouri has agreed to become a regional center to administer IsoPet therapy and will incorporate the improvements
suggested by the testing program. 

The
Company anticipates that future profits, if any, will be derived from direct sales of RadioGel (under the name IsoPet and related services, and from licensing to private medical and veterinary clinics in the United States of America (the USA ,
or, the U.S. and internationally. The Company intends to report the results from the IsoPet Solutions
division as a separate operating segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). 

Commencing
in July 2019, the Company recognized its first commercial sale of IsoPet . A veterinarian from Alaska brought his cat
with a re-occurrent spindle cell sarcoma tumor on his face. The cat had previously received external beam therapy, but now the tumor
was growing rapidly. He was given a high dose of 400 Gray with heavy therapy at the margins. This sale met the revenue recognition requirements
under Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic
606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 as the performance obligation was satisfied. The Company
completed sales for an additional four animals that received the IsoPet during 2019. 

Our
plan is to incorporate the data assembled from our work with Isopet in animal therapy to support the Company s
efforts in the development of our RadioGel device candidate, including obtaining approval from the FDA to market and
sell RadioGel as a Class II medical device. RadioGel is an injectable particle-gel for brachytherapy
radiation treatment of cancerous tumors in people and animals. RadioGel is comprised of a hydrogel, or a substance
that is liquid at room temperature and then gels when reaching body temperature after injection into a tumor. In the gel are small particles,
less than two microns, of Y-90. Once injected, these inert particles are locked in place inside the tumor by the gel, delivering a very
high local radiation dose. The radiation is beta, consisting of high-speed electrons. These electrons only travel a short distance so
the device can deliver high radiation to the tumor with minimal dose to the surrounding tissue. Optimally, patients can go home immediately
following treatment without the risk of radiation exposure to family members. Since Y-90 has a half-life of 2.7 days, the radioactivity
drops to 5 of its original value after ten days. 

The
Company modified its Indication for Use from skin cancel to cancerous tissue or solid tumors pathologically associated with locoregional
papillary thyroid carcinoma and recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma having discernable tumors associated with metastatic lymph nodes
or extranodal disease in patients who are not surgical candidates or who have declined surgery, or patients who require post-surgical
remnant ablation (for example, after prior incomplete radioiodine therapy). Papillary thyroid carcinoma belongs to the general class
of head and neck tumors for which tumors are accessible by intraoperative direct needle injection. The Company s Medical Advisory
Board felt that demonstrating efficacy in clinical trials was much easier with this new indication. 

In
the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered the market of treating exotic animals by treating a ferret. The Company also has established
important contacts at zoos and used conferences to communicate the effectiveness of Precision Radionuclide Therapy TM to the
zoo community. 

The
Company intends to conduct human trials internationally, initially in Southeast Asia. These trials will be initiated prior to trials
in the United States, and will be conducted under a protocol consistent with and complimentary to the IDE and human trial roadmap in
the United States. 

Our
RadioGel trademark protection is in 17 countries. We have expanded our trademark protection from RadioGel 
 to now include IsoPet . We obtained the International Certificate of Registration for ISOPET, which is the first
step to file in several countries . 

We
have filed for trademark protection for the term Precision Radionuclide Therapy . We believe this term will be increasingly
important. 

The
Company received the Patent Cooperation Treaty PCT International Search Report on our patent application (No.1811.191).
Seven of our claims were immediately ruled as having novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. This gives us the basis to
extend for many years the patent protection for our proprietary Y-90 phosphate particles utilized in Isopet and Radiogel . 

Our
patent team filed our particle patent in more than ten patent offices that collectively cover 63 countries throughout the world. We filed
a continuation-in-part applications number 1774054 in the USA to expand the claims on our particle patent. The U.S. Patent office recently
gave us the Notice of Allowance for our patent to produce our yttrium phosphate microparticles, U.S. Patent Application Serial No: 16-459,466.
We also filed an amendment to correct the wording on our claims at make them consistent with the USE claims. Ref: 4207-0005; European
Patent Application NO. 20 834 229.5; VIVOS INC; Our Ref: FS/53791. 

We
filed a hydrogel utility patent in the USA (16309:17/943,311) and internationally (16389:PCT/US22/4374) based on the last 18 months of
development work to optimize our hydrogel component. These include reducing the polymer production time and increasing the output by
a factor of three. We have also further reduced the level of trace contaminants to be well below the FDA guidelines. 

We
filed a provisional patent (Serial Number 63436562) to protect our innovative improvements in our shipping container, our vial shield,
our syringe shield, and our Peltier chiller. Our objectives were to reduce shipping costs, decrease radiation exposure, and enhance sterility.
These devices will be preferentially used at Mayo Clinics for human clinical studies at our IsoPet regional treatment centers. The Company
filed a utility patent in the fourth quarter of 2023 for this therapy support equipment. 

We
anticipate that Precision Radionuclide Therapy will become increasingly important in the future and expand to other isotope and other
indications for use. Therefore, we filed an alternate particle utility patent (Serial number 18/152,137). We will focus our near-term
effort on the Y-90 therapy, which we believe is the best beta emitter; however, we leveraged our hydrogel utility patent to incorporate
other promising isotopes and compounds for a range of future applications. This includes gamma and alpha particle emitters. 

We
have trademark protection in several countries on IsoPet , RadioGel , Precision Radionuclide Therapy TM ,
BetaGel TM , GammaGel TM , and AlphaGel TM . 

million
annually to maintain current operating activities. 

was raised
through the sale of shares of common stock and the private placement of warrants. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company raised through the issuance of shares of common stock and warrants. The
Company s Prior Regulation A Offerings undertaken pursuant to Regulation A+ have raised approximately from the sale
of shares of common stock. 

On
July 17, 2024, the SEC qualified the Company s offering under Regulation A to offer up to shares of its Common Stock
(the July 2024 Regulation A+ Offering ). 

The
Company is using the proceeds generated from the Prior Regulation A+ Offering and the July 2024 Regulation A+ Offering as follows: 

Research
and development of the Company s brachytherapy product line has been funded with proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities.
The Company may require additional funding of approximately 
 million annually to maintain current operating
activities. 

The
continued deployment of the brachytherapy products and a worldwide regulatory approval effort will require additional resources and personnel.
The principal variables in the timing and amount of spending for the brachytherapy products in the next 12 to 24 months will be the FDA s
classification of the Company s brachytherapy products as Class II or Class III devices (or otherwise), and any requirements for
additional studies (which may possibly include clinical studies). Thereafter, the principal variables in the amount of the Company s
spending and its financing requirements would be: (1) the timing of any approvals; (2) the nature of the Company s arrangements
with third parties for manufacturing, sales, distribution, and licensing of those products; and (3) the products success in the
U.S. and elsewhere. The Company intends to fund its activities through strategic transactions such as licensing and partnership agreements,
as well as proceeds to be raised from the Regulation A+ Offerings. 

Following
receipt of required regulatory approvals and necessary financing to fund our working capital requirements, the Company intends to outsource
material aspects of manufacturing, distribution, sales, and marketing for operations within the U.S. Outside of the U.S., the Company
intends to pursue licensing arrangements and/or partnerships to facilitate its global commercialization strategy. 

Long-term,
the Company intends to consider resuming research efforts with respect to other products and technologies intended to help improve the
diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other illnesses. These long-term goals are subject to the Company: (1) receiving adequate funding;
(2) receiving regulatory approval for RadioGel and other brachytherapy products; and (3) being able to successfully
commercialize its brachytherapy products. 

Based
on the Company s financial history since inception, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm has expressed
substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has limited revenue, nominal cash, and
has accumulated deficits since inception. If the Company cannot obtain sufficient additional capital, the Company will be required to
delay the implementation of its business strategy and may not be able to continue operations. 

The
Company s headquarters are in Northeast Washington, however, our focus on the animal therapy market has been the Northwestern sector
of the U.S. The Company continues its marketing efforts on the animal therapy market and our attempts to increase the exposure to our
product, and generate revenue accordingly. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash on hand. There are currently commitments to vendors for products and services
purchased. To continue the development of the Company s products, the current level of cash will not be enough to cover the fixed
and variable obligations of the Company. 

The
Company anticipates using the proceeds from the July 2024 Regulation A+ Offering as follows: 

For
the animal therapy market: 

Expand
 communication on our website, the Company s social media presence, conferences, and journals, each intended to increase the
 number of certified clinics for small animal and equine therapy and to increase the number of patients. 

Subsidize
 some IsoPet therapies, if necessary, to ensure that all viable candidates are treated; and. 

Assist
 a new regional clinic with their license and certification training. 

For
the human market: 

Enhance

Research
and development of the Company s precision radionuclide therapy product line has been funded with proceeds from the sale of equity
and debt securities, including from the Prior Regulation A+ Offerings. The Company requires additional funding of approximately 
 million annually to maintain operating activities.
 The
proceeds raised from the Prior Regulation A+ Offerings were used to fund this development and proceeds from the July 2024 Regulation
A+ Offering will be used to continue such development efforts. 

The
continued deployment of the precision radionuclide therapy products and a worldwide regulatory approval effort will require additional
resources and personnel. The principal variables in the timing and amount of spending for the precision radionuclide therapy products
in the next 12 to 24 months will be the FDA s classification of the Company s precision radionuclide therapy products as
Class II or Class III devices (or otherwise) and any requirements for additional studies which may possibly include clinical studies.
Thereafter, the principal variables in the amount of the Company s spending and its financing requirements would be the timing
of any approvals and the nature of the Company s arrangements with third parties for manufacturing, sales, distribution and licensing
of those products and the products success in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Company intends to fund its activities through strategic
transactions such as licensing and partnership agreements or from proceeds raised from the Prior Regulation A+ Offering and from the
July 2024 Regulation A+ Offering. 

The
Company intends to expand the indications for use in phases: first, for lymph nodes associated with thyroid cancer, secondly, cancerous
lung nodules, and finally, all non-sectable solid tumors. It is anticipated that the medical community may begin to use RadioGel off-label,
we will support but will not encourage that practice. 

Following
receipt of required regulatory approvals and financing, in the U.S., the Company intends to outsource material aspects of manufacturing,
distribution, sales and marketing. Outside of the U.S., the Company intends to pursue licensing arrangements and/or partnerships to facilitate
its global commercialization strategy. 

Long-term,
the Company intends to consider resuming research efforts with respect to other products and technologies, such as Gamma Gel and Alpha
Gel intended to help improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other illnesses. These long-term goals are subject to the Company:
(1) receiving adequate funding; (2) receiving regulatory approval for RadioGel and other precision radionuclide therapy
products; and (3) being able to successfully commercialize its precision radionuclide therapy products. 

Based
on the Company s financial history since inception, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm has expressed
substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has limited revenue, nominal cash, and
has accumulated deficits since inception. If the Company cannot obtain sufficient additional capital, the Company will be required to
delay the implementation of its business strategy and may not be able to continue operations. 

The
Company s headquarters are in the State of Washington., The initial focus of the animal therapy market has been the Northwestern
sector of the United States. The Company has initiated marketing efforts to the animal therapy market in other regions of the United
States, attempting to increase the exposure to our product and increase revenue opportunities. 

There
are currently commitments to vendors for products and services purchased. To continue the development of the Company s products,
the current level of cash will not be enough to cover the fixed and variable obligations of the Company. The Company has focused on operating
on minimum overhead, including using a virtual office for the last several years and retaining experienced industry consultants available
on an as needed basis. This has helped focus the capital received from the Company s Regulation A+ Offerings on activities that
enhance our objectives. 

There
is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or to do so on terms advantageous to the Company s stockholders. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its
ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. The Company
plans to seek additional funding to maintain its operations through debt and equity financing and to improve operating performance through
a focus on strategic products and increased efficiencies in business processes and improvements to the cost structure. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to raise additional working capital or achieve profitable operations. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

and the Company begins utilization of the patents through production and sales, resulting in revenues. 

The
Company evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets, including patents and intellectual property on a continual basis. Several
factors are used to evaluate intangibles, including, but not limited to, management s plans for future operations, recent operating
results and projected and expected undiscounted future cash flows. 

There
have been no such capitalized costs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. However, a patent was
filed on July 1, 2019 (No. 1811.191) filed by Michael Korenko and David Swanberg and assigned to the Company based on the Company s
proprietary particle manufacturing process. The timing of this filing was important given the Company s plans to make IsoPet 
 commercially available, which it did on or about July 9, 2019. This additional patent protection will strengthen the Company s
competitive position. It is the Company s intention to further extend this patent protection to several key countries within one
year, as permitted under international patent laws and treaties.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Except
for statements of historical fact, certain information described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements
by forward-looking words such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, 
 intend, may, should, will, would or similar words. The statements
that contain these or similar words should be read carefully because these statements discuss the Company s future expectations,
including its expectations of its future results of operations or financial position, or state other forward-looking information.
Vivos Inc. believes that it is important to communicate its future expectations to its investors. However, there may be events in the
future that the Company is not able to accurately predict or to control. Further, the Company urges you to be cautious of the forward-looking
statements which are contained in this Quarterly Report because they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors affecting its operations,
market growth, service, products and licenses. The risk factors in the section captioned Risk Factors in Item 1A of the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024, as well as other cautionary language in this Quarterly
Report, describe such risks, uncertainties and events that may cause the Company s actual results and achievements, whether expressed
or implied, to differ materially from the expectations the Company describes in its forward-looking statements. The occurrence of any
of the events described as risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and
financial position. 

Vivos
Inc. (the Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on December 23, 1994 as Savage Mountain Sports Corporation SMSC ). On September 6, 2006, the Company changed its name to Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation, and on December
28, 2017, the Company began operating as Vivos Inc. The Company has authorized capital of 950,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.001
par value per share Common Stock ), and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.001 par value per share Preferred
Stock ). 

Our
principal place of business is located at 1030 North Center Parkway, Kennewick, WA 99336. Our telephone number is (509) 222-2222. Our
corporate website address is http://www.radiogel.com. Our Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbol
 RDGL. 

The
Company is a radiation oncology medical device company engaged in the development of its yttrium-90 based brachytherapy device, RadioGel ,
for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. A prominent team of radiochemists, scientists and engineers, collaborating with strategic
partners, including national laboratories, universities and private corporations, lead the Company s development efforts. The Company s
overall vision is to globally empower physicians, medical researchers, and patients by providing them with new isotope technologies that
offer safe and effective treatments for cancer. 

In
January 2018, the Center for Veterinary Medicine Product Classification Group ruled that RadioGel should be classified
as a device for animal therapy of feline sarcomas and canine soft tissue sarcomas. Additionally, after a legal review, the Company believes
that the device classification obtained from the Food and Drug Administration FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine
is not limited to canine and feline sarcomas, but rather may be extended to a much broader population of veterinary cancers, including
all or most solid tumors in animals. We expect the result of such classification and label review will be that no additional regulatory
approvals are necessary for the use of IsoPet for the treatment of solid tumors in animals. The FDA does not have premarket
authority over devices with a veterinary classification, and the manufacturers are responsible for assuring that the product is safe,
effective, properly labeled, and otherwise in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 

Based
on the FDA s recommendation, RadioGel will be marketed as IsoPet for use by veterinarians
to avoid any confusion between animal and human therapy. The Company already has trademark protection for the IsoPet 
name. IsoPet and RadioGel are used synonymously throughout this document. The only distinction between
IsoPet and RadioGel is the FDA s recommendation that we use IsoPet 
for veterinarian usage, and reserve RadioGel for human therapy. Based on these developments, the Company
has shifted its primary focus to the development and marketing of Isopet for animal therapy, through the Company s IsoPet 
 Solutions division.

Financing
and Strategy 

In
November 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC qualified the Company s offering of its Common
Stock under Regulation A of Section 3(6) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act )( Regulation
A ), which offering was and amended from time to time thereafter (the 2019 Regulation A+ Offering ). In
September 2021, the SEC qualified the Company s offering of Common Stock under Regulation A, which offering was amended from time
to time thereafter (together with the 2019 Regulation A+ Offering, the Prior Regulation A+ Offerings ). During the
year ended December 31, 2023, 1,179,245 was raised through the sale of 16,132,000 shares of Common Stock and the private placement of
18,797,000 warrants. During the period January 1, 2024 through May 10, 2024, the Company raised 834,000 through the issuance of 13,000,000
shares of Common Stock and the private placement of 2,000,000 warrants. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
raised 839,000 through the issuance of 13,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 7,000,000 warrants. The Company s Prior Regulation
A Offerings undertaken pursuant to Regulation A+ have raised approximately 6,000,000 from the sale of shares of Common Stock. 

On
July 17, 2024, the SEC qualified the Company s offering under Regulation A to offer up to 60,000,000 shares of its Common Stock
(the July 2024 Regulation A+ Offering ). 

The
Company anticipates using the proceeds from the July 2024 Regulation A+ Offering as follows: 

For
the animal therapy market: 

Expand
 communication on our website, our social media presence, conference, and journals, each to increase the number of certified clinics
 for small animal and equine therapy and to increase the number of patients; 

Subsidize
 some IsoPet therapies, if necessary, to ensure that all viable candidates are treated; and 

Assist
 a new regional clinic with their license and certification training. 

For
the human market: 

Enhance
 the pedigree of the Quality Management System; 

Begin
 automation of product manufacturing; 

Fund
 liability insurance for human clinical studies; and 

Fund
 human clinical studies in the U.S. 

Research
and development of the Company s precision radionuclide therapy product line has been funded with proceeds from the sale of equity
and debt securities, including from the Prior Regulation A+ Offerings. The Company requires additional funding of approximately 2.5
million annually to maintain operating activities. Over the next 36 months, the Company believes it will cost approximately 8.0 to 9.0
million to: (1) fund the FDA approval process to conduct human clinical trials; (2) conduct Phase I, pilot, clinical trials; (3) activate
several regional clinics to administer IsoPet across the county; (4) create an independent production center within the current
production site to create a template for future international manufacturing; and (5) initiate regulatory approval processes outside of
the United States. The proceeds raised from the Prior Regulation A+ Offerings were used to fund this development and proceeds from the
July 2024 Regulation A+ Offering will used to continue such development efforts. 

The
continued deployment of the precision radionuclide therapy products and a worldwide regulatory approval effort will require additional
resources and personnel. The principal variables in the timing and amount of spending for the precision radionuclide therapy products
in the next 12 to 24 months will be the FDA s classification of the Company s precision radionuclide therapy products as
Class II or Class III devices (or otherwise) and any requirements for additional studies which may possibly include clinical studies.
Thereafter, the principal variables in the amount of the Company s spending and its financing requirements would be the timing
of any approvals and the nature of the Company s arrangements with third parties for manufacturing, sales, distribution, and licensing
of those products and the products success in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Company intends to fund its activities through strategic
transactions such as licensing and partnership agreements or from proceeds raised from the Prior Regulation A+ Offering and from the
July 2024 Regulation A+ Offering. 

The
Company intends to expand the indications for use in phases: first, for lymph nodes associated with thyroid cancer, secondly, cancerous
lung nodules, and finally, all non-sectable solid tumors. It is anticipated that the medical community may begin to use RadioGel off-label,
we will support but will not encourage that practice. 

Following
receipt of required regulatory approvals and financing, in the U.S., the Company intends to outsource material aspects of manufacturing,
distribution, sales, and marketing. Outside of the U.S., the Company intends to pursue licensing arrangements and/or partnerships to
facilitate its global commercialization strategy. 

21 

Long-term,
the Company intends to consider resuming research efforts with respect to other products and technologies, such as Gamma Gel and Alpha
Gel intended to help improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other illnesses. These long-term goals are subject to the Company:
(1) receiving adequate funding; (2) receiving regulatory approval for RadioGel and other precision radionuclide therapy
products; and (3) being able to successfully commercialize its precision radionuclide therapy products. 

Based
on the Company s financial history since inception, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm has expressed
substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has limited revenue, nominal cash, and
has accumulated deficits since inception. If the Company cannot obtain sufficient additional capital, the Company will be required to
delay the implementation of its business strategy and may not be able to continue operations. 

The
Company s headquarters are in the State of Washington., The initial focus of the animal therapy market has been the Northwestern
sector of the U.S. The Company has initiated marketing efforts to the animal therapy market in other regions of the U.S., attempting
to increase the exposure to our product and increase revenue opportunities. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had 1,218,160 cash on hand. There are currently commitments to vendors for products and services
purchased. To continue the development of the Company s products, the current level of cash will be insufficient to cover the fixed
and variable obligations of the Company. The Company has focused on operating on minimum overhead, including using a virtual office for
the last several years and retaining experienced industry consultants available on an as needed basis. This has helped focus the capital
received from the Company s Regulation A+ Offerings on activities that enhance our objectives. 

No
assurances can be given that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or to do so on terms advantageous to the Company or its
stockholders. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its
ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. The Company
plans to seek additional funding to maintain its operations through debt and equity financings and to improve operating performance through
a focus on strategic products and increased efficiencies in business processes and improvements to the cost structure. There is no assurance
that the Company will be successful in its efforts to raise additional working capital or achieve profitable operations. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Available
Information 

The
Company prepares and files annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and certain other
information with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information
regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Moreover, the Company maintains a website at http://www.radiogel.com
that contains important information about the Company, including biographies of key management personnel, as well as information about
the Company s business. This information is publicly available and is updated regularly.

expense from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to an increase in professional fees from 1,205,819 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 to 1,310,604 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially attributable to the stock based compensation expense related

2023 to 143,468 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024; a decrease in research and development expense from 300,586 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 to 223,660 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the Company ramped up the development of

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 1,195,505, as compared to working capital of 1,365,120 at December 31, 2023.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company experienced negative cash flow from operations of 1,213,127 and
 829,886 and had no cash from investing activities. In both 2024 and 2023, there were no investing activities, and in 2024 and 2023,
the Company raised 839,000 and 650,665 from the sales of Common Stock and warrants as part of our Regulation A+ Offerings. We also
received 10,000 in September 2023 from advances from our CEO that was repaid in October 2023.As of September 30, 2024, the Company did
not have any commitments for capital expenditures. 

Cash
used in operating activities increased from 829,886 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,213,127 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. Cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of the Company s non-cash items, such as loss from
operations, stock-based compensation, as well as the changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expense and accounts payable in 2024 compared
to only having net changes from current assets and liabilities and stock-based compensation in 2023. 

The
Company has generated material operating losses since inception. The Company had a net loss of 1,887,260 and 1,818,534 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company expects to continue to experience net operating losses for the foreseeable
future. Historically, the Company has relied upon investor funds to maintain its operations and develop the Company s business.
The Company anticipates raising additional capital within the next twelve months for working capital as well as business expansion, although
no assurances can be given that such additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company
is unable to obtain additional financing to meet its working capital requirements, it may have to curtail its business or cease all operations. 

The
Company requires funding of at least 5 million per year to maintain current operating activities. Over the next 24 months, the Company
believes it will cost approximately 9 million to: (1) fund the FDA approval process to conduct human clinical trials; (2) conduct Phase
I, pilot, and clinical trials; (3) activate several regional clinics to administer IsoPet across the county; (4) create
an independent production center within the current production site to create a template for future international manufacturing; and
(5) initiate regulatory approval processes outside of the United States. 

The
principal variables in the timing and amount of spending for the brachytherapy products in the next 12 to 24 months will be the FDA s
classification of the Company s brachytherapy products as Class II or Class III devices (or otherwise) and any requirements for
additional studies, which may possibly include clinical studies. Thereafter, the principal variables in the amount of the Company s
spending and its financing requirements would be the timing of any approvals and the nature of the Company s arrangements with
third parties for manufacturing, sales, distribution and licensing of those products and the products success in the U.S. and
elsewhere. The Company intends to fund its activities through strategic transactions such as licensing and partnership agreements or
additional capital raises. 

Although
the Company is seeking to raise additional capital and has engaged in numerous discussions with investment bankers and investors, to
date the Company has not received firm commitments for the required funding. Based upon its discussions, the Company anticipates that
if the Company is able to obtain the funding required to retire outstanding debt, pay past due payables and maintain its current operating
activities, that the terms and conditions associated with such future funding will result in material dilution to existing shareholders. 

Recent
geopolitical events, including the inherent instability and volatility in global capital markets, as well as the lack of liquidity in
the capital markets, could also impact the Company s ability to obtain financing and its ability to execute its business plan. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer currently works from his home office in virtual communication with key personnel. Cadwell Laboratories, which
is controlled by Carl Cadwell, a director of the Company, provides office space to management on an as-needed basis until such time as
the Company leases permanent office space.

Accounting
Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited condensed financial
statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
During the period ended September 30, 2024, we believe there have been no significant changes to the items disclosed as significant accounting
policies in management s notes to the financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,
filed on March 18, 2024. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s
financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

This
item is not applicable to us because we are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Based
on an evaluation as of the date of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Interim
Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Interim
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, because of material weakness related to proper segregation of duties, the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Interim Chief Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended September
30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting. 

The
term internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the registrant s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the registrant s
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes
those policies and procedures that: 

(a) 
 Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the registrant; 

(b) 
 Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the registrant are being made only in accordance
 with authorizations of management and directors of the registrant; and 

(c) 
 Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the registrant s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

26 

PART
II 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

The
Company may, from time to time, be involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business. Historically, the
outcome of all such legal proceedings has not, in the aggregate, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 

From
January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, the Company issued 13,000,000 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase 7,000,000 shares
of Common Stock pursuant to the Regulation A+ Offering for cash proceeds of 839,000. 

The
Company issued 441,252 shares of Common Stock for services rendered valued at 69,395. 

The
Company issued 16,919,918 shares of Common Stock in the cashless exercise of 25,034,000 warrants.
