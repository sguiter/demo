 material potential exposure to loss as a result of DTE Energy's variable interests through these long-term purchase and sale contracts. In addition, there is material potential exposure to loss as a result of DTE Electric's variable interests through these long-term purchase contracts. 
 DTE Electric previously financed regulatory assets for deferred costs related to certain retired generation plants and its tree trimming surge program through the sale of bonds by wholly-owned special purpose entities, DTE Securitization I and DTE Securitization II (collectively "the DTE Securitization entities"). The DTE Securitization entities are VIEs. DTE Electric has the power to direct the most significant activities of these entities, including performing servicing activities such as billing and collecting surcharge revenue. Accordingly, DTE Electric is the primary beneficiary and the DTE Securitization entities are consolidated by the Registrants. Securitization bond holders have no recourse to the Registrants' assets, except for those held by the DTE Securitization entities. Surcharges collected by DTE Electric to pay for bond servicing and other qualified costs reflect securitization property solely owned by the DTE Securitization entities. These surcharges are remitted to a trustee and are not available to other creditors of the Registrants.

 (a) For DTE Energy, the current portion is included in Current Assets Other on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. For DTE Electric, the noncurrent portion is included in Other Assets Other. 
 The allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable for the utility entities is generally calculated using an aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies. DTE Electric and DTE Gas establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical losses and management's assessment of existing and future economic conditions, customer trends and other factors. Customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the due date, which is typically in days, however, factors such as assistance programs may delay aggressive action. DTE Electric and DTE Gas generally assess late payment fees on trade receivables based on past-due terms with customers. Customer accounts are written off when collection efforts have been exhausted. The time period for write-off is days after service has been terminated. 
 The customer allowance for doubtful accounts for non-utility businesses and other receivables for both utility and non-utility businesses is generally calculated based on specific review of probable future collections based on receivable balances generally in excess of days. Existing and future economic conditions, customer trends and other factors are also considered. Receivables are written off on a specific identification basis and determined based upon the specific circumstances of the associated receivable. 
 Notes receivable for DTE Energy are primarily comprised of finance lease receivables and loans that are included in Notes Receivable and Other current assets on DTE Energy's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Notes receivable for DTE Electric are primarily comprised of loans.

 to days. If amounts are no longer probable of collection, the Registrants may consider the note receivable impaired, adjust the allowance, and cease accruing interest (nonaccrual status). 
 Cash payments received on nonaccrual status notes receivable, that do not bring the account contractually current, are first applied to the contractually owed past due interest, with any remainder applied to principal. Accrual of interest is generally resumed when the note receivable becomes contractually current.

 Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations 
 In accordance with optional exemptions available under Topic 606, the Registrants did not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (1) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, (2) with the exception of fixed consideration, contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Registrants have the right to invoice for goods provided and services performed, and (3) contracts for which variable consideration relates entirely to an unsatisfied performance obligation. 
 Such contracts consist of varying types of performance obligations across the segments, including the supply and delivery of energy related products and services. Contracts with variable volumes and/or variable pricing, including those with pricing provisions tied to a consumer price or other index, have also been excluded as the related consideration under the contract is variable at inception of the contract. Contract lengths vary from cancellable to multi-year.

 million based on a projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2025, and an increase in return on equity from to . The request reflects a net increase to customer rates of only million, as an existing IRM surcharge of million would be rolled into the new base rates. The requested increase is primarily due to increased investments in plant related to system reliability and pipeline safety and inflationary impacts on operating costs, partially offset by higher sales. A final MPSC order in this case is expected in November 2024. 
 2024 Electric Rate Case Filing 
 DTE Electric filed a rate case with the MPSC on March 28, 2024 requesting an increase in base rates of million based on a projected twelve-month period ending December 31, 2025, and an increase in return on equity from to . The requested increase in base rates was primarily due to the capital investments required to support continued reliability improvements and the ongoing transition to cleaner energy. The requested increase in base rates was also due to the increased cost of debt resulting from market dynamics and increasing operating and maintenance expenses. A final MPSC order in this case is expected in January 2025.

 Private equity and other assets include a diversified group of funds that are classified as NAV assets. These funds primarily invest in limited partnerships, including private equity, private real estate and private credit. Distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying fund assets over the life of the funds. There are generally no redemption rights. The limited partner must hold the fund for its life or find a third-party buyer, which may need to be approved by the general partner. The funds are established with varied contractual durations generally in the range of years to years. The fund life can often be extended by several years by the general partner, and further extended with the approval of the limited partners. Unfunded commitments related to these investments totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 The unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the electricity and natural gas commodity types consist of inputs that are less observable due in part to lack of available broker quotes, supported by little, if any, market activity at the measurement date or are based on internally developed models. Certain basis prices (i.e., the difference in pricing between two locations) included in the valuation of natural gas and electricity contracts were deemed unobservable. The weighted average price for unobservable inputs was calculated using the average of forward price curves for natural gas and electricity and the absolute value of monthly volumes. 
 The inputs listed above would have had a direct impact on the fair values of the above security types if they were adjusted. A significant increase (decrease) in the basis price would have resulted in a higher (lower) fair value for long positions, with offsetting impacts to short positions.

 Other Securities 
 At September 30, 2024, DTE Energy had billion invested in time deposit accounts with an original maturity of greater than three months, which is included in Current investments on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The investment does not include quoted prices, but the fair value is otherwise directly observable. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, DTE Energy securities included in Other long-term investments on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position consisted primarily of investments within DTE Energy's rabbi trust. The rabbi trust is comprised primarily of trading securities recorded at fair value, as well as debt securities classified as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost. The trust was established to fund certain non-qualified pension benefits, and therefore changes in market value of the trading securities and interest on the held-to-maturity securities are recognized in earnings. Gains and losses are allocated from DTE Energy to DTE Electric and are included in Other Income or Other Expense, respectively, in the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains (losses) related to the trading securities were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Various subsidiaries and equity investees of DTE Energy have entered into derivative and non-derivative contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by DTE Energy. These contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that DTE Energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE Energy s credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. Certain of these provisions (known as "hard triggers") state specific circumstances under which DTE Energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as "soft triggers") are not as specific. For contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which DTE Energy may ultimately be required to post. The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily natural gas, power, and environmental) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions. As of September 30, 2024, DTE Energy's contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, DTE Energy had million of derivatives in net liability positions, for which hard triggers exist. There is collateral that has been posted against such liabilities, including cash and letters of credit. Associated derivative net asset positions for which contractual offset exists were million. The net remaining amount of million is derived from the million noted above.

 The unsecured revolving credit agreements require a total funded debt to capitalization ratio of no more than to 1 for DTE Energy and to 1 for DTE Electric and DTE Gas. In the agreements, "total funded debt" means all indebtedness of each respective company and their consolidated subsidiaries, including finance lease obligations, hedge agreements, and guarantees of third parties debt, but excluding contingent obligations, nonrecourse and junior subordinated debt, and certain equity-linked securities and, except for calculations at the end of the second quarter, certain DTE Gas short-term debt.

 billion. DTE Electric does t anticipate additional capital expenditures for air pollution requirements, subject to the results of future rulemakings. 
 Water In response to EPA regulations and in accordance with the Clean Water Act section 316(b), DTE Electric was required to examine alternatives for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at several of its facilities. A final rule became effective in October 2014, which required studies to be completed and submitted as part of the NPDES permit application process to determine the type of technology needed to reduce impacts to fish. DTE Electric has completed the required studies and submitted reports for most of its generation plants, and a final study is in-process for Monroe power plant. Final compliance for the installation of any required technology to reduce the impacts of water intake structures will be determined by the state on a case by case, site specific basis. 
 DTE Electric is currently evaluating the compliance options and working with the state of Michigan on identifying any necessary controls or modifications to existing intake structures. DTE Electric's current capital plan includes an estimated million of compliance-related expenditures for Belle River power plant after its conversion. Projected capital expenditures have decreased as a result of Monroe power plant's expected retirement and the planned conversion of the Belle River power plant to natural gas. However, discussions with the state are ongoing. 
 As part of the Monroe power plant NPDES permit, EGLE has added an option to evaluate the thermal discharge of the facility as it relates to Clean Water Act section 316(a) regulations in order to establish an appropriate temperature discharge limit. DTE Electric has submitted to EGLE a biological demonstration study plan to evaluate the thermal discharge impacts to an aquatic community. After approval of the plan by EGLE and completion of field sampling, data will be processed and compiled into a comprehensive report. At the present time, DTE Electric cannot predict the outcome of this evaluation or financial impact.

 former MGP sites. The investigations at the former MGP sites have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing. Cleanup of one of the MGP sites is complete, and that site is closed. DTE Electric has also completed partial closure of one additional site. Cleanup activities associated with the remaining sites will continue over the next several years. In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Electric is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including the area surrounding an ash landfill, electrical distribution substations, electric generating power plants, and underground and above ground storage tank locations. The findings of these investigations indicated that the estimated cost to remediate these sites is expected to be incurred over the next several years. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, DTE Electric had million accrued for remediation. These costs are not discounted to their present value. Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Electric s financial position and cash flows. DTE Electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each site. 
 Coal Combustion Residuals and Effluent Limitations Guidelines A final EPA rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals, commonly known as coal ash, became effective in October 2015 and has continued to be updated in subsequent years. The rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a non-hazardous waste and relies on various self-implementation design and performance standards. DTE Electric currently owns and operates multiple coal ash storage facilities to manage coal ash from coal-fired power plants that are subject to federal, state, and local CCR and solid waste regulations. At certain facilities, the rule required ongoing sampling and testing of monitoring wells, compliance with groundwater standards, and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant. 
 On August 28, 2020, Part A of the CCR rule was published in the Federal Register and required all unlined impoundments to initiate closure as soon as technically feasible, but no later than April 11, 2021. Additionally, the rule amends certain reporting requirements and CCR website requirements. On November 12, 2020, Part B of the CCR Rule was published in the Federal Register and provides a process to determine if certain unlined impoundments with an alternative liner system may be sufficiently protective and therefore may continue to operate. 
 DTE Electric submitted applications to the EPA that support continued use of all impoundments through their active lives. DTE Electric subsequently ceased receipt of waste at the St. Clair power plant bottom ash basins and initiated closure, resulting in withdrawal of the Part A demonstration for the plant. Additionally, DTE Electric implemented projects at the Belle River and Monroe power plants to cease receipt of waste within any unlined CCR impoundments, resulting in withdrawals of the Part B applications for those plants. 
 On May 8, 2024, the EPA finalized a new rule to regulate legacy CCR surface impoundments and CCR management units. The rule expands the reach of the CCR rule to inactive electric generation sites and previously unregulated CCR at any active facility. DTE Electric is in the process of evaluating the final rule, which may have significant financial impacts depending on the site-specific characteristics of the units that are regulated by the new rule. Long-term financial impacts cannot be clearly defined at this time and likely will not be clearly defined until the regulated units are identified. Challenges to the rule have been filed, and DTE Electric will continue to monitor for regulatory developments. The preliminary cost estimate to comply with the revised rule is approximately million as of September 30, 2024, and is recorded to Asset retirement obligations. The estimate will be updated as necessary when site-specific details are more fully known. These costs are expected to be recoverable under the regulatory construct as part of removal costs. 
 At the state level, legislation was signed in December 2018 and provides for further regulation of the CCR program in Michigan. Additionally, the statutory revision provides the basis of a CCR program that EGLE has submitted to the EPA for approval to fully regulate the CCR program in Michigan in lieu of a federal permit program. The EPA is currently working with EGLE in reviewing the submitted state program, and DTE Electric will work with EGLE to implement the state program that may be approved in the future. 
 The EPA has updated and revised the ELG in 2015, 2020, and 2024. In each revision, EPA has re-established technology-based standards applicable to wastewaters created at facilities with an electrical generating unit. In each revision, the EPA also established new applicability dates.

 million of capital expenditures, including million for 2024 through 2028. This estimate may change in future periods as DTE Electric evaluates the CCR and ELG rules discussed above that have recently been finalized. 
 DTE Gas 
 Contaminated and Other Sites DTE Gas owns or previously owned former MGP sites. Investigations have revealed contamination related to the by-products of gas manufacturing at each site. Cleanup of MGP sites is complete and those sites are closed. DTE Gas has also completed partial closure of additional sites. Cleanup activities associated with the remaining sites will continue over the next several years. The MPSC has established a cost deferral and rate recovery mechanism for investigation and remediation costs incurred at former MGP sites. In addition to the MGP sites, DTE Gas is also in the process of cleaning up other contaminated sites, including gate stations, gas pipeline releases, and underground storage tank locations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, DTE Gas had million and million, respectively, accrued for remediation. These costs are not discounted to their present value. Any change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for the sites and affect DTE Gas' financial position and cash flows. DTE Gas anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the MPSC, which allows for amortization of the MGP costs over a period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs were incurred, will prevent the associated investigation and remediation costs from having a material adverse impact on DTE Gas' results of operations. 
 Air In March 2023, the EPA published the Good Neighbor Rule, which includes provisions for compressor engines operated for the transportation of natural gas. In June 2024, the United States Supreme Court issued an opinion granting emergency applications to stay the Good Neighbor Rule. The stay will remain in effect during other litigation. The status of the rule remains uncertain as litigation is ongoing. At this time, DTE Gas does not expect a significant financial impact.

None of the represented employees have contracts expiring within one year for DTE Electric. 
 Purchase Commitments 
 Utility capital expenditures and expenditures for non-utility businesses will be approximately billion and billion in 2024 for DTE Energy and DTE Electric, respectively. The Registrants have made certain commitments in connection with the estimated 2024 annual capital expenditures. 
 Ludington Plant Contract Dispute 
 DTE Electric and Consumers Energy Company ("Consumers"), joint owners of the Ludington Hydroelectric Pumped Storage plant ("Ludington"), are parties to a 2010 engineering, procurement, and construction agreement with Toshiba America Energy Systems ("TAES"), under which TAES contracted to perform a major overhaul and upgrade of Ludington. The overhauled Ludington units are operational, but TAES' work has been defective and non-conforming. DTE Electric and Consumers have demanded that TAES provide a comprehensive plan to resolve those matters, including adherence to its warranty commitments and other contractual obligations. DTE Electric and Consumers have taken extensive efforts to resolve these issues with TAES, including a formal demand to TAES' parent, Toshiba Corporation, under a parent guaranty it provided. TAES has not provided a comprehensive plan or otherwise met its performance obligations. In order to enforce the contract, DTE Electric and Consumers filed a complaint against TAES and Toshiba Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in April 2022. 
 In June 2022, TAES and Toshiba Corporation filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, along with counterclaims seeking approximately million in damages related to payments allegedly owed under the parties' contract. During September 2022, the motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. DTE Electric believes the outstanding counterclaims are without merit, but would be liable for of the damages if approved. In October 2022, the combined parties submitted a joint discovery plan to proceed with the litigation process and a potential trial during the second half of 2025. DTE Electric cannot predict the financial impact or outcome of this matter. 
 In May 2023, the MPSC approved a jointly-filed request by DTE Electric and Consumers for authority to defer as a regulatory asset the costs associated with repairing or replacing the defective work performed by TAES while the litigation with TAES and Toshiba Corporation moves forward. DTE Electric currently estimates its share of these repair and replacement costs ranges from million to million. Such costs will be offset by any potential litigation proceeds received from TAES or Toshiba Corporation. DTE Electric and Consumers will have the opportunity to seek recovery and ratemaking treatment for amounts which are not recovered from TAES or Toshiba Corporation.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following combined discussion is separately filed by DTE Energy and DTE Electric. However, DTE Electric does not make any representations as to information related solely to DTE Energy or the subsidiaries of DTE Energy other than itself. 
 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 DTE Energy is a diversified energy company and is the parent company of DTE Electric and DTE Gas, regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales, distribution, and storage services throughout Michigan. DTE Energy also operates two energy-related non-utility segments with operations throughout the United States. 
 The following table summarizes DTE Energy's financial results: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions, except per share amounts) Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company 477 332 1,112 978 Diluted Earnings per Common Share 2.30 1.61 5.36 4.74 
 The increase in Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher earnings in the Electric and Corporate and Other segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the Energy Trading, Gas, and DTE Vantage segments. 
 STRATEGY 
 DTE Energy's strategy is to achieve long-term earnings per share growth with a strong balance sheet and attractive dividend. 
 DTE Energy's utilities are investing capital to support a modern, reliable grid and cleaner, affordable energy through investments in base infrastructure and new generation. Increasing intensity of windstorms and other weather events, coupled with increasing electric vehicle adoption, will drive a continued need for substantial grid investment over the long-term. 
 DTE Energy plans to reduce the carbon emissions of its electric utility operations by 65 in 2028, 85 in 2032, and 90 by 2040 from 2005 carbon emissions levels. DTE Energy plans to end its use of coal-fired power plants in 2032 and is committed to a net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 for its electric and gas utility operations. 
 Additionally, as a result of legislation passed by the state of Michigan in 2023, DTE Energy will be required to meet a 100 clean energy portfolio standard by 2040. Clean energy sources include renewables, nuclear, and natural gas-fired plants equipped with a carbon capture and storage system that is at least 90 effective in reducing carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The legislation also requires 50 of an electric utility's energy to be generated from renewable sources by 2030 and 60 by 2035. DTE Energy is currently assessing the impacts of this legislation and will include updates in its next Integrated Resource Plan to comply with the new requirements. 
 To achieve carbon reduction goals at the electric utility, DTE Energy will continue its transition away from coal-powered energy sources and is replacing or offsetting the generation from these facilities with renewable energy, natural gas, battery storage, and energy waste reduction initiatives. Refer to the "Capital Investments" section below for further discussion regarding DTE Energy's retirement of its aging coal-fired plants and transition to renewable energy and other sources. Over the long-term, DTE Energy is also monitoring the advancement of emerging technologies such as long-duration storage, modular nuclear reactors, and carbon capture and sequestration, and how these technologies may support clean, reliable generation and customer affordability. 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 For the gas utility, DTE Energy aims to cut carbon emissions across the entire value chain. DTE Energy plans to reduce the carbon emissions from its gas utility operations by 65 by 2030 and 80 by 2040, and is committed to a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 from internal gas operations and gas suppliers. To achieve net zero, DTE Energy is working to source gas with lower methane intensity, reduce emissions through its gas main renewal and pipeline integrity programs, and if necessary, use carbon offsets to address any remaining emissions. DTE Energy also aims to help DTE Gas customers reduce their emissions by approximately 35 by 2040 by increasing energy efficiency, pursuing advanced technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and sequestration, and through the CleanVision Natural Gas Balance program which provides customers the option to use carbon offsets and renewable natural gas. 
 DTE Energy expects that these initiatives at the electric and gas utilities will continue to provide significant opportunities for capital investments and result in earnings growth. DTE Energy is focused on executing its plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability. To support its goals for customer affordability, DTE Energy is working to implement operational efficiencies and optimize opportunities from the Inflation Reduction Act to generate tax credits relating to renewable energy, nuclear generation, energy storage, and carbon capture and sequestration. These tax credits may reduce the cost of owning related assets and reduce customer rate impacts from any future cost recoveries. DTE Energy's utilities operate in a constructive regulatory environment and have solid relationships with their regulators. 
 DTE Energy also has significant investments in non-utility businesses and expects growth opportunities in its DTE Vantage segment. DTE Energy employs disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage its assets, skills, and expertise, and provides attractive returns and diversity in earnings and geography. Specifically, DTE Energy invests in targeted markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with its risk profile. 
 A key priority for DTE Energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced financing. Growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt and equity. DTE Energy has an enterprise risk management program that, among other things, is designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes, interest rates, and counterparty credit risk. 
 CAPITAL INVESTMENTS 
 DTE Energy's utility businesses will require significant capital investments to maintain and improve the electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and achieve goals for carbon emission reductions. Capital plans may be regularly updated as these requirements and goals evolve and may be subject to regulatory approval. 
 DTE Electric's capital investments over the 2024-2028 period are estimated at 20 billion, comprised of 9 billion for distribution infrastructure, 4 billion for base infrastructure, and 7 billion for cleaner generation including renewables. 
 DTE Electric has retired all eleven coal-fired generation units at the Trenton Channel, River Rouge, and St. Clair facilities, and plans to repurpose the Trenton Channel plant to a battery energy storage system in 2026. DTE Electric has also announced plans to retire its remaining six coal-fired generating units, including converting the two units at the Belle River facility from a base load coal plant to a natural gas peaking resource in 2025-2026. The four units at the Monroe facility are expected to be retired in two stages in 2028 and 2032. Generation from the retired facilities will continue to be replaced or offset with a combination of renewables, energy waste reduction, demand response, battery storage, and natural gas fueled generation. 
 DTE Gas' capital investments over the 2024-2028 period are estimated at 3.7 billion, comprised of 2.1 billion for base infrastructure and 1.6 billion for the gas renewal program, which includes main and service renewals, meter move-out, and pipeline integrity projects. 
 DTE Electric and DTE Gas plan to seek regulatory approval for capital expenditures consistent with ratemaking treatment. 
 DTE Energy's non-utility businesses' capital investments are primarily for expansion, growth, and ongoing maintenance in the DTE Vantage segment, including approximately 1 billion to 1.5 billion from 2024-2028 for renewable energy projects and custom energy solutions, while expanding into carbon capture and sequestration.

 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 The Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulations, including those addressing climate change. Additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented. Actual costs to comply could vary substantially. The Registrants expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to customers, as authorized by the MPSC. 
 Increased costs for energy produced from traditional coal-based sources due to recent, pending, and future regulatory initiatives could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable, natural gas fueled generation, and/or nuclear sources, energy waste reduction initiatives, and the potential development of market-based trading of carbon instruments. 
 For further discussion of environmental matters, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Commitments and Contingencies." 
 OUTLOOK 
 The next few years will be a period of rapid change for DTE Energy and for the energy industry. DTE Energy's strong utility base, combined with its integrated non-utility operations, position it well for long-term growth. 
 Looking forward, DTE Energy will focus on several areas that are expected to improve future performance: 
 electric and gas customer satisfaction; 
 electric distribution system reliability; 
 new electric generation and storage; 
 gas distribution system renewal; 
 reducing carbon emissions at the electric and gas utilities; 
 rate competitiveness and affordability; 
 regulatory stability and investment recovery for the electric and gas utilities; 
 strategic investments in growth projects at DTE Vantage; 
 employee engagement, health, safety and wellbeing, and diversity, equity, and inclusion; 
 cost structure optimization across all business segments; and 
 cash, capital, and liquidity to maintain or improve financial strength. 
 DTE Energy will continue to pursue opportunities to grow its businesses in a disciplined manner if it can secure opportunities that meet its strategic, financial, and risk criteria.

 Nine Months (In millions) Coal - higher consumption and higher prices 68 Higher transmission expenses 38 Purchased power - MISO refund in 2023 and higher volumes in 2024 primarily due to higher demand 32 Nuclear fuel - lower amortization due to refueling outage in 2024 (5) Other 2 135 
 Operation and maintenance expense decreased 25 million and 31 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to lower distribution operations expense of 38 million (primarily due to lower storm restoration costs), lower plant generation expense of 9 million, and lower EWR expense of 6 million, partially offset by higher RPS expense of 15 million, higher uncollectible expense of 11 million, and higher legal expense of 4 million. The decrease in the nine-month period was primarily due to lower distribution operations expense of 113 million (primarily due to lower storm restoration costs), partially offset by one-time costs of 32 million resulting from the voluntary separation incentive program, higher RPS expense of 22 million, higher uncollectible expense of 15 million, higher legal expense of 7 million, and higher plant generation expense of 6 million. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 28 million and 86 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to a higher depreciable base. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to a higher depreciable base of 77 million and an increase of 6 million associated with the TRM. 
 Taxes other than income increased 3 million and 7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher property taxes. 
 Other (Income) and Deductions decreased 7 million and increased 13 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to higher AFUDC equity earnings of 15 million and higher investment earnings of 8 million, partially offset by higher net interest expense of 16 million. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher net interest expense of 59 million, partially offset by higher AFUDC equity earnings of 35 million and higher investment earnings of 9 million. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) changed 120 million and 100 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The change in both periods was primarily due to higher investment tax credits related to 2024 solar projects and higher nuclear production tax credits, partially offset by higher earnings. The impact of tax credits are offset in Operating Revenues through various regulatory mechanisms and have no impact on Net Income. 
 Outlook DTE Electric will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustain strong cash flows, and earn its authorized return on equity. DTE Electric expects that planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth. DTE Electric will maintain a strong focus on customers by increasing reliability and satisfaction while working to keep customer rate increases affordable. Looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather, the outcome of regulatory proceedings, uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding environmental compliance, and effects of energy waste reduction programs. 
 DTE Electric filed a rate case with the MPSC on March 28, 2024 requesting an increase in base rates of 456 million based on a projected twelve-month period ending December 31, 2025, and an increase in return on equity from 9.9 to 10.5 . The requested increase in base rates was primarily due to the capital investments required to support continued reliability improvements and the ongoing transition to cleaner energy. The requested increase in base rates was also due to the increased cost of debt resulting from market dynamics and increasing operating and maintenance expenses. A final MPSC order in this case is expected in January 2025.

Table of Contents 

 Operation and maintenance expense increased 10 million and 23 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to higher uncollectible expense of 7 million and higher gas operations expense of 5 million. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher gas operations expense of 13 million, one-time costs resulting from the voluntary separation incentive program of 8 million, and higher uncollectible expense of 6 million, partially offset by lower legal expenses of 2 million. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 6 million and 13 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in both periods was primarily due to a higher depreciable base. 
 Taxes other than income expense increased 2 million and 7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher property taxes. 
 Other (Income) and Deductions increased 1 million and 6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher net interest expense of 10 million partially offset by lower non-operating retirement benefits expense of 2 million and higher investment earnings of 2 million. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) increased 2 million and decreased 13 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease in the nine-month period was primarily due to lower earnings. 
 Outlook DTE Gas will continue to move forward in its efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustain strong cash flows, and earn its authorized return on equity. DTE Gas expects that planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth. Looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather and the outcome of regulatory proceedings. DTE Gas expects to continue its efforts to improve productivity and decrease costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability. 
 DTE Gas filed a rate case with the MPSC on January 8, 2024 requesting an increase in base rates of 266 million based on a projected twelve-month period ending September 30, 2025, and an increase in return on equity from 9.9 to 10.25 . The request reflects a net increase to customer rates of only 160 million, as an existing IRM surcharge of 106 million would be rolled into the new base rates. The requested increase is primarily due to increased investments in plant related to system reliability and pipeline safety and inflationary impacts on operating costs, partially offset by higher sales. A final MPSC order in this case is expected in November 2024.

 DTE VANTAGE 
 The DTE Vantage segment is comprised primarily of renewable energy projects that sell electricity and pipeline-quality gas and projects that deliver custom energy solutions to industrial, commercial, and institutional customers. DTE Vantage results and outlook are discussed below: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (In millions) Operating Revenues Non-utility operations 190 199 555 572 Operating Expenses Fuel, purchased power, and gas non-utility 87 98 279 288 Operation and maintenance 66 50 199 171 Depreciation and amortization 14 14 43 39 Taxes other than income 2 2 8 7 Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net (12) (1) (9) 169 152 528 496 Operating Income 21 47 27 76 Other (Income) and Deductions (23) (7) (66) (25) Income Taxes Expense 13 15 25 28 Tax credits (2) (17) (6) (36) 11 (2) 19 (8) Net Income Attributable to DTE Energy Company 33 56 74 109 
 Operating Revenues Non-utility operations decreased 9 million and 17 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease in both periods was due to the following: 
 Three Months Nine Months (In millions) Lower demand and prices in the Steel business (5) (16) Lower sales in the Renewables business (8) (6) Sale of project in the On-site business (3) New project in the On-site business 4 8 (9) (17) 
 Fuel, purchased power, and gas non-utility expense decreased 11 million and 9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease in both periods was due to the following: 
 Three Months Nine Months (In millions) Lower demand and prices in the Steel business (9) (12) Sale of project in the On-site business (3) Costs in the Renewables business (2) 6 (11) (9) 
 Operation and maintenance expense increased 16 million and 28 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to higher costs in the Renewables business of 6 million, On-site business of 5 million, and Steel business of 4 million. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher costs in the On-site business of 12 million, Renewables business of 8 million, and Steel business of 8 million. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 4 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to new projects in the Renewables business.

Table of Contents 

 Asset (gains) losses and impairments, net decreased 12 million and 8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to a gain in 2023 of 17 million resulting from a change in estimate of an asset retirement obligation in the Steel business, partially offset by asset write-offs in other business units of 5 million. The remaining decrease in the nine-month period was primarily due to settlement of contingent consideration relating to a 2017 acquisition in the Renewables business in 2023. 
 Other (Income) and Deductions increased 16 million and 41 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to higher interest income of 12 million associated with a new project in the On-site business and higher equity earnings of 8 million, partially offset by higher interest expense of 3 million. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher interest income of 28 million associated with a new project in the On-site business and a gain in the Renewables business of 25 million attributed to the sale of a partnership interest, partially offset by higher interest expense of 10 million. 
 Income Taxes Tax credits decreased 15 million and 30 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to investment tax credits related to new projects in the On-site and Renewables businesses in 2023. 
 Outlook DTE Vantage will continue to leverage its extensive energy-related operating experience and project management capability to develop additional renewable natural gas projects and other projects that will provide customer specific energy solutions. DTE Vantage is also developing decarbonization opportunities relating to carbon capture and sequestration projects. 

ENERGY TRADING 
 Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power, natural gas and environmental marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage positions. Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power, environmental, and related services, which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers' behalf and the supply or purchase of environmental attributes to various customers. Energy Trading results and outlook are discussed below:

 Operation and maintenance expense decreased 1 million and increased 7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher compensation costs. 
 Natural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future and/or natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related non-derivative pipeline transportation contract. These gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are marked-to-market without revaluing the related non-derivative contracts. 
 Operating Income decreased 30 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which includes a 15 million unfavorable change in timing related gains primarily related to gas strategies that will reverse in future periods as the underlying contracts settle. The decrease also includes a 9 million unfavorable change in timing related losses primarily related to gas strategies that were recognized in previous periods and reversed in the current period as the underlying contracts settled. 
 Operating Income decreased 212 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which includes a 139 million unfavorable change in timing related gains primarily related to gas strategies that will reverse in future periods as the underlying contracts settle. The decrease also includes a 93 million unfavorable change in timing related gains and losses primarily related to gas strategies that were recognized in previous periods and reversed in the current period as the underlying contracts settled. 
 Other (Income) and Deductions increased 1 million and changed 9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The change in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher interest income.

 Outlook In the near-term, Energy Trading expects market conditions to remain challenging. The profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices and the uncertainty of impacts associated with regulatory changes, and changes in operating rules of Regional Transmission Organizations. Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged. Most financial instruments, physical power and natural gas contracts, and certain environmental contracts are deemed derivatives; whereas, natural gas and environmental inventory, contracts for pipeline transportation, storage assets, and some environmental contracts are not derivatives. As a result, Energy Trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. Energy Trading's strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps, and options. This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods. 
 See also the "Fair Value" section herein and Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Fair Value" and "Financial and Other Derivative Instruments," respectively. 

CORPORATE AND OTHER 
 Corporate and Other includes various holding company activities, holds certain non-utility debt, and holds certain investments, including investments supporting regional development and economic growth. The net loss of 22 million and 83 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, represents a decrease of 30 million and 19 million from the net loss of 52 million and 102 million in the comparable 2023 periods. The decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to the effective tax rate adjustments. The decrease in the nine-month period was primarily due to the effective tax rate adjustments and higher equity investment income, partially offset by higher net interest expense and higher state income taxes. 
 Outlook Corporate and Other will continue to support DTE Energy's goals to achieve long-term earnings growth by managing corporate costs such as interest and tax expense. Corporate and Other will also continue to support DTE Energy in achieving a strong balance sheet, access to capital markets, and implementation of a financing plan that includes interest rate management in order to manage interest costs. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 Cash Requirements 
 DTE Energy uses cash to maintain and invest in the electric and natural gas utilities, to grow the non-utility businesses, to retire and pay interest on long-term debt, and to pay dividends. DTE Energy believes it will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements. DTE Energy expects that cash from operations in 2024 will be approximately 3.3 billion. DTE Energy anticipates base level utility capital investments, including environmental, renewable, and energy waste reduction expenditures, and expenditures for non-utility businesses of approximately 4.7 billion in 2024. DTE Energy plans to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment. Capital spending for growth of existing or new non-utility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet strict risk-return and value creation criteria.

Table of Contents 

 Refer below for analysis of cash flows relating to operating, investing, and financing activities, which reflect DTE Energy's change in financial condition. Any significant non-cash items are included in the Supplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, as applicable. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In millions) 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash at Beginning of Period 51 43 Net cash from operating activities 2,559 2,375 Net cash used for investing activities (4,713) (2,941) Net cash from financing activities 3,126 589 Net Increase in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash 972 23 Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash at End of Period 1,023 66 
 Cash from Operating Activities 
 A majority of DTE Energy's operating cash flows are provided by the electric and natural gas utilities, which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather, electric retail access, regulatory deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions, changes in working capital, and operating costs. 
 Net cash from operations increased by 184 million in 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases in Net income, Depreciation and amortization, and working capital items, partially offset by decreases in cash related to deferred taxes and Allowance for equity funds used during construction. 
 The change in working capital items in 2024 was primarily due to increases in cash related to Accounts payable, Derivative assets and liabilities, and Other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities, partially offset by decreases in cash related to Accounts receivable, net and Inventories. 
 Cash used for Investing Activities 
 Cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures and acquisitions. In any given year, DTE Energy looks to realize cash from under-performing or non-strategic assets or matured, fully valued assets. 
 Capital spending within the utility businesses is primarily to maintain and improve electric generation and the electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy goals. 
 Capital spending within the non-utility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance, expansion, and growth. DTE Energy looks to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks, and returns. All new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis. DTE Energy has been disciplined in how it deploys capital and will not make investments unless they meet the criteria. For new business lines, DTE Energy initially invests based on research and analysis. DTE Energy starts with a limited investment, evaluates the results, and either expands or exits the business based on those results. In any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of DTE Energy, with a clear understanding of any potential impact on its credit ratings. 
 Net cash used for investing activities increased by 1.8 billion in 2024 primarily due to the Investment in time deposits and increases in utility plant and equipment expenditures and Notes receivable. 
 Cash from Financing Activities 
 DTE Energy relies on both short-term borrowing and long-term financing as a source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by its operations. 
 DTE Energy's strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity. DTE Energy targets balance sheet financial metrics to ensure it is consistent with the objective of a strong investment grade debt rating. 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash from financing activities increased by 2.5 billion in 2024 primarily due to increases in cash related to the Issuance of long-term debt, net of issuance costs and Redemption of long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in cash related to Short-term borrowings, net. 
 Outlook 
 Sources of Cash 
 DTE Energy expects cash flows from operations to increase over the long-term, primarily as a result of growth from the utility and non-utility businesses. Growth in the utilities is expected to be driven primarily by capital spending which will increase the base from which rates are determined. DTE Energy expects long-term growth in sales related to vehicle electrification, but no significant impacts in the near-term. Non-utility growth is expected from additional investments in the DTE Vantage segment, primarily related to renewable energy and custom energy solutions, while expanding into carbon capture and sequestration. DTE Vantage expects enhanced growth opportunities in decarbonization as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for renewable natural gas and carbon capture projects. 
 DTE Energy's utilities may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of various recovery and tracking mechanisms, as a result of timing of MPSC orders. Energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. DTE Energy continues its efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flows through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of long-term capital projects. 
 At the discretion of management and depending upon economic and financial market conditions, DTE Energy expects to issue up to 100 million of equity in 2024. DTE Energy anticipates these discretionary equity issuances to be made through contributions to the dividend reinvestment plan and/or employee benefit plans. 
 Over the long-term, DTE Energy does not have any equity commitments and will continue to evaluate equity needs on an annual basis. DTE Energy currently expects its primary source of long-term financing to be the issuance of debt and is monitoring changes in interest rates and impacts on the cost of borrowing. 
 Uses of Cash 
 DTE Energy has 3.2 billion in long-term debt, including securitization bonds and finance leases, maturing within twelve months. Repayment of the debt is expected to be made through internally generated funds, the issuance of short-term and/or long-term debt, and the redemption of time deposits. 
 DTE Energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for more than 100 consecutive years and expects to continue paying regular cash dividends in the future, including approximately 0.8 billion in 2024. Any payment of future dividends is subject to approval by the Board of Directors and may depend on DTE Energy's future earnings, capital requirements, and financial condition. Over the long-term, DTE Energy expects continued dividend growth and is targeting a payout ratio consistent with pure-play utility companies. 
 Various subsidiaries and equity investees of DTE Energy have entered into derivative and non-derivative contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by DTE Energy. These contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that DTE Energy post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that DTE Energy's credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. Certain of these provisions (known as "hard triggers") state specific circumstances under which DTE Energy can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as "soft triggers") are not as specific. For contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which DTE Energy may ultimately be required to post. The amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily natural gas, power, and environmental) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions. As of September 30, 2024, DTE Energy's contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was 420 million.

 Also refer to the "Capital Investments" section above regarding DTE Energy's capital strategy and estimated spend over the next five years. For additional information regarding DTE Energy's future cash obligations, including scheduled debt maturities and interest payments, minimum lease payments, and future purchase commitments, refer to DTE Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Liquidity 
 DTE Energy has approximately 3.0 billion of available liquidity at September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements. 
 DTE Energy believes it will have sufficient operating flexibility, cash resources, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet future operating cash and capital expenditure needs. However, virtually all of DTE Energy's businesses are capital intensive, or require access to capital, and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows. 

FAIR VALUE 
 Derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as Derivative assets or liabilities. Contracts DTE Energy typically classifies as derivative instruments include power, natural gas, some environmental contracts, and certain forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts. Items DTE Energy does not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas and environmental inventory, pipeline transportation contracts, storage assets, and some environmental contracts. See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Fair Value" and "Financial and Other Derivative Instruments," respectively. 
 The tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of non-derivative natural gas storage, transportation, certain power contracts, and some environmental contracts which are subject to accrual accounting. Consequently, gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods, resulting in volatility in the Registrants' reported period-by-period earnings; however, the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery and/or settlement. 
 The Registrants manage their MTM risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of their contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract. Accordingly, the Registrants record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under their contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or natural gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year). 
 The Registrants have established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). For further discussion of the fair value hierarchy, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Fair Value."

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Price Risk 
 The Electric and Gas businesses have commodity price risk, primarily related to the purchases of coal, natural gas, uranium, and electricity. However, the Registrants do not bear significant exposure to earnings risk, as such changes are included in the PSCR and GCR regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms. Earnings may be indirectly impacted if PSCR or GCR charges increase such that it impacts the collectability of receivables and increases uncollectible expense. Refer to the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts section below for additional information. 
 Changes in the price of natural gas can also impact the valuation of lost and unaccounted for gas, storage sales, and transportation services revenue at the Gas segment. The Gas segment manages its market price risk related to storage sales revenue primarily through the sale of long-term storage contracts. The Registrants are exposed to short-term cash flow or liquidity risk as a result of the time differential between actual cash settlements and regulatory rate recovery. 
 The DTE Vantage segment is subject to price risk for electricity, natural gas, coal products, and environmental attributes generated from its renewable natural gas investments. DTE Energy manages its exposure to commodity price risk through the use of long-term contracts and hedging instruments, when available. 
 DTE Energy's Energy Trading business segment has exposure to electricity, natural gas, environmental, crude oil, heating oil, and foreign currency exchange price fluctuations. These risks are managed by the energy marketing and trading operations through the use of forward energy, capacity, storage, options, and futures contracts, within predetermined risk parameters.

 Credit Risk 
 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 The Registrants regularly review contingent matters, existing and future economic conditions, customer trends and other factors relating to customers and their contracts and record provisions for amounts considered at risk of probable loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Registrants believe their accrued amounts are adequate for probable loss. The Registrants manage this risk by working at the state and federal levels to promote funding programs for low-income customers, providing energy assistance programs and support, and promoting timely customer payments through adherence to MPSC billing practice rules relating to payment arrangements, energy disconnects, and restores. 
 Trading Activities 
 DTE Energy is exposed to credit risk through trading activities. Credit risk is the potential loss that may result if the trading counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations. DTE Energy utilizes both external and internal credit assessments when determining the credit quality of trading counterparties. 
 The following table displays the credit quality of DTE Energy's trading counterparties as of September 30, 2024: 
 Credit Exposure Before Cash Collateral Cash Collateral Net Credit Exposure (In millions) Investment Grade (a) 
 A- and Greater 348 348 BBB+ and BBB 305 305 BBB- 9 9 Total Investment Grade 662 662 Non-investment grade (b) 
 17 17 Internally Rated investment grade (c) 
 307 (1) 306 Internally Rated non-investment grade (d) 
 5 5 Total 991 (1) 990 
 _______________________________________ 
 (a) This category includes counterparties with minimum credit ratings of Baa3 assigned by Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) or BBB-assigned by Standard Poor s Rating Group, a division of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Standard Poor s). The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented 28 of the total gross credit exposure. 
 (b) This category includes counterparties with credit ratings that are below investment grade. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented 2 of the total gross credit exposure. 
 (c) This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody s or Standard Poor s but are considered investment grade based on DTE Energy s evaluation of the counterparty s creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented 13 of the total gross credit exposure. 
 (d) This category includes counterparties that have not been rated by Moody s or Standard Poor s and are considered non-investment grade based on DTE Energy s evaluation of the counterparty s creditworthiness. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented less than 1 of the total gross credit exposure. 
 Other 
 The Registrants engage in business with customers that are non-investment grade. The Registrants closely monitor the credit ratings of these customers and, when deemed necessary and permitted under the tariffs, request collateral or guarantees from such customers to secure their obligations. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 DTE Energy is subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of debt. In order to manage interest costs, DTE Energy may use treasury locks and interest rate swap agreements. DTE Energy's exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from changes in U.S. Treasury rates, commercial paper rates, credit spreads, and SOFR. As of September 30, 2024, DTE Energy had floating rate debt of 966 million and a floating rate debt-to-total debt ratio of 4.0 . 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 DTE Energy has foreign currency exchange risk arising from market price fluctuations associated with fixed priced contracts. These contracts are denominated in Canadian dollars and are primarily for the purchase and sale of natural gas and power, as well as for long-term transportation capacity. To limit DTE Energy's exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations, DTE Energy has entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forward contracts through December 2032. 
 Summary of Sensitivity Analyses 
 Sensitivity analyses were performed on the fair values of commodity contracts for DTE Energy and long-term debt obligations for the Registrants. The commodity contracts listed below principally relate to energy marketing and trading activities. The sensitivity analyses involved increasing and decreasing forward prices and rates at September 30, 2024 and 2023 by a hypothetical 10 and calculating the resulting change in the fair values. The hypothetical losses related to long-term debt would be realized only if DTE Energy transferred all of its fixed-rate long-term debt to other creditors. 
 The results of the sensitivity analyses: 
 Assuming a 10 Increase in Prices/Rates Assuming a 10 Decrease in Prices/Rates As of September 30, As of September 30, Activity 2024 2023 2024 2023 Change in the Fair Value of (In millions) Environmental contracts (12) (7) 12 7 Commodity contracts Gas contracts 20 35 (20) (35) Commodity contracts Power contracts (3) 3 3 (4) Commodity contracts Oil contracts 1 (1) Commodity contracts Interest rate risk DTE Energy (775) (717) 826 776 Long-term debt Interest rate risk DTE Electric (491) (477) 531 524 Long-term debt

 DTE ENERGY COMPANY 
 2024 SERIES E 4.95 SENIOR NOTES DUE 2027 
 
 DTE ENERGY COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Michigan (herein referred to as the Company , which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of __________ on July 1, 2027 Stated Maturity with respect to the principal of this Note), unless previously redeemed, and to pay interest at the rate of 4.95 per annum on said principal sum from August 2, 2024, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal of this Note becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and premium and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the same rate per annum during such overdue period. Interest on this Note will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year (each such date, an Interest Payment Date ), commencing January 1, 2025. The amount of interest payable for any period shall be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. 
 
 In the event that any Interest Payment Date, redemption date or other date of Maturity of the Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the amount payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. A Business Day means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which commercial

banks in the state of New York or the state of Michigan are required or authorized by law or executive order to be closed. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date with respect to this Note will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the relevant record date for such interest installment, which shall be the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date (the Regular Record Date ). Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holders on such Regular Record Date, and may either be paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered Holders of the Notes not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. The principal of, and premium, if any, and the interest on the Notes shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered Holder at the close of business on the Regular Record Date at such address as shall appear in the Security Register. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, if this Note is a Global Note and is held in book-entry form through the facilities of the Depositary, payments on this Note will be made to the Depositary or its nominee in accordance with arrangements then in effect between the Trustee and the Depositary.

 This Note is not subject to repayment at the option of the Holder hereof. This Note is not subject to any sinking fund. 
 
 This Note will be redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (any such date of redemption to be a Redemption Date for purposes of the Indenture) on the terms and at the redemption prices set forth below. 
 
 A-2 

Prior to June 1, 2027 (the Par Call Date ), the Company may redeem this Note at its option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of 
 
 (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest hereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming this Note matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption, and 
 
 100 of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed, 
 
 plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest hereon to the redemption date. 
 
 On or after the Par Call Date, the Company may redeem this Note, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of this Note being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest hereon to the Redemption Date. 
 
 As used herein 
 
 Treasury Rate means, with respect to any redemption date, the yield determined by the Company in accordance with the following two paragraphs. 
 
 The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Company after 4 15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), on the third business day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as Selected Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15 (or any successor designation or publication) H.15 under the caption U.S. government securities Treasury constant maturities Nominal (or any successor caption or heading) H.15 TCM ). In determining the Treasury Rate, the Company shall select, as applicable 
 
 (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the Par Call Date (the Remaining Life or 
 
 (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life, the two yields one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life and shall interpolate to the Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places or 
 
 (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years, as applicable, of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date. 
 A-3 

If on the third business day preceding the redemption date H.15 TCM or any successor designation or publication is no longer published, the Company shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11 00 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on, or with a maturity that is closest to, the Par Call Date, as applicable. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date, the Company shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the Par Call Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, the Company shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11 00 a.m., New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11 00 a.m., New York City time, of such United States Treasury security, and rounded to three decimal places. 
 
 The Company s actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
 
 Notice of any optional redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to the Holder hereof at its registered address. 
 
 If money sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the principal amount of and accrued interest on the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed on the applicable Redemption Date is deposited with the Trustee or Paying Agent on or before the related Redemption Date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then on or after such Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the principal amount of this Note called for redemption. If the Notes are only partially redeemed by the Company, the Trustee shall select which Notes are to be redeemed by lot or in a manner it deems fair and appropriate in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. 
 
 In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the registered Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. 
 
 In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such registered Holder and upon all future registered Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange hereof or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. 
 
 No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time and place and at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.

No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto. 
 
 Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

In addition, if the 2024 Series F Redemption Date is prior to the 2024 Series F Par Call Date, each such notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of a senior financial officer of the Company as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such redemption (with the Reinvestment Yield calculated, solely for purposes of such estimate, using the relevant U.S. Treasury yield as of the second Business Day preceding the date of such notice), setting forth the details of such computation. The Make-Whole Amount shall be determined by the Company two Business Days prior to the applicable 2024 Series F Redemption Date and the Company shall deliver to holders of the 2024 Series F Bonds and to the Trustee a certificate of a senior financial officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the 2024 Series F Redemption Date.

Series F Redemption Date, and that such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so received on or before such date. 
 If the 2024 Series F Bonds are only partially redeemed by the Company, the Trustee shall select which 2024 Series F Bonds are to be redeemed pro rata among all of the 2024 Series F Bonds at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In the event of redemption of the 2024 Series F Bonds in part only, a new 2024 Series F Bond or 2024 Series F Bonds for the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name or names of the holders thereof upon the surrender or cancellation thereof.

As provided in the Indenture, the bonds may be issued thereunder for various principal sums and are issuable in series, which may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary as therein provided. The bonds represented by this certificate are part of a series designated 4.87 First Mortgage Bonds 2024 Series F (herein called the Bonds ), created by the Fifty-Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 1, 2024 as provided for in said Indenture.

Upon any such declaration, the Company shall also pay to the holders of the Bonds the Make-Whole Amount on the Bonds, if any, determined as of the date the Bonds shall have been declared due and payable. 
 No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, Make-Whole Amount, if any, or the interest on, the Bonds, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect of the Bonds or the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, director or officer, past, present or future, of the Company, as such, or any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any such predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability, whether at common law, in equity, by any constitution, statute or otherwise, of incorporators, stockholders, directors or officers being waived and released by the owner hereof by the acceptance of the Bonds, and as part of the consideration for the issue thereof, and being likewise waived and released pursuant to the Indenture.

 At any time prior to August 1, 2034 (the Par Call Date ), the Redemption Price will be equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed on the Redemption Date together with the Make-Whole Amount (as defined below), if any, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. 
 At any time on or after the Par Call Date, the Redemption Price will be equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed on the Redemption Date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. 
 
 10 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the Bonds that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Record Date. 
 Make-Whole Amount means, with respect to any Bond, a premium in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Bond over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. If the Settlement Date is prior to the Par Call Date, the Make-Whole Amount with respect to any Called Principal of a Bond shall be determined as if the Stated Maturity of such Bond were the Par Call Date provided that the Make-Whole Amount shall in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings 
 Called Principal means, with respect to a Bond, the principal of the Bond that is to be redeemed on a Redemption Date or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture, as the context requires. 
 Discounted Value means, with respect to the Called Principal of a Bond, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Bond is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal. 
 Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of a Bond, the sum of (a) 0.50 (50 basis points) plus (b) the yield to maturity implied by the Ask Yield(s) reported, as of 10 00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as Page PX-1 (or such other display as may replace Page PX-1), on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued, actively traded on-the-run, benchmark U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. 
 If there are no such U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between the Ask Yields Reported for the applicable most recently issued, actively traded on-the-run, U.S. Treasury securities with the maturities (1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than the Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Bond. If such yields are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), then Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Bond, the sum of (x) 0.50 (50 basis points) plus (y) the yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields 
 11 

reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there is no such U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Bond. 
 Remaining Average Life means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years, computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and calculated to two decimal places, that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the Stated Maturity (or, if redeemed prior to the Par Call Date, the Par Call Date) of such Remaining Scheduled Payment. 
 Remaining Scheduled Payments means, with respect to the Called Principal of a Bond, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its Stated Maturity (or, if redeemed prior to the Par Call Date, the Par Call Date), provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the Bond, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date. 
 Settlement Date means, with respect to the Called Principal of a Bond, the Redemption Date on which such Called Principal is to be redeemed or the date on which such Called Principal has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture as the context requires. 
 Notice of redemption shall be given to the holders of the Bonds to be redeemed not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, as provided in Section 4.05 of the Indenture. Each such notice shall specify such Redemption Date, the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed on such date, the principal amount of each Bond held by such holder to be redeemed, and the interest to be paid on the Redemption Date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid. In addition, if the Redemption Date is prior to the Par Call Date, each such notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of a senior financial officer of the Company as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such redemption (with the Reinvestment Yield calculated, solely for purposes of such estimate, using the relevant U.S. Treasury yield as of the second Business Day preceding the date of such notice), setting forth the details of such 
 12 

computation. The Make-Whole Amount shall be determined by the Company two Business Days prior to the applicable Redemption Date and the Company shall deliver to holders of the Bonds and to the Trustee a certificate of a senior financial officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the Redemption Date. 
 Subject to the limitations of Section 4.07 of the Indenture, the notice of redemption may state that it is subject to the receipt of the redemption moneys by the Trustee on or before the Redemption Date, and that such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so received on or before such date a notice of redemption so conditioned shall be of no force or effect if such money is not so received and, in such event, the Company shall not be required to redeem this Bond. 
 If the Bonds are only partially redeemed by the Company, the Trustee shall select which Bonds are to be redeemed pro rata among all of the Bonds at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In the event of redemption of the Bonds in part only, a new Bond or Bonds for the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name or names of the holders thereof upon the surrender or cancellation thereof. 
 If money sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Bonds to be redeemed on the applicable Redemption Date, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, is deposited with the Trustee on or before the related Redemption Date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then the Bonds to be redeemed shall no longer be secured by, or entitled to any lien or benefit of, the Indenture as provided by Section 4.04 of the Indenture. 
 The Indenture contains terms, provisions and conditions relating to the consolidation or merger of the Company with or into, and the conveyance, or other transfer or lease, subject to the lien of the Indenture, of the trust estate to, another corporation, to the assumption by such other corporation, in certain circumstances, of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture and on the Bonds and to the succession of such other corporation in certain circumstances, to the powers and rights of the Company under the Indenture. 
 The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of the Bonds or certain covenants with respect thereto upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein. 
 This Bond shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose unless and until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been manually executed by the Trustee or its successor in trust under the Indenture. 
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, DTE GAS COMPANY has caused this certificate to be executed under its name with the signature of its duly authorized Officer, under its corporate seal, which may be a facsimile, attested with the signature of its Corporate Secretary.

 The bonds represented by this certificate, of the series hereinafter specified, are bonds of the Company (herein called the bonds known as its First Mortgage Bonds, issued and to be issued in one or more series under, and all equally and ratably secured by, an Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated as of March 1, 1944, duly executed by the Company to Citibank, N.A., successor trustee Trustee ), as restated in Part II of the Twenty-ninth Supplemental Indenture dated as of July 15, 1989, which became effective on April 1, 1994, to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto executed on and after July 15, 1989 reference is hereby made for a description of the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security,

the terms and conditions upon which the bonds are, and are to be, issued and secured, and the rights of the holders of the bonds and of the Trustee in respect of such security (which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, including the Fifty-Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 1, 2024 referred to below, are hereinafter collectively called the Indenture ). As provided in the Indenture, the bonds may be issued thereunder for various principal sums and are issuable in series, which may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary as therein provided. The bonds represented by this certificate are part of a series designated 5.43 First Mortgage Bonds 2024 Series G (herein called the Bonds ), created by the Fifty-Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 1, 2024 as provided for in said Indenture. 
 With the consent of the Company and to the extent permitted by and as provided in the Indenture, the rights and obligations of the Company, the rights and obligations of the holders of the Bonds, and the terms and provisions of the Indenture may be modified or altered by such affirmative vote or votes of the holders of the Bonds then outstanding as are specified in the Indenture. 
 In case an Event of Default as defined in the Indenture shall occur, the principal of the Bonds may become or be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect, and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. Upon any such declaration, the Company shall also pay to the holders of the Bonds the Make-Whole Amount on the Bonds, if any, determined as of the date the Bonds shall have been declared due and payable. 
 No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, Make-Whole Amount, if any, or the interest on, the Bonds, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect of the Bonds or the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, director or officer, past, present or future, of the Company, as such, or any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any such predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability, whether at common law, in equity, by any constitution, statute or otherwise, of incorporators, stockholders, directors or officers being waived and released by the owner hereof by the acceptance of the Bonds, and as part of the consideration for the issue thereof, and being likewise waived and released pursuant to the Indenture. 
 This Bond shall be subject to redemption at the option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (any such date of optional redemption, a Redemption Date ), at the applicable redemption price Redemption Price set forth below. 
 At any time prior to May 1, 2054 (the Par Call Date ), the Redemption Price will be equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed on the Redemption Date together with the Make-Whole Amount (as defined below), if any, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. 
 
 21 

At any time on or after the Par Call Date, the Redemption Price will be equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed on the Redemption Date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the Bonds that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Record Date. 
 Make-Whole Amount means, with respect to any Bond, a premium in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Bond over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. If the Settlement Date is prior to the Par Call Date, the Make-Whole Amount with respect to any Called Principal of a Bond shall be determined as if the Stated Maturity of such Bond were the Par Call Date provided that the Make-Whole Amount shall in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings 
 Called Principal means, with respect to a Bond, the principal of the Bond that is to be redeemed on a Redemption Date or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture, as the context requires. 
 Discounted Value means, with respect to the Called Principal of a Bond, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Bond is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal. 
 Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of a Bond, the sum of (a) 0.50 (50 basis points) plus (b) the yield to maturity implied by the Ask Yield(s) reported, as of 10 00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as Page PX-1 (or such other display as may replace Page PX-1), on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued, actively traded on-the-run, benchmark U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. 
 If there are no such U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between the Ask Yields Reported for the applicable most recently issued, actively traded on-the-run, U.S. Treasury securities with the maturities (1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than the Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears 
 22 

in the interest rate of the applicable Bond. If such yields are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), then Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Bond, the sum of (x) 0.50 (50 basis points) plus (y) the yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there is no such U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Bond. 
 Remaining Average Life means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years, computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and calculated to two decimal places, that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the Stated Maturity (or, if redeemed prior to the Par Call Date, the Par Call Date) of such Remaining Scheduled Payment. 
 Remaining Scheduled Payments means, with respect to the Called Principal of a Bond, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its Stated Maturity (or, if redeemed prior to the Par Call Date, the Par Call Date), provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the Bond, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date. 
 Settlement Date means, with respect to the Called Principal of a Bond, the Redemption Date on which such Called Principal is to be redeemed or the date on which such Called Principal has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture as the context requires. 
 Notice of redemption shall be given to the holders of the Bonds to be redeemed not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, as provided in Section 4.05 of the Indenture. Each such notice shall specify such Redemption Date, the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed on such date, the principal amount of each Bond held by such holder to be redeemed, and the interest to be paid on the Redemption Date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid. In addition, if the Redemption Date is prior to the Par Call Date, each such 
 23 

notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of a senior financial officer of the Company as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such redemption (with the Reinvestment Yield calculated, solely for purposes of such estimate, using the relevant U.S. Treasury yield as of the second Business Day preceding the date of such notice), setting forth the details of such computation. The Make-Whole Amount shall be determined by the Company two Business Days prior to the applicable Redemption Date and the Company shall deliver to holders of the Bonds and to the Trustee a certificate of a senior financial officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the Redemption Date. 
 Subject to the limitations of Section 4.07 of the Indenture, the notice of redemption may state that it is subject to the receipt of the redemption moneys by the Trustee on or before the Redemption Date, and that such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so received on or before such date a notice of redemption so conditioned shall be of no force or effect if such money is not so received and, in such event, the Company shall not be required to redeem this Bond. 
 If the Bonds are only partially redeemed by the Company, the Trustee shall select which Bonds are to be redeemed pro rata among all of the Bonds at the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In the event of redemption of the Bonds in part only, a new Bond or Bonds for the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name or names of the holders thereof upon the surrender or cancellation thereof. 
 If money sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Bonds to be redeemed on the applicable Redemption Date, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date, is deposited with the Trustee on or before the related Redemption Date and certain other conditions are satisfied, then the Bonds to be redeemed shall no longer be secured by, or entitled to any lien or benefit of, the Indenture as provided by Section 4.04 of the Indenture. 
 The Indenture contains terms, provisions and conditions relating to the consolidation or merger of the Company with or into, and the conveyance, or other transfer or lease, subject to the lien of the Indenture, of the trust estate to, another corporation, to the assumption by such other corporation, in certain circumstances, of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture and on the Bonds and to the succession of such other corporation in certain circumstances, to the powers and rights of the Company under the Indenture. 
 The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of the Bonds or certain covenants with respect thereto upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein. 
 This Bond shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose unless and until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been manually executed by the Trustee or its successor in trust under the Indenture.
