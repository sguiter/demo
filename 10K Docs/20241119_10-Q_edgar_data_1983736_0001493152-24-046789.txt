of Impact Future Media LLC and its media and entertainment assets. The Company announced the closing of this transaction on March 25,
2014. From March 2014 to September 28, 2021, the Company was involved in the entertainment, publishing, and interactive industry. 

The
Company s year-end is December 31. 

Current Operations 

From September 28, 2021, the Company operates
at the junction of digital marketing and media monetization. We enable market awareness of companies and brands by providing best-in-class
digital marketing and monetization services on the Internet. Our typical customers are advertising agencies (classified under SIC7319)
and businesses in various industries seeking to market their products and services using our platform, including media companies, financial
institutions, and other retail entities. Most of our customers are from North America, mainly the US and Canada. For the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2023, we had nineteen (19) customers, primarily from North America, compared to seven (7) customers for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2022. The top three customers represent and of revenue for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023,
and 2022. Our company s financial health is highly dependent on these top customers. If any of them were to significantly reduce
their spending or cease doing business with your company, it could have a major impact on your revenue and overall financial health.
Such customers advertise with media through us and engage in media buying services such as online traffic from the Eva Platform. We also
deal with businesses (as described under NAICS 541810) that utilize our in-house digital marketing capabilities, including advice, creative
services, account management, production of advertising material, media planning, and buying (i.e., placing advertising). 

We execute our business through Eva Platform based
on Artificial Intelligence, or AI, to match advertising campaigns to specific ad spots one at a time. Our system creates conversion mapping
tables that allow us to increase conversion rates by analyzing those trends with optimized historical conversion rates and further capitalizing
on and improving those rates. We leverage big data, an accumulation of too large and complex data for traditional database
management tools to process. Since more companies are attempting to leverage big data to make strategic business decisions, we have built
automated tools that analyze the data and feed the relevant information into our decision logic. We have designed our solution to optimize
brand campaigns to create brand awareness and direct response campaigns with a fixed conversion point. 

In November 2020, the Company completed the development
of the Eva XML Platform, where the Platform buys traffic from various sources and sells that traffic to landing pages that display advertising
via XML feeds. A price discrepancy exists between buying traffic on display and native platforms for specific keywords in an ad campaign
and the XML search feeds. The Eval XML Platform manages the entire ad buying/selling process by integrating into Google, Microsoft, Taboola,
Revcontent, Gemini, and Facebook. The Eva XML Platform creates thousands of ads with the push of a button. The Eva XML Platform manages
the spending depending on the performance of keywords in the ad campaign to maximize the arbitrage revenue. 

The Company earns revenues from advertisers by
signing purchase or insertion orders based on Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less,
Version 3.0, as defined in 4 s/IAB. We intend to offer media companies and advertising agencies a standard for conducting business
acceptable to both parties based on such terms and conditions. When incorporated into an insertion order, this protocol represents the
Company and its customers shared understanding of doing business. The Company may also sign additional documents to cover sponsorships
and other arrangements involving content association, integration, and special production. The Company considers an insertion order with
its customers, a binding contract with the customer, or other similar documentation reflecting the terms and conditions under which it
provides products or services. As a result, the Company considers the insertion order persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Each insertion
is specific to the customer, defines each party s fee schedule, duties, and responsibilities, and is governed by 4 s/IAB
Version 3.0 for renewal and termination terms, confidentiality agreement, dispute resolution, and other clauses necessary for such contract. 

Russia
 Ukraine Conflict 

The
geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified on February 24, 2022, with Russia s invasion of Ukraine. The war between the
two countries continues to evolve as military activity continues. The United States and certain European countries have imposed additional
sanctions on Russia and specific individuals. The Company has no operation exposure in the region affected by war. As of the date of
this report, there has been no disruption in our operations.

We
have determined the method of accounting for the reverse acquisition guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 ). 

We
prepared the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, following a reverse acquisition under Eva
Live Inc. (accounting acquiree), but as a continuation of the financial statements of EvaMedia (accounting acquirer). We have made one
adjustment: retroactively adjusting EvaMedia s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the Company. We calculated the adjustment
based on the share exchange ratio of one new share of Company common stock for every share of EvaMedia capital stock previously issued
and outstanding. Comparative information preserved in these consolidated financial statements is also retroactively adjusted to reflect
the legal capital of the Company. The legal capital on December 31, 2023, reflects the legal capital of the Company after the Acquisition
date and therefore requires no adjustment. 

NOTE
1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Restatement 

Reverse
 Capitalization 

After SEC s order on BF Borgers CPA in May 2024, the Company reevaluated
the significant transaction as reverse capitalization instead of a reverse acquisition. On September 28, 2021 (the Acquisition
Date ), the Company entered a reverse capitalization transaction (Acquisition) with EvaMedia Corp. (EvaMedia). As per SEC 7050 
Reverse Mergers, A reverse recapitalization is a transaction in which a shell company (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2) issues its
equity interests to effect the acquisition of an operating company. Reverse recapitalization is accounted for as a capital transaction
equivalent to the operating company (i.e., the accounting acquirer, EvaMedia) issuing its equity for the net assets of the shell company
(the Company), followed by recapitalization. A reverse recapitalization is not accounted for as a business combination because the shell
company is not a business. Since reverse recapitalization is not accounted for as a business combination, goodwill would be recorded
because of the reverse recapitalization transaction. Therefore, we have eliminated goodwill of as of September 30, 2023. Rather, any excess of the fair value of the shares
issued by the operating company over the value of the net monetary assets of the shell company is recognized as a reduction to equity.
In a reverse recapitalization, the legal acquirer/issuer is a shell company, the Company.

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

Our
typical customers are advertising agencies classified under SIC7319, which advertise with media but perform no creative services (media
buying services such as online traffic from EvaMedia). We also deal with businesses (as described under NAICS 541810) organized to provide
a full range of services (i.e., through in-house capabilities or subcontracting), including advice, creative services, account management,
production of advertising material, media planning, and buying (i.e., advertising). 

The
Company earns revenues from advertisers by signing purchase or the insertion orders based on Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet
Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less, Version 3.0, as defined in 4 s/IAB. Such terms and conditions are intended to offer
media companies and advertising agencies an acceptable standard for conducting business for both parties. When incorporated into an insertion
order, this protocol represents the Company and its customers shared understanding of doing business. The Company may also sign
additional documents to cover sponsorships and other arrangements involving content association, integration, and special production.
The Company considers an insertion order with its customers, a binding contract with the customer, or other similar documentation reflecting
the terms and conditions under which it provides products or services. As a result, the Company considers the insertion order persuasive
evidence of an arrangement. Each insertion is specific to the customer, defines each party s fee schedule, duties, and responsibilities,
and is governed by 4 s/IAB Version 3.0 for renewal and termination terms, confidentiality agreement, dispute resolution, and other
clauses necessary for such contract. 

The
Company adopted ASU 2014-09 Revenue for insertion/purchase orders, or contract(s) (from now known as contracts received
from customers. 

The
Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services as per the contract with the customer. As a result, the Company
accounts for revenue contracts with customers by applying the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which includes the following steps: 

Identify
 the contract(s) and subsequent amendments with the customer. 

Identify
 all the performance obligations in the contract and subsequent amendments. 

Determine
 the transaction price for completing performance obligations. 

Allocate
 the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 

Recognize
 the revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. 

The
Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018. The Company
presents results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018, under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are reported following
legacy GAAP. In addition to the above guidelines, the Company also considers implementation guidance on warranties, customer options,
licensing, and other topics. The Company considers revenue collectability, methods for measuring progress toward complete satisfaction
of a performance obligation, warranties, customer options for additional goods or services, non-refundable upfront fees, licensing, customer
acceptance, and other relevant categories. 

The
Company accounts for a contract when the Company and the customer parties have approved the contract and are committed
to performing their respective obligations, where each party can identify their rights, obligations, and payment terms; the contract
has commercial substance. The Company will probably collect all of the consideration substantially. Revenue is recognized when performance
obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the promised service to a customer. The Company fixes the transaction price for
goods and services at contract inception. The Company s standard payment terms are generally net 30 days and, in some cases, due
upon receipt of the invoice. 

The
Company considers contract modification as a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract that the parties approve. The parties
describe contract modification as a change order, a variation, or an amendment. A contract modification exists when the parties to the
contract approve a modification that either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations of the parties to the
contract. The Company assumes a contract modification when approved in writing, by oral agreement, or implied by the customary business
practice of the customer. If the parties to the contract have not agreed on a contract modification, the Company continues to apply the
guidance to the existing contract until the contract modification is approved. The Company recognizes contract modification in various
forms including but not limited to partial termination, an extension of the contract term with a corresponding price increase,
adding new goods and services to the contract, with or without a corresponding price change, and reducing the contract price without
a change in goods or services promised. 

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

For
all its goods and services, at contract inception, the Company assesses the solutions or services, or bundles of solutions and services,
obligated in the contract with a customer to identify each performance obligation within the contract and then evaluate whether the performance
obligations are capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. Solutions and services that are not capable
of being distinct and distinct within the context of the agreement are combined and treated as a single performance obligation in determining
the allocation and recognition of revenue. For multi-element transactions, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance
obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company determines the standalone selling price for each item at the transaction s
inception involving these multiple elements. 

Performance

 The
 Company sets up the advertising campaign on Eva s demand-side Platform. It specifies types of ads (banner, search, video, etc.),
 place of the campaign (Website, mobile, or ad networks), and target of the ads (demographics, interests, etc.). 
 
 The
 Company recognizes the consulting revenues when the customer receives services over the length of the contract. If the customer pays
 the Company in advance for these services, the Company records such payment as deferred revenue until the Company completes the services. 

The
Company assumes that the goods or services promised in the existing contract will be transferred to the customer to determine the transaction
price. The Company believes the agreement will not be canceled, renewed, or modified; therefore, the transaction price includes only
those the Company has rights to under the present contract. For example, suppose the Company agrees with a customer with an original
term of one year and expects the customer to renew for a second year. In that case, the Company will determine the transaction price
based on the initial one-year period. When choosing the transaction price, the Company first identifies the fixed consideration, including
non-refundable upfront payment amounts. 

To
allocate the transaction price, the Company allocates an amount that best represents the consideration the entity expects to receive
for transferring each promised good or service to the customer. To meet the allocation objective, the Company allocates the transaction
price to each performance obligation identified in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. In determining the standalone
selling price, the Company uses the best evidence of the standalone selling price that the Company charges to similar customers in similar
circumstances. The Company sometimes uses the adjusted market assessment approach to determine the standalone selling price. It evaluates
the market in which it sells the goods or services and estimates the price customers would pay for those goods or services when sold
separately. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when or as it transfers the promised goods or services in the contract. The Company considers the transfers 
of the promised goods or services when the customer obtains control of the goods or services. The Company believes a customer obtains
control of an asset when, or as, it can directly use and obtain all the remaining benefits from the asset substantially. The Company
recognizes deferred revenue related to services it will deliver within one year as a current liability. The Company presents deferred
revenue related to services that the Company will provide more than one year into the future as a non-current liability.

Current
Operations 

As
of September 28, 2021, the Company s vision is to build the world s leading digital media platform to deliver measurable
business outcomes at a scale for regional and global brands, agencies, and retailers across different marketing goals. Our system continually
learns to achieve trusted and impactful digital advertising solutions, eliminating ad fraud, lag, and error to produce unmatched digital
advertising optimization. Effective September 28, 2021, David Boulette is the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Director. At
present, the Company currently has four directors. The one non-executive director is Terry Fields. The three executive directors are
David Boulette, Phil Aspin, and Daryl Walser. 

Eva
Live is a technology company that has developed an automated and intelligent advertiser campaign management platform, Eva Platform. Our
Platform enables advertisers customers, clients to buy advertising space on several digital channels to reach their desired
audience. Our technology intends to address the needs of markets where high-volume advertisers want automated advertising purchases to
have high conversion rates. We focus on data-driven marketing and cross-channel measurement, critical to businesses looking to optimize
their marketing budget and reach audiences across all their integrated advertising efforts. 

We
operate at the junction of digital marketing and media monetization. We enable market awareness of companies and brands by providing
best-in-class digital marketing and monetization services on the Internet. Our typical customers are advertising agencies (classified
under SIC7319) and businesses in various industries seeking to market their products and services using our platform, including media
companies, financial institutions, and other retail entities. Most of our customers are from North America, mainly the US and Canada. 

For
the three months ending September 30, 2024, we had nine (9) customers, primarily from North America, compared to seven (7) customers
for the previous period ending September 30, 2023. The top three customers represent over 83 and 70 of revenue for the three months
ending September 30, 2024, and 2023. Our company s financial health is highly dependent on these top customers. If any of them
were to significantly reduce their spending or cease doing business with your company, it could have a major impact on your revenue and
overall financial health. Such customers advertise with media through us and engage in media buying services such as online traffic from
the Eva Platform. We also deal with businesses (as described under NAICS 541810) that utilize our in-house digital marketing capabilities,
including advice, creative services, account management, production of advertising material, media planning, and buying (i.e., placing
advertising). 

2 

We
execute our business through Eva Platform based on Artificial Intelligence, or AI, to match advertising campaigns to specific ad spots
one at a time. Our system creates conversion mapping tables that allow us to increase conversion rates by analyzing those trends with
optimized historical conversion rates and further capitalizing on and improving those rates. We leverage big data, an accumulation
of data that is too large and complex for processing by traditional database management tools. Since more companies are attempting to
leverage big data to make strategic business decisions, we have built automated tools that analyze the data and feed the relevant information
into our decision logic. We have designed our solution to optimize brand campaigns to create awareness and direct response campaigns
with a fixed conversion point. 

The
Company also owns the Eva XML Platform, which buys traffic from various sources and sells that traffic to landing pages that display
advertising via XML feeds. A price discrepancy exists between buying traffic on display and native platforms for specific keywords in
an ad campaign and the XML search feeds. The Eval XML Platform manages the entire ad buying/selling process by integrating into Google,
Microsoft, Taboola, Revcontent, Gemini, and Facebook. As a result, we can create thousands of ads with a push of a button. The Eva XML
Platform manages the spending depending on the performance of keywords in the ad campaign to maximize the arbitrage revenue. 

Recent
Significant Transaction 

EvaMedia
Corp. Acquisition (Reverse Acquisition) 

On
September 28, 2021 (the Acquisition Date ), the Company merged Acquisition into EvaMedia Corp. EvaMedia).
Upon completion of the Acquisition, the Company acquired all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of EvaMedia. As a result,
the Company issued 110,192,177 shares of the Company s common stock to shareholders of EvaMedia, and immediately following the
Acquisition, 111,169,525 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. As a result, EvaMedia s shareholders control 99.12 
of issued and outstanding shares of the Company on a fully diluted basis. Following the Acquisition, David Boulette of EvaMedia became
the company s CEO, director, and controlling shareholder. He appointed two additional board members from EvaMedia, Phil Aspin and
Darly Walser. Terry Fields remained the only board member from the Company. 

We
have accounted the Acquisition as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting per ASC 805, with EvaMedia treated
as the accounting acquirer and the Company treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. We determine
EvaMedia an accounting acquirer based on the following facts: (i) after the reverse merger, former shareholders of EvaMedia held a majority
of the voting interest of the combined company; (ii) former Board of Directors of EvaMedia possess majority control of the Board of Directors
of the combined company; (iii) members of the management of EvaMedia are responsible for the management of the combined company. As such,
we have treated the financial statements of EvaMedia as the historical financial statements of the combined company, and (iv) EvaMedia s
relative size measured in assets and revenues is significantly larger than that of the Company. 

We
have identified the Company as the legal acquirer, as it is the entity that issued securities. Comparatively, we have identified EvaMedia
as the legal acquiree, the entity whose equity interests are acquired. 

We
consider the Acquisition a reverse acquisition; therefore, the purchase consideration is the Company s fair value as of September
28, 2021. The number of shares issued and outstanding for the Company just before the Acquisition Date was 977,348, with a market price
of 2.000 quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the trading symbol GOAI. We estimated the purchase price and the book value or net financial
liability of the Company to be 1,954,697 and 55,909. As a result, we recorded Goodwill as the difference between the purchase price
and book value, 2,010,606. The Company carried out the Goodwill Impairment Analysis as of December 31, 2021, where the carrying value
of Goodwill as of December 31, 2021, is 2,010,606 (See Reverse Capitalization). The fair market value of the implied Goodwill is approximately
 37,772,765, which is higher than the carrying value, and thus, the Company did not record any impairment as of December 31, 2023. Factors
that might lead a company to perform more frequent impairment tests include economic downturns, poor operational results, lower market
capitalization, or other market and industry changes that could reduce the fair value of the reporting units or the intangible assets.
We opted not to perform impairment tests as such factors do not impact our business during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Reverse
Capitalization 

After
SEC s order on BF Borgers CPA in May 2024, the Company reevaluated the significant transaction as reverse capitalization instead
of a reverse acquisition. On September 28, 2021 (the Acquisition Date ), the Company entered a reverse capitalization transaction
(Acquisition) with EvaMedia Corp. EvaMedia). As per SEC 7050 Reverse Mergers, A reverse recapitalization is a transaction
in which a shell company (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2) issues its equity interests to effect the acquisition of an operating
company. Reverse recapitalization is accounted for as a capital transaction equivalent to the operating company (i.e., the accounting
acquirer, EvaMedia) issuing its equity for the net assets of the shell company (the Company) followed by a recapitalization. A reverse
recapitalization is not accounted for as a business combination because the shell company is not a business. Since a reverse recapitalization
is not accounted for as a business combination, there would not be any goodwill recorded because of the reverse recapitalization transaction.
Therefore, we have eliminated goodwill of 2,010,606 as of September 30, 2024. Rather, any excess of the fair value of the shares issued
by the operating company over the value of the net monetary assets of the shell company is recognized as a reduction to equity. In a
reverse recapitalization the legal acquirer/issuer is a shell company, the Company. 

AdFlare
Acquisition 

On
July 13, 2022, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement AdFlare SEA with AdFlare Limited, a company duly formed
under the laws of Ireland (Reg. Number: 714192) AdFlare ), and the shareholders of AdFlare, Phil Aspin, an individual and
Stephen Adds, an individual (collectively, the Shareholders whereby the Company acquired One Hundred (100 percent of
the issued and outstanding shares of AdFlare in exchange for 500,000 shares of the Company s restricted common stock valued at
 1,500,000 using the discounted cash flow methodology. Mr. Phil Aspin, co-founder of AdFlare, has been a member of the Company s
Board of Directors since September 28, 2021. The Company carried out the Goodwill Impairment Analysis as of December 31, 2023, where
the carrying value of the Goodwill as of December 31, 2022, is 1,500,000. The fair market value of the implied Goodwill is approximately
 0, which is less than the carrying value, and thus, the impairment as of December 31, 2022, is 1,500,000. 

AdFlare,
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a leader in the specialized field of Header Bidding, with a deep contextual
understanding of an array of ad technologies spanning search, display, and video across mobile and desktop, providing solutions to help
all publishers drive revenue. Header bidding, also known as advance or pre-bidding, is a technology wherein publishers simultaneously
offer their inventory to multiple ad exchanges, advertisers, and agencies. The idea is that by letting various buyers bid on the same
inventory at the same time, in real-time, there s more competition driving up the auction pressure and a chance to serve each impression
at a higher Cost Per Mille rate CPM rate ), meaning capturing additional revenue. AdFlare has a track record of delivering
over 1 billion ad impressions a month and increasing Google AdX over Google AdSense CPM by over 30 , with an average fill rate of 99.9 
in the US market.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At
September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had 849,263 and 472,509 cash to execute its business plan. At September 30, 2024,
and December 31, 2023, the Company had accumulated a deficit of 29,824,798 and 24,176,091. The Company had a working capital surplus
and deficit of 140,663 and 61,141 on September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 

Since
its inception, the Company has sustained losses and negative cash flows from operations. The Management believes that cash on hand may
not be sufficient for the Company to meet working capital and corporate development needs as they become due in the ordinary course of
business for twelve (12) months following September 30, 2024. The Company had not generated significant revenues or cash flow from operations
in the past and for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations
and the ongoing requirement for substantial additional capital investment to develop its financial technologies. We expect to conduct
the planned operations for twelve months using currently available capital resources. The Management anticipates raising significant
additional capital to accomplish its growth plan over twelve (12) months. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new funding
sources. The Management expects to seek additional funding through private equity or public markets. However, there can be no assurance
about the availability or terms such as financing and capital might be available. 

In
the next twelve months, the Company will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support, development of technology solutions,
and enhancement of existing technology to serve our customers. We expect capital expenditure to increase to up to 250,000 in the next
twelve months to support the growth, which mainly includes software development, acquisition of complementary software, and purchasing
of computers and servers. In addition, the Company estimates the additional expenditure needed to be 250,000, which provides 100,000
and 1500,000 for sales marketing and working capital, respectively. 

5 

For
the next six to nine months, we expect existing cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and access to funding to be sufficient to fund
our operating activities and other cash commitments, such as related party payments and material capital expenditures. However, we may
need additional funds to achieve sustainable sales where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that
any additional financing will be available or, if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. 

GOING
CONCERN CONSIDERATION 

We
have yet to generate significant revenues and cash flow from operations to cover our ongoing expenses. As of September 30, 2024, the
Company had an accumulated deficit of 29,824,798. Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the
audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, regarding concerns about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that led to this disclosure
by our independent auditors. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification
of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. 

Management
has considered various factors in evaluating the Company s sustainability and the ability to manage obligations due within a year.
Management has considered general economic conditions, key industry metrics, operating results, capital expenditure, commitments, future
obligations, and liquidity. If there is a delay in generating significant revenues by December 31, 2023, the Company will require capital
infusion from new and existing investors, streamlining operating costs, and evaluating new business strategies to enhance cash flow from
operations. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES 

We
have based our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements,
which we have prepared following the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we are required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material and uncertain in the current economic environment
due to COVID-19. 

In
more detail, we have described significant accounting policies in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on October 27, 2023. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments
required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions. 

JOBS
ACT ACCOUNTING ELECTION 

We
are an emerging growth company , as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay
adopting new or revised accounting standards issued after the enactment of the JOBS Act until those standards apply to private companies.
As an emerging growth company, we have applied for an exemption; as a result, the Company may delay the adoption of certain accounting
standards until the standards apply to private companies. 

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 

We
have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(c) of the SEC s Regulation S-B. We did not have any
relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that
would have been established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

The
amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption
of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued.
We have adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2020, for ASC 606, Revenue Recognition and Amended ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 840). The ASU
is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we have described significant accounting
policies in more details in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our S-1/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023,
filed with the SEC on October 27, 2023, we believe the accounting policies as described in Note 2 to be critical to the judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.

ITEM

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (together,
the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-
15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of our company, 

(2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
and directors, and 

(3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets
that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness in future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. Based on our assessments,
management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, due to the
material weakness in our internal controls due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel
and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping. 

Management
intends to implement remediation steps to improve our internal controls due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes
due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping.
We plan to further improve this process by enhancing the size and composition of our board upon the closing of the business identifying
third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications, and consideration of additional staff with
the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals and implemented additional layers of reviews in
the internal controls and financial reporting process. 

This
Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth
company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
