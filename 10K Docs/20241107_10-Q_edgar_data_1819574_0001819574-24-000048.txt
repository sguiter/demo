 alleged shareholders filed a putative class action complaint in the lawsuit styled Kenville v. Northern Star Sponsor LLC, et al., Case No. 2024-276, which is pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On September 30, 2024, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint is brought against (a) certain officers and directors of Northern Star Acquisition Corp. at the time of its proposed acquisition of Legacy BARK, (b) Northern Star Sponsor, LLC, (c) of the founders of Legacy BARK, and (d) the Company. The alleged class consists of Company stockholders who held stock as of the redemption deadline and who elected not to redeem all or some of their stock, and the claims alleged are for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. At this time, the Company is not able to quantify any potential liability in connection with this litigation because the case is in its early stages.

reportable segments: Direct to Consumer and Commerce. The Direct to Consumer segment derives revenue from the sale of toys accessories and consumables through BarkBox, Super Chewer, and the Company s consumables website, bark.co. This segment also includes revenue derived from BARK Air. The Commerce segment derives revenue primarily from the sale of individual toys through major retailers and online marketplaces. The Company recently began selling treats through certain retail partners. Reporting in this format provides management with the financial information necessary to evaluate the success of the segments and the overall business. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company s segment. 
 The Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker CODM reviews revenue and gross profit for both of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue incurred by the segment. The Company does not allocate assets at the reportable segment level as these are managed on an entity wide group basis and, accordingly, the Company does not report asset information by segments.

 Overview 
 We believe that dogs and humans are better together and we aspire to be the world s favorite dog brand. We are a team of dog-obsessed people committed to delivering personalization at scale by satisfying each dog s distinct personality, preferences, and needs with the best products and services. Since our founding in 2011, we have happily served millions of dogs and their people. 
 We are a vertically integrated, omnichannel brand serving dogs across two key categories: toys accessories and consumables. All of our products are designed, developed, and branded BARK. We leverage an ever-growing collection of first-party data, customer insights, and machine learning to deliver personalized products and experiences tailored to the needs of each and every dog we serve. Our products are sold direct-to-consumer and through our network of retail partners, which currently spans over 40,000 doors across the U.S. 
 We began our journey with BarkBox a monthly-themed subscription of toys and treats, tailored to the needs of each customer based on their dog s size, play style, allergies, and more. By viewing each dog as an individual, and by creating magical experiences for our customers, we have been able to build lasting relationships with millions of dogs and their parents. Our customer service Happy Team proactively engages around 200,000 customers each month. We use the valuable data from these customer interactions to inform the design and development of future products, and we leverage it along with machine learning technology to recommend additional products to our customers through cross-selling and Add-to-Box ATB ). 
 More recently, we have entered exciting, and much larger categories in the consumables space, which include kibble, treats, toppers, supplements, and dental products. This expansion has significantly increased our total addressable market and the number of customers we can serve. We believe that our growing first-party dataset, strong brand, and loyal customer base afford us a meaningful advantage and opportunity to win market share in these newer categories. 
 
 Certain macroeconomic and global events, conditions and challenges 
 In the past, we have experienced increases in inbound freight costs due to the challenges in the import market, as transpacific ships and trade lanes were overburdened with volume and experienced a significant shortage of equipment and capacity due to macroeconomic challenges affecting the global supply chain, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and wars, armed conflicts or rising geopolitical tensions. Increases in freight costs and supply chain disruptions that would impact our business could be created or driven by market factors or international events, such as a global pandemic or other disruptions or disasters, severe weather events, inflation, war in the Middle East and the Ukraine and rising tensions between the U.S. and China. 
 Macroeconomic conditions and the related effects on levels of consumer spending impact our business as purchases of discretionary items tend to decline when disposable income is lower or when there are recessions, inflationary pressures or other economic uncertainty. Inflation, rising interest rates, higher fuel and energy costs and 
 19 

commodity prices, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home prices, credit availability and consumer debt levels, political instability due to war or other geopolitical factors and other macroeconomic pressures and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment have led to recession fears and created a challenging environment. 
 We cannot predict the duration or magnitude of such impacts. Please refer to the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and the Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Key Performance Indicators 
 We use the following key financial and operating metrics to evaluate our business and operations, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, project our future performance, and make strategic decisions. These key financial and operating metrics should be read in conjunction with the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Total Orders 
 We define Total Orders as the total number of Direct to Consumer orders shipped in a given period. These include all orders across all of our product categories, regardless of whether they are purchased on a subscription, auto-ship, or one-off basis. Total Orders excludes orders from BARK Air. 
 Average Order Value 
 Average Order Value AOV is Direct to Consumer revenue for the period divided by Total Orders for the same period. AOV excludes Direct to Consumer revenue from BARK Air. 
 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 We operate with two reportable segments: Direct to Consumer and Commerce, to reflect the way our Chief Executive Officer, who is our CODM, reviews and assesses the performance of the business. 
 Revenue 
 The Company generates revenue through its Direct to Consumer and Commerce segments, each of which participate in the sale of the Company s Toys Accessories and Consumables product lines. See below for additional information. 
 Toys Accessories toys The majority of our revenue in the toys category is derived from BarkBox and Super Chewer, which are subscription products that feature monthly themed boxes of premium-quality BARK toys and treats that are delivered directly to a dog s home. Customers have the option to subscribe to these products on a monthly, six month, or annual basis. Subscription revenue is recognized at a point in time as control is transferred to the subscriber upon delivery of each monthly box. During the life of their subscription, we offer customers incremental products via Add to Box ATB ), which enables us to cross-sell customers into our full portfolio of 
 20 

products, including kibble, treats, toppers, dental and more. ATB revenue is recognized at a point in time as control is transferred to the customer upon delivery of goods to the subscriber. 
 We also sell toys through our Commerce segment which is a network of retail partners and online major market places. This distribution channel allows us to reach new customers and introduce them to the BARK brand. Commerce revenue derived from our retail partners is recognized net of estimates for sales returns, discounts, markdowns and allowances, after the goods are shipped, or when the retail customer picks up the goods directly from one of our distribution points and control of the goods is transferred to the customer. Online marketplaces revenue is recognized upon delivery of goods to the end customer. 
 Our toys category also includes revenue derived from the sale of other products such as beds, leashes, apparel, and other miscellaneous products. 
 Consumables The majority of our consumables revenue today is derived from the treats and chews that are included in our BarkBox and Super Chewer boxes. Over the past two years, the Company has expanded into new and larger consumables markets such as kibble, toppers, supplements and dental products. The Company primarily sells these products via its website at bark.co, all of which can be purchased on a recurring, auto-ship, or one-off basis. Revenue related to bark.co is recognized at a point in time, as control is transferred to the customer upon each delivery. 
 Treats Includes treats and chews included in our BarkBox and Super Chewer boxes, as well as the sale of treats on our consumables website. Many of our treats feature monthly themes, similar to our toys. Today, BARK is one of the largest treat brands in the U.S. by revenue. The Company recently began selling its new line of treats in 2,400 Target and PetSmart doors nationwide, and expects to further expansion of consumables in retail in the future. 
 Toppers Includes meal-enhancing sprinkles, broths and bites that are added to a dog s food to enhance the flavor of their food. These toppers are often single ingredient proteins that can be easily added to a dog s existing meal plan. Toppers are particularly beneficial for picky eaters. 
 Supplements Includes a variety of dog supplements such as hip and joint support, and skin and coat support. These products are often targeted at specific breeds that are prone to certain ailments. 
 Kibble We sell a variety of kibble, priced to compete with the mass premium category. While our kibble can be purchased on an individual basis, we entered this market with a breed-based approach that recommends meal plans consisting of a mix of kibble, toppers, and supplements based on the characteristics and personalities of various dog breeds. For example, because German Shepherds are prone to hip issues, we recommend hip and joint support supplements with the purchase of their kibble. If that dog is also a picky eater, we will recommend adding one of our toppers. This enhances our average order value and margin profile. 
 Dental Also known as BARK Bright, this category includes a variety of chews and toothpastes aimed at improving your dog s dental health. BARK Bright eliminates the arduous task of brushing a dog s teeth while still effectively fighting germs and bad breath. Our BARK Bright dental kit provides an innovative regimen for dog dental care. 
 Overall, we see significant runway in our consumables category long-term, and anticipate the majority of our future growth may be driven by these product categories. 
 BARK Air Announced in April 2024, BARK Air is a first-of-its kind air travel experience tailored to dogs. The Company partnered with a jet charter company, offering premium flights for customers and their dogs. Interested parties can book flights at dogsflyfirst.com. Our charter partner is responsible for all aircraft, crew, maintenance, and insurance, allowing BARK to focus on creating a great travel experience for dogs and their people worldwide. We believe this initiative exemplifies the Company s dog-first approach to curating the best products and services.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, management believes that Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Free Cash Flow, all non-GAAP financial measures (together the Non-GAAP Measures ), provide investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance. 
 We calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net loss, adjusted to exclude: (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) change in fair value of warrants and derivatives, (3) sales and use tax income, (4) restructuring charges related to reduction in force payments, (5) litigation expenses, (6) warehouse restructuring costs, (7) non-cash impairment of previously capitalized software and cloud computing implementation costs, (8) technology modernization costs, and (9) other items (as defined below). 
 We calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Margin by dividing Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the period by Revenue for the period. 
 We calculate Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share by dividing Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the period by weighted average common shares used to compute net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders for the period. 
 We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted to exclude: (1) interest income, (2) interest expense, (3) depreciation and amortization, (4) stock-based compensation expense, (5) change in fair value of warrants and derivatives, (6) capitalized cloud computing amortization, (7) sales and use tax income, (8) restructuring charges related to reduction in force payments, (9) litigation expenses, (10) warehouse restructuring costs, (11) non-cash impairment of previously capitalized software and cloud computing implementation costs, (12) technology modernization costs, and (13) other items (as defined below). 
 We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for the period by revenue for the period. 
 We calculate Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. 
 The Non-GAAP Measures are financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that the Non-GAAP Measures, when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of the Non-GAAP Measures are helpful to our investors as they are measures used by management in assessing the health of our business, determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. 
 29 

The Non-GAAP Measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations of the Non-GAAP Measures include that (1) the measures do not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future, (2) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect these capital expenditures, (3) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense, which is an ongoing expense for our company, (4) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect other non-operating expenses, including interest expense. In addition, our use of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate the Non-GAAP Measures in the same manner, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider the Non-GAAP Measures alongside other financial measures, including our net loss and other results stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and (5) Free cash flow does not represent the total residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes and does not reflect our future contractual commitments.

 (1) Sales and use tax expense relates to recording a liability for sales and use tax we did not collect from our customers. Historically, we had collected state or local sales, use, or other similar taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we only had physical presence. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., that state and local jurisdictions may, at least in certain circumstances, enforce a sales and use tax collection obligation on remote vendors that have no physical presence in such jurisdiction. A number of states have positioned themselves to require sales and use tax collection by remote vendors and/or by online marketplaces. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state and accordingly, we recorded a liability in those periods in which we created economic nexus based on each state s requirements. Accordingly, we now collect, remit, and report sales tax in all states that impose a sales tax. Subsequently, as certain of these liabilities are waived by tax authorities or the applicable statute of limitations expires, the related accrued liability is reversed. 
 (2) Litigation expenses related to a shareholder class action complaint, see Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 (3) Includes consulting fees related to technology transformation activities, and payroll costs for employees that dedicate significant time to this project. We believe that these costs are discrete and non-recurring in nature, as they relate to a one-time unification of our product offerings on our new commerce platform. As such, they are not normal, recurring operating expenses and are not reflective of ongoing trends in the cost of doing business. 
 
 (4) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, other items is comprised of executive transition costs including recruiting costs of less than 0.1 million, costs associated with the share repurchase program of less than 0.1 million, and duplicate headquarters rent of less than 0.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, other items is comprised of executive transition costs including recruiting costs of 0.4 million and non-recurring retention payments to management of 0.4 million. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, other items is comprised of executive transition costs including recruiting costs of 0.4 million, non-recurring retention payments to management of 0.2 million, costs associated with the share repurchase program of 0.2 million, and duplicate headquarters rent of less than 0.1 
 31 

million. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, other items is comprised of non-recurring retention payments to management of 0.6 million, executive transition costs including recruiting costs of 0.4 million, and duplicate headquarters rent of less than 0.1 million. 

The following table presents a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP, for each of the periods indicated:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since inception, we have funded our operations with proceeds from sales of our capital stock and proceeds from borrowings in addition to cash generated by our operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 115.2 million. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by our operating activities and proceeds from borrowings (as defined below), will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. We are required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants related to our borrowing agreements, which we expect to be in compliance with during the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of new and existing customer growth and our investments in partnerships and unexplored channels. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. 
 2025 Convertible Notes 
 On November 27, 2020, the Company issued 75.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Convertible Notes (the 2025 Convertible Notes to Magnetar Capital, LLC Magnetar under an indenture, dated as of November 27, 2020, between Legacy BARK and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and collateral agent (the Indenture ). The Company received net proceeds of approximately 74.7 million from the sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes, after deducting fees and expenses of approximately 0.3 million. The Company recorded the expenses associated with the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes as a discount to the note and will amortize the expenses over the term of the note. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. 
 The 2025 Convertible Notes are governed by the Indenture. The 2025 Convertible Notes bear interest at the annual rate of 5.50 , payable entirely in payment-in-kind annually on December 1 st of each year commencing December 1, 2021, compounded annually. The accrued interest of 2.1 million and 4.4 million was paid-in-kind through an increase of the outstanding principal on the 2025 Convertible Notes on December 1, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 If the 2025 Convertible Notes are not converted into common stock by the maturity date, the Company must repay the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. 
 The 2025 Convertible Notes contain call and put options to be settled in cash contingent upon the occurrence of a change of control and a default interest rate increase of 3.0 applicable upon the occurrence of an event of default that when evaluated under the guidance of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , are embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation at fair value. The fair value calculation includes Level 3 inputs including the estimated fair value of the 
 32 

Company s common stock and assumptions regarding the probability that the contingent call or put will be exercised or an event of default will occur. Management determined that the probability that the contingent events will occur was near zero at inception and has remained near zero as of September 30, 2024. Therefore, the Company did not record a derivative liability related to these features as of September 30, 2024. The Company will assess the probability of occurrence quarterly during the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. 
 On November 2, 2023, the Company repurchased 45.0 million of the 83.5 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.50 Convertible Secured Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Convertible Notes from entities affiliated with Magnetar Financial, LLC (collectively, the Holders ), pursuant to the terms and conditions of a negotiated notes purchase agreement (the Agreement among the Company and the Holders. 
 Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company repurchased 45.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes plus 2.2 million of accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding the repurchase date, from the Holders for a total cash purchase price of 44.4 million. In addition, 1.0 million of unamortized deferred financing fees were derecognized from the Company s balance sheet on the date of extinguishment. The accelerated deferred financing fees were recognized as a component of gain on extinguishment of debt. The Company recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of 1.8 million in connection with the repurchase. If a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture) of the Company occurs at any time after the date of the Agreement and prior to the December 1, 2025 maturity date of the Notes, the Holders are also entitled to receive an additional cash true-up payment from the Company, totaling, in the aggregate for all Holders, either (i) 11.3 million in the case that the Company elects to redeem all of the Notes outstanding at the time of such Change of Control or (ii) 4.5 million in the case that the Holders elect to require the Company to repurchase all of the 2025 Convertible Notes outstanding at the time of such Change of Control any other case, in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Agreement. 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had 40.6 million of outstanding borrowings under the note purchase agreement governing the purchase and sale of the 2025 Convertible Notes agreement.

 Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities is derived by adjusting our net loss for: 
 non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and other non-cash income or expenses; and

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about items that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Except as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended March 31, 2024 contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 3, 2024. 
 35 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 115.2 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held 29.9 million in a money market account. The Company does not have any other investments. We have not been exposed, nor do we anticipate being exposed, to material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 We are primarily exposed to changes in short-term interest rates with respect to our cost of borrowing under our Western Alliance Agreement. As of September 30, 2024 there are no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Nonetheless, if our costs or if consumer discretionary spending were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases or demand for our products could decrease. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 We operate our business primarily within the United States and currently execute the majority of our transactions in U.S. dollars. We have not utilized hedging strategies with respect to such foreign exchange exposure. This limited foreign currency translation risk is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )). Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 On March 20, 2024, three alleged shareholders filed a putative class action complaint in the lawsuit styled Kenville v. Northern Star Sponsor LLC, et al., Case No. 2024-276, which is pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On September 30, 2024, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint is brought against (a) certain officers and directors of Northern Star Acquisition Corp. at the time of its proposed acquisition of Legacy BARK, (b) Northern Star Sponsor, LLC, (c) two of the founders of Legacy BARK, and (d) the Company. The alleged class consists of Company stockholders who held stock as of the redemption deadline and who elected not to redeem all or some of their stock, and the claims alleged are for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. At this time, the Company is not able to quantify any potential liability in connection with this litigation because the case is in its early stages. 
 In addition, we are from time to time subject to, and are presently involved in, litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While it is not possible to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, there are no pending lawsuits or claims that, individually or in the aggregate, may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. Our views and estimates related to these matters may change in the future, as new events and circumstances arise and as the matters continue to develop. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not known to us or that we consider immaterial as of the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See also "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Risks Related to Our Strategy 
 Our future operating performance is subject to numerous challenges and uncertainties. 
 Our past operating performance may not be indicative of our future operating performance, which will depend on our ability to leverage our competitive strengths and execute on our strategy. Our competitive strengths include: our proprietary product and customer data; strong customer relationships; vertically integrated design, development and manufacturing of our products; and omnichannel approach including both direct to consumer and retail sales. Our strategy is to expand into new product categories, in particular the consumables category; create a unified customer experience; and focus on the path to profitability. Our ability to leverage our competitive strengths and execute on our strategy is subject to numerous challenges and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the following: 
 our migration of current and future customers to our unified platform; 
 costs or other issues with acquiring new customers and retaining existing customers; 
 adverse impacts on shipping and fulfillment services and costs, including related to shipping lane constraints and/or labor disputes; 
 changes in trends and consumer preferences; 
 interruptions in our business due to technology failures, cybersecurity breaches or labor shortages; 
 our ability to retain existing suppliers and attract new suppliers and scale our supply chain; 
 our ability to develop a unified, scalable, high-performance technology and fulfillment infrastructure; 
 37 

our ability to hire and retain talented, experienced people at all levels of our organization; and 
 changes in the macro-economic environment, such as inflation, increasing interest rates, instability in the banking system or financial markets, changes in the labor markets, and political, economic and social instability, such as wars, armed conflicts or pandemics, in particular as such changes impact consumer discretionary spending. 
 If we fail to meet the challenges or navigate the uncertainties described above, as well as those described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. 
 We may fail to acquire new customers in a cost-effective manner. 
 In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to customers who have historically purchased their dog products from other retailers, such as traditional brick and mortar retailers or the websites of our competitors. While we believe that many of our new customers originate from word-of-mouth and other non-paid referrals from our current customers, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to acquire new customers. We must be able to appropriately, effectively and efficiently allocate our marketing spend for multiple products, including: accurately identifying, targeting and reaching our audience of current and potential customers with our marketing messages; selecting the right marketplace, media and specific media vehicle in which to advertise; adapting quickly to changes in the algorithmic logic, privacy policies, and other procedures used by search engines, social media platforms and other third party platforms; identifying the most effective and efficient level of spending in each marketplace, media and specific media vehicle; determining the appropriate creative message and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures; managing marketing costs, including creative and media expenses, in order to maintain acceptable customer acquisition costs; differentiating our products as compared to other products; creating greater brand awareness; driving traffic to our websites, and websites of our retail partners and adapting our marketing tactics as e-commerce, search, and social networking evolve. Also, search engines, social media platforms frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected. Moreover, a search engine or social media platform could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results, causing our websites to place lower in search query results. In addition, social networking and e-commerce channels continue to rapidly evolve, including with regard to their policies and procedures, and we may be unable to cost-effectively develop or maintain a presence within these channels. If the costs of acquiring new customers exceeds our expectations, we may not be able to acquire the necessary number of customers who purchase products in volumes sufficient to grow our business and generate the scale necessary to achieve operational efficiency and/or our margins could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be unable to maintain a high level of customer engagement or protect our brand and reputation. 
 Our strong customer relationships and our brand and reputation are the basis for the high-level customer engagement that drives increases to our average order volume and our overall growth. A significant portion of our revenue is recurring revenue from subscription customers, especially those customers who are highly engaged and purchase our add-to-box offerings which include toys, treats, toppers, dental and other products. Maintaining and protecting our brand and reputation depends largely on our ability to provide our customers with an engaging and personalized customer experience, including valued services, high-quality merchandise, appropriate prices and highly-trained customer support representatives. Customer complaints or negative reviews or publicity about our products, services, merchandise, monthly themes, delivery times, or customer support, especially on social media platforms, could harm our brand and reputation and diminish customer use of our services and the trust that our customers place in us. Also, if our customers no longer find our products appealing or appropriately priced, they may make fewer purchases and may cancel their subscriptions or stop purchasing products. Even if our existing customers continue to find our offerings appealing, they may decide to reduce their subscription and purchase less merchandise over time as their interest in new dog products decline. Failure to maintain our high level of engagement and protect our brand and reputation with our customers would cause our revenue to decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to accurately predict consumer trends, successfully introduce new products, improve existing products, or expand into new offerings. 
 38 

Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to successfully introduce new products to our existing BarkBox and Super Chewer subscriptions and Toys accessories and Consumables categories, and to improve and reposition our existing products to meet the requirements of our customers and the needs of their dogs. To be successful, we must accurately predict and respond to evolving consumer trends, demands and preferences, including predicting monthly themes for our BarkBox and Super Chewer subscriptions that will resonate with customers as timely and clever. The development and introduction of new products and expansion into new offerings also involves considerable costs. Any new product or offering may not generate sufficient customer interest to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion and could result in a decrease in customer retention, a reduction in purchases or negatively affect our brand and reputation. If we are unable to anticipate, identify, develop or market products, or create new offerings that respond to changes in customer requirements and preferences, or if our new product introductions, repositioned products, or new offerings fail to gain consumer acceptance, we may be unable to grow our business as anticipated, or our revenue, margins and profitability may decline or not improve, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and senior management. 
 Our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent on the contributions of our senior management and other key personnel. In addition, our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The market for such positions is competitive. Qualified individuals are in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or other key employees or our inability to recruit and develop mid-level managers could impede our ability to execute our business plan and we may be unable to find adequate replacements. All of our employees are at-will employees, meaning that they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry could be extremely difficult to replace. If we fail to retain talented senior management and other key personnel, or if we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 We face challenges due to our reliance on third party sales channels to sell and distribute our products. 
 We sell some of our products through a network of retailers and e-tailers (in addition to our direct sales channel). Our products are available through Amazon.com as well as in retail locations including Target, Petco, PetSmart, Costco, Walmart, Kroger and CVS, and many others. We depend on these indirect sales channel partners to distribute and sell our products to dog parents, which subjects us to a number of challenges, including: 
 the sales and business practices, reputation or failure to comply with laws and regulations, of or by our sales channel partners, of which we may or may not be aware, may affect our business and reputation; 
 adverse changes in our relationships with our sales channel partners could impact sales of our products; 
 economic conditions, labor issues, natural disasters, severe weather events, regional or global pandemics, evolving consumer preferences, and purchasing patterns of our distribution partners, or competition between our sales channels, could result in sales channel disruption; 
 our sales channel partners, who also sell products offered by our competitors, and in the case of retailer house brands, may also be our competitors, which sales may compete with our own products; 
 certain of our sales channel partners could decide to de-emphasize the product categories that we offer, change their algorithmic logic, policies or procedures making our products harder for customers to find, or remove them from e-commerce sites altogether; and 
 building relationships with new channel partners or adapting to new distribution and marketing models in order to expand into new product categories and markets may require significant management attention and operational resources, and affect our accounting, including revenue recognition, gross margins, and the ability to make comparisons from period to period. 
 If we fail to effectively meet the challenges described above our business and future operating results will be materially adversely affected. 
 39 

Risks Related to the Macro-Economic Environment 
 We rely on consumer discretionary spending, which may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends. 
 Our business depends on consumer discretionary spending. Some of the factors that may negatively influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment; higher consumer debt levels; reductions in net worth, declines in asset values, and related market uncertainty; home foreclosures and reductions in home values; fluctuating interest rates and credit availability; bank failures; global pandemics, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs; fluctuating commodity prices; and the high rate of inflation and general uncertainty regarding the overall future political and economic environment. Furthermore, any increases in consumer discretionary spending during times of crisis may be temporary, such as those related to government stimulus programs or remote-work environments, and consumer spending may decrease when those programs or circumstances end. In addition, economic conditions in certain regions may be affected by natural disasters or severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, and wildfires; other public health crises; and other major unforeseen events. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including the merchandise that we offer, generally decline during recessionary periods or periods of economic uncertainty, when disposable income is reduced or when there is a reduction in consumer confidence. Any decline in consumer discretionary spending could negatively impact our revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be impacted by global disruptions or disasters. 
 The extent to which global disruptions or disasters or severe weather events, may impact our business will depend on nature, scope and geographic impact of the disruption or disaster. A significant portion of our workforce, and the workforce of our partners, continue to work remotely. Natural disasters, power outages, connectivity issues, or other events that impact our employees or our partners ability to work remotely, could disrupt business for a substantial period of time. Global disruptions or disasters or severe weather events, have had, and could have, unprecedented and unexpected effects on the global economy, civil society, labor markets, and certain industries. As a result, it is difficult to predict the magnitude or scope of the adverse impacts that these effects may have directly, or indirectly, on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to our Manufacturing, Inventory and Supply Chain 
 Our business critically relies on a limited number of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners. 
 We rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers, suppliers and logistics providers to manufacture and transport our products. We do not currently have alternative or replacement providers and we do not generally maintain long-term supply contracts with any of these providers. We face a number of risks relating to these providers, including: 
 our suppliers, manufacturers or logistics partners could be impacted by a natural disaster or severe weather events, an epidemic or pandemic, or other interruptions at a particular location; 
 our manufacturers and suppliers are primarily located in Asia, which introduces risks related to geopolitical developments and differences in regulatory standards and legal systems; 
 our existing supply channels may not be able to satisfy a significant increase in demand for our products, or we may need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier. It could take a significant amount of time to identify a manufacturer or supplier that has the capability and resources to manufacture our products to our specifications in sufficient volume, and with acceptable quality control, technical capabilities, responsiveness and service, financial stability, regulatory compliance, and labor and other ethical practices; 
 our current product purchases are centralized among a few manufacturers and suppliers to realize substantial cost savings, which exposes us to credit and other risks, including insolvency, financial difficulties, supply chain delays or other factors which may result in our manufacturers or suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us; and 
 we have signed a number of contracts whose performance depends upon third party suppliers delivering products on schedule to meet our contractual commitments. Concentration in the number of our manufacturers and suppliers could lead to delays in the delivery of products or components, and possible 
 40 

resultant breaches of contracts that we have entered into with our customers; increases in the prices we must pay for products; problems with product quality; and other concerns. 
 Any of the above risks could delay delivery of our products to customers in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We face challenges due to limited control over our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics partners. 
 We have limited control over our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics partners, which subjects us to the following risks, many of which materialized during the COVID-19 pandemic, including: failure to satisfy demand for our products; reduced control over delivery timing, product reliability, the manufacturing process and components used in our products; limited ability to develop comprehensive manufacturing specifications that take into account any materials shortages or substitutions; variance in the manufacturing capability of our third-party manufacturers; price increases; failure of a significant supplier, manufacturer, or logistics partner to perform its obligations for technical, market, or other reasons; misappropriation of our intellectual property; changes in local economic conditions in the jurisdictions where our suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners are located; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on currency exchange or the transfer of funds; and insufficient warranties and indemnities on components supplied to our manufacturers or performance by our partners. If we fail to meet the challenges described above, our business and future operating results will be materially adversely affected. 
 Shipping, which is subject to numerous risks, is a critical part of our business. 
 We currently rely on third-party national, regional and local logistics providers to deliver our products. We may not be able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms with these providers, or these providers may experience performance problems or other difficulties in processing our orders or delivering our products to customers. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship merchandise to customers may be negatively affected by factors beyond our and these providers control, including severe weather events, natural disasters, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other events specifically impacting our or other shipping partners, such as labor disputes, financial difficulties, system failures and other disruptions to the operations of the shipping companies on which we rely. We are also subject to risks of damage or loss during delivery by our shipping vendors. If the products ordered by our customers are not delivered in a timely fashion or are damaged or lost during the delivery process, our customers could become dissatisfied and cease buying our products. Further, there may be disruptions and delays in national, regional and local shipping, which may negatively impact our customers experience. Changes to the terms of our shipping arrangements and delays or failures in delivery of our products may have a material adverse effect on our margins and profitability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be unable to manage the complexities created by our omnichannel operations. 
 Our omnichannel operations, such as offering our products through our websites, on third party websites and in traditional brick and mortar stores, create additional complexities in our ability to manage inventory levels, as well as certain operational issues, including timely shipping and refunds. Accordingly, our success depends to a large degree on continually evolving the processes and technology that enable us to plan and manage inventory levels and fulfill orders, address any related operational issues and further align channels to optimize our omnichannel operations. If we are unable to successfully manage these complexities, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 
 If we are unable to implement appropriate systems, procedures and controls, we may not be able to successfully offer our products, grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner. 
 Our ability to successfully offer our products, grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner requires an effective planning and management process and certain other automated management and accounting systems. We currently do not have a fully integrated enterprise resource planning system and certain other automated management and accounting systems. We periodically update our operations and financial systems, procedures and controls; however, our current procedures may not scale proportionately with our business growth or with becoming a public company. Our systems will continue to require automation, modifications and improvements to respond to current and future changes in our business. Failure to implement in a timely manner appropriate 
 41 

internal systems, procedures and controls could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to successfully optimize, operate and manage our fulfillment centers and shipping services. 
 If we do not optimize and operate our fulfillment centers and shipping services successfully and efficiently, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment capacity, an increase in costs and/or inventory shrinkage or impairment charges or harm to our business in other ways. In addition, if we do not have sufficient fulfillment or shipping capacity or experience a problem fulfilling or shipping orders in a timely manner, our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers. We also anticipate the need to add additional fulfillment center and shipping capacity as our business continues to grow. We may not be able to locate suitable facilities or services on commercially acceptable terms in accordance with our expansion plans, or recruit qualified managerial and operational supply personnel to support our expansion plans. If we are unable to secure new facilities for the expansion of our fulfillment and shipping operations, recruit qualified personnel to support any such facilities, or effectively control expansion-related expenses, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Industry 
 Our estimate of the size of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate. 
 Data for retail sales of dog products is collected for most, but not all channels, and as a result, it is difficult to accurately estimate the size of the market and predict with certainty the rate at which the market for our products will grow, if at all. While our market size estimate was made in good faith and is based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, this estimate may not be accurate. If our estimates of the size of our addressable market are not accurate, our potential for future growth may be less than we currently anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to compete effectively in the dog products and services retail industry. 
 The dog products and services retail industry, in particular on the Internet, is highly competitive and we expect this competition to continue to increase. We compete with pet product retail stores, supermarkets, warehouse clubs and other mass and general retail and online merchandisers. We also compete with a number of specialty dog supply stores and independent dog stores, catalog retailers and other specialty e-tailers. As we expand our offerings, such as consumables and BARK Air, we will face additional competition. For example, in the consumables category, there are numerous brands and products that compete for shelf space and sales, with competition based primarily upon brand recognition and loyalty, product packaging, quality and innovation, taste, nutrition, breadth of product line, price and convenience. Many of these current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater technical capabilities, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than we do, allowing our competitors to derive greater net sales and profits from their existing customer base, acquire customers at lower costs or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer preferences or habits. Our competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies (including but not limited to predatory pricing policies and the provision of substantial discounts), allowing them to build larger customer bases or generate gross profit from their customer bases more effectively than we do. Current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others. If we fail to compete effectively, or are required to offer promotions and other incentives or adopt more aggressive pricing strategies, our operating margins could decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity 
 We are subject to risks related to online payment methods. 
 We currently accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, Shop Pay and gift cards. As we offer new payment options to customers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements, fraud and other risks. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data 
 42 

Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Furthermore, as our business changes, we may be subject to different rules under existing standards, which may require new assessments that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. In the future, as we offer new payment options to customers, including by way of integrating emerging mobile and other payment methods, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud, if our customers re-use their login and password information across multiple websites, exposing us to breaches on other sites. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card payments from customers or facilitate other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected. 
 We rely on software-as-a-service SaaS technologies from third parties. 
 We rely on SaaS technologies from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including financial management services, credit card processing, customer relationship management services, supply chain services and data storage services. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices, or for any other reason, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted, our processes for managing sales of our offerings and supporting our customers could be impaired, our ability to communicate with our suppliers could be weakened and our ability to access or save data stored to the cloud may be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented. We are also subject to certain standard terms and conditions with these providers, who have broad discretion to change their terms of service and other policies with respect to us, which may be unfavorable. Any failure to maintain successful partnerships with our SaaS providers could impact our success and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Limitations on our use of cookies may impact our ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers. 
 The use of third-party cookies is the subject of litigation, regulatory scrutiny and industry self-regulatory 
 activities. Federal and state governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third-party cookies and other methods of online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes. The U.S. government has enacted, or has considered or is considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies or to block other tracking technologies, which if widely adopted could result in making cookies and other methods of online tracking significantly less effective. This regulation of the use of cookies and other current online tracking and advertising practices, and litigation related to the same, or the loss of our ability to make effective use of services that employ such technologies could limit our ability to acquire new customers on cost-effective terms, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may be unable to maintain and scale our technology. 
 Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our customers depends on the reliable performance of our websites and mobile application and our cloud-based solutions. The operation of these systems, and the consolidation of our websites and related migration of our current and future customers to our unified platform, is complex and could result in operational failures. Interruptions or delays in these systems, or in the consolidation of our websites, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, undetected errors, design faults or other unexpected events or causes, could affect the security or availability of our websites and mobile application and prevent our customers from accessing our websites and mobile application. If sustained or repeated, these performance issues could reduce the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, the costs and complexities involved in consolidating our websites or expanding and upgrading our systems may prevent us from doing so in a timely manner and may prevent us from adequately meeting the demand placed on our systems. Any web or mobile platform interruption or inadequacy that causes performance issues or interruptions in the availability of our websites or mobile application could reduce consumer satisfaction and result in a reduction in the 
 43 

number of customers using our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our disaster recovery arrangements may be insufficient. 
 The occurrence of a natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, data loss, computer virus, an act of terrorism, cyberattack, vandalism or sabotage, act of war or any similar event, or a decision to close the third-party data centers on which we normally operate or the facilities of any other third-party provider without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our websites and mobile application. Cloud computing, in particular, is dependent upon having access to an Internet connection in order to retrieve data. If a natural disaster or severe weather events, global pandemic, blackout or other unforeseen event were to occur that disrupted our ability to obtain an Internet connection, we may experience a slowdown or delay in our operations. While we have some limited disaster recovery arrangements in place, our preparations may not be adequate to account for disasters or similar events that may occur in the future and may not effectively permit us to continue operating in the event of any problems with respect to our systems or those of our third-party data centers or any other third-party facilities. Our disaster recovery and data redundancy plans may be inadequate, and our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses that could occur. If any such event were to occur to our business, our operations could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The security of our and our partners computer networks and databases containing personal information may be compromised. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we and our vendors collect, process, and store certain personal information and other data relating to individuals, such as our customers and employees, including customer payment card information. We rely substantially on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our processing, transmission, and storage of personal information and other confidential information. We, or our vendors, may suffer a data compromise from hackers or other unauthorized parties who gain access to personal information or other data, including payment card data or confidential business information, which may not be discovered in a timely fashion. In addition, cyber-attacks such as ransomware attacks could lock us out of our information systems and disrupt our operations, or the operations of the vendors or manufacturers on which we rely. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, and we, and our vendors, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. If our business partners work remotely, they may be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In addition, our vendors, or other third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to misappropriate personal information, confidential information, or other data, or may inadvertently release or compromise such data. Compromise of our data security by third parties with whom we do business, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information, and delays in detecting or providing prompt notice of any such compromise or loss may disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and subject us to litigation, government action, or other additional costs and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 
 We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. 
 We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, agreements and other methods with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country and the protection of our intellectual property rights may require significant financial, managerial and operational expenditures. In addition, our efforts may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property rights and any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. Our patent and trademark applications may never be granted and the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming. We may be unable to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Even if issued, these patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of patent protection are uncertain. In addition, others may independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology. Our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent 
 44 

disclosure of our proprietary information, technologies and processes and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may be unable to discover or determine the extent of any infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights or costs associated with such protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations. 
 Third parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. These claims, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in considerable litigation costs, injunctions against us or the payment of damages or royalties by us, require significant amounts of management time or divert significant operational resources or cause expensive changes to our business model. In addition, we may be unable to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. Any payments we are required to make and any injunctions against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings 
 We are subject to federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, advertising and consumer protection. 
 We rely on a variety of marketing techniques, including email and social media marketing and postal mailings, which are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. A variety of federal and state laws and regulations also govern our collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data, particularly in the context of the online advertising that we rely on to attract new customers. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, in particular from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with other laws and regulations. In addition, various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, and advertising. For example, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA ), which requires companies that process information on California residents make new disclosures to customers about the collection of their data, use and sharing practices, and allow customers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA significantly amends the CCPA and imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California Privacy Protection Agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which could result in increased regulatory scrutiny of businesses in the areas of data protection and security. Similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that could make compliance challenging. We are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws related to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could adversely affect our business model and make it more difficult for us to retain and attract new customers. Our practices and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations may not always be effective, particularly as the legal landscape continues to evolve. In addition, some of our internal processes are manual, which could result in employee error and internal compliance failures. Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, liabilities, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, customers, suppliers or others, or may require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data. Any such claims, proceedings or actions could further harm our reputation and brand, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings or actions, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and suppliers and result in the imposition of monetary penalties. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of our non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business. Any harm to our 
 45 

reputation or brand, being subject to regulatory action and incurring related fees, distraction of our management and loss of customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to product safety, labor, or other laws. 
 The products we sell to our customers are subject to regulation by the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and similar state and international regulatory authorities. As such, our products could be subject to recalls and other remedial actions. Product safety, labeling, and licensing concerns may result in our voluntarily removing selected products from our inventory. Recalls or voluntary removal of products can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation, increased customer service costs and legal expenses. In addition, some of the merchandise we sell may expose us to product liability claims, litigation or regulatory actions. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors may not indemnify us from product liability for a particular vendor s merchandise or our vendors may not have sufficient resources or insurance to satisfy their indemnity and defense obligations. In addition, failure of our vendors to comply with applicable laws and regulations and contractual requirements could lead to litigation against us, resulting in increased legal expenses. Furthermore, the failure of any vendors to provide safe and humane factory conditions at their facilities could damage our reputation with our customers and result in legal claims against us. Our international relationships also require us to overcome logistical and other challenges based on differing languages, cultures, legal and regulatory schemes and time zones. Foreign labor laws, standards and customs may vary greatly from those in the U.S. The U.S. or foreign countries could enact legislation or impose regulations, including unfavorable labor regulations, tax policies or economic sanctions that could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business in the countries in which we have relationships. The difficulties inherent in complying with labor, safety and other laws, or consequences resulting from any failure to comply with those laws could result in increased costs, disruptions in our relationships with our vendors, and harm to our brand and reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to extensive governmental regulation. 
 We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public and worker health and safety, natural resources and the environment. Our operations, including our manufacturing partners, are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture and by various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products, including food safety standards. In addition, we and our manufacturing partners are subject to additional regulatory requirements, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety legislative and regulatory authorities and the National Labor Relations Board, covering such areas as discharges and emissions to air and water, the use, management, disposal and remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, and public and worker health and safety. Violations of, or liability under, any of these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil or criminal fines, penalties or sanctions against us, revocation or modification of applicable permits, licenses or authorizations, environmental, health and safety investigations or remedial activities, voluntary or involuntary product recalls, warning or untitled letters or cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance, among other things. Such laws and regulations generally have become more stringent over time and may become more so in the future, and we may incur (directly, or indirectly through our manufacturing partners) material costs to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any required product recalls. Complying with the current laws and regulations, and potential future changes to these laws and regulations, or failing to comply with these laws and regulations, could impose significant limitations and/or require changes to our business, which may involve substantial expenses, make our business more costly and less efficient to conduct, and compromise our growth strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, rules or regulations. 
 Existing tax laws, rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by tax authorities or amendment, repeal, or new enactments. For example, the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. required us 
 46 

to collect sales tax in many jurisdictions despite our lack of a physical presence in such jurisdictions. Also, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may limit our ability to use our substantial net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income, which is further dependent upon by our ability to generate taxable income before the expiration dates of the net operating losses, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our net operating losses. We are currently monitoring changes in the tax landscape, however, it is difficult to predict whether such changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Current and future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Lawsuits and other administrative, regulatory, or legal proceedings that may arise in the course of our operations can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations and companies have experienced fluctuations in their stock prices that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to their operating results. Under these circumstances, stockholders may sometimes institute securities class action litigation against such companies. Any litigation or other administrative, regulatory, or legal proceedings against us could result in substantial costs, and divert management s attention and resources. Although we generally maintain insurance to mitigate certain costs, there can be no assurance that costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies. Moreover, we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, or to secure additional coverage, which may result in costs associated with lawsuits and other legal proceedings being uninsured. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fees associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings or a judgment, penalty or fine is not fully or is only partially covered by insurance. 
 General Risks Related to Our Business 
 Our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies could prove to be incorrect. 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires our management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity as of the date of the financial statements, and the amount of revenue and expenses, during the periods presented, that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements include those related to determination of fair value of the Company s allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, excess and obsolete inventory, stock-based compensation, stand-alone selling price of Direct to Consumer offerings, and the fair value of right-of-use assets. If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, our operating results could fall below the expectations of industry or financial analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock. 
 We may be unable to accurately forecast our revenue and appropriately plan for our expenses in the future. 
 Revenue is difficult to forecast with certainty because it depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including the volume, timing, and type of orders we receive and increased third party costs or transportation and freight costs. Many of these factors are uncertain and are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. We base our expense levels and investment plans on our estimates of revenues and gross margins, and many of our expenses, such as office leases, manufacturing costs and personnel costs, will be relatively fixed in the short term and will increase as we continue to make investments in our business and hire additional personnel. If our revenue forecasts do not cover our planned operating expenses, our business and future operating results will be materially adversely affected. 
 We have in the past and may in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 In order to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we must perform system and process evaluations, document our controls and perform testing of our key controls over financial reporting to allow for management and our independent public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over 
 47 

financial reporting. In the past, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which we have remedied. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future that are deemed to be material weaknesses, our investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, we may be required to restate those financial statements, the market price of our stock may decline and we could be subject to lawsuits, sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources and otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Certain of our key performance indicators are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies. 
 We track certain key performance indicators, including metrics such as total orders and average order value, with internal systems and tools. Estimates or similar metrics published by third parties may differ from our reported key performance indications, due to differences in sources, methodologies, or assumptions. For example, we rely on third-party marketing analytics systems to identify marketing spend by channel, which we then reconcile across a number of systems. In addition, we rely on third-party warehouse and fulfillment providers to communicate the receiving and shipping information that drives active customer count and related data. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our key performance indicators, including the metrics or estimates that we publicly disclose. While these metrics or estimates are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring our key performance indicators. Some of these challenges include manual reconciliation of information provided by different input systems, resulting in undetected errors. If our key performance indicators are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our key performance indicators to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these numbers, our reputation may be significantly harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. 
 We expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we increase our advertising, expand into new markets, expand our offerings, hire additional personnel, incur additional expenses related to being a public company and continue to develop features on our websites and mobile applications. In particular, we intend to continue to invest substantial resources to grow and diversify our product offerings and in marketing to acquire new customers. Our operating expenses may also be adversely impacted by increased costs and delays in launching in new markets and expanding fulfillment center capacity. Our future growth and operating performance must eventually offset our operating losses or we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. 
 We may fail to manage or integrate acquisitions of, or investments in, new or complementary businesses, facilities, technologies or products, or through strategic alliances. 
 From time to time, we may consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, facilities, technologies, offerings, or products, or enter into strategic alliances, in order to enhance our capabilities, expand our outsourcing and supplier network, complement our current products or expand the breadth of our offerings. Acquisitions, investments and other strategic alliances involve numerous risks, including: problems integrating the acquired business, facilities, technologies, customers, partners or products, issues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies; unanticipated costs; diversion of management s attention from our existing business; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, manufacturing partners, and retail partners; challenges with entering new markets in which we may have limited or no experience; potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses; and increased legal, accounting and compliance costs. Failure to integrate acquired businesses, facilities, technologies and products effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our operating flexibility may be limited by our credit facilities and debt instruments. 
 Our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2025 Convertible Notes both limit our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt; make certain investments and acquisitions; incur certain liens or permit them to exist; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; merge or consolidate with another company; and transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including our cash. In addition, if our stock price 
 48 

does not meet the conversion price of the 2025 Convertible Notes, then we will have to repay the principal of the 2025 Convertible Notes in cash, which we may not have available. Our revolving credit facility also contains covenants requiring us to satisfy certain financial covenants. These limitations, requirements and costs may affect our ability to obtain future financing, pursue attractive business opportunities, maintain flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to raise the capital we need to grow our business. 
 In the future, we could be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. We may sell common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors in our common stock may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our operational flexibility or profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may be forced to raise funds on undesirable terms, or our business may contract or we may be unable to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 Our stock price may be volatile or decline regardless of our operating performance. 
 The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly or decline in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations; financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of BARK, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow BARK or our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of investors; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other retail or technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; trading volume of our common stock; the inclusion, exclusion or removal of our common stock from any indices; changes in members of our Board of Directors or management; transactions in our common stock by directors, officers, affiliates and other major investors; lawsuits threatened or filed against us; changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business; changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities; short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock; general economic conditions in the U.S. or global markets; other events or factors, such as a global pandemic, wars or other armed conflicts, inflation, bank failures, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and the other events or factors described in this Risk Factors section. 
 An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. 
 Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol BARK. An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. Accordingly, there may not be a liquid trading market in which to sell your shares of our common stock when desired or at acceptable prices. 
 Sales of shares by existing stockholders may cause our stock price to decline. 
 If our existing stockholders sell or indicate an intention to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. In addition, shares underlying any outstanding options and restricted stock units will become eligible for sale if exercised or settled, as applicable, and to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rule 144 of the Securities Act. All the shares of common stock subject to stock options outstanding and reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans have been registered on Form S-8 under the Securities Act and such shares are eligible for sale in the public markets, subject to Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. 
 Securities or industry analysts may not publish accurate or favorable research about BARK. 
 49 

The trading market for our common stock is influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our common stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock could decline. 
 Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by impeding a change in control of BARK or changes in our management that our stockholders may deem advantageous. These provisions include: a classified board; removal of directors only for cause or a super majority vote; super majority vote required to amend of certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and any provisions of our bylaws; issuance of blank check preferred stock authorized; stockholders may not call special stockholder meetings; stockholder action by written consent prohibited; indemnification of our director and officers; Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. 
 Substantially all disputes between BARK and our stockholders are subject to exclusive forum provisions. 
 Our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. This choice of forum provision does not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for any actions brought under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Accordingly, our exclusive forum provision will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. 
 We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 
 We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pay dividends, and any additional debt we may incur in the future may include similar restrictions. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. 
 Ownership of our stock is concentrated among our current officers, directors and their respective affiliates. 
 Our existing executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates, together as a group, beneficially own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock. This group, if it acts together, could have the ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. As a result, this group could, for example, delay or prevent a change in control of BARK and the approval of certain transactions. 
 We may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities, which would dilute your ownership interests and could depress the market price of our common stock. 
 We currently have options, RSUs and warrants outstanding that are convertible into shares of our common stock. In addition, our 2025 Convertible Notes are convertible based on outstanding principal balance and accrued interest. We also have the ability to issue equity awards that are convertible into shares of our common stock under our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan and under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, see Note 4 Debt, and Note 6 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, to our condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions or repayment of outstanding 
 50 

indebtedness, without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would dilute our existing shareholders and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 
 Risks Related to the 2025 Convertible Notes 
 Our obligation to redeem the 2025 Convertible Notes may not protect holders of those notes. 
 Our obligation to offer to redeem the 2025 Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change will be triggered only by certain specified transactions. The term fundamental change is limited to certain specified transactions and may not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of the 2025 Convertible Notes or our common stock. Our obligation to offer to redeem the new notes upon a fundamental change would not necessarily afford holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving us. 
 There is no existing public trading market for the 2025 Convertible Notes. 
 No market for the 2025 Convertible Notes exists and may not develop. Even if a market develops, it may not persist. We do not intend to apply for listing of the 2025 Convertible Notes on any securities exchange or other market. The liquidity of any trading market and the trading price of the 2025 Convertible Notes may be adversely affected by changes in our financial performance or prospects and by changes in the financial performance of or prospects for companies in our industry generally.
