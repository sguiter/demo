SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, market growth and trends, and our objectives for future operations. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as anticipate, believe, contemplate, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, target, will, or would, or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following: 
 our expectations regarding our financial performance, including revenues, expenses, and margins, and our ability to achieve or maintain future profitability; 
 our ability to effectively manage our growth and investments, including through the evolution of our go-to-market GTM operating model; 
 anticipated performance, trends, growth rates, and challenges in our business and in the markets in which we currently or may in the future operate; 
 economic and industry trends, in particular the rate of adoption of construction management software and digitization of the construction industry, inflation, and challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions; 
 our ability to attract new customers and retain and increase sales to existing customers; 
 our ability to expand internationally; 
 the effects of increased competition in our markets and our ability to compete effectively; 
 our ability to develop new products, services, and features, and whether our customers and prospective customers will adopt these new products, services, and features; 
 our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand; 
 the sufficiency of our cash to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months; 
 future acquisitions, joint-ventures, or investments, including our strategic investments and investments in marketable securities; 
 our ability to comply or remain in compliance with laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our business in the United States U.S. and internationally; 
 our reliance on key personnel and our ability to attract, maintain, and retain management and skilled personnel; 
 the timing, price, and quantity of repurchases of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, and our ability to fund any such repurchases; 
 the future trading price of our common stock; and 
 our ability to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity threats and risks. 
 You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K dated February 26, 2024 (our 2023 Form 10-K ), and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be

These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to rely on these statements. 
 The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made.

In March 2024, the Company granted its CEO an aggregate target number of PSUs (the CEO PSUs that will vest (if at all) over a period, subject to the achievement of certain financial performance goals and continued service through the applicable vesting date. The actual number of CEO PSUs that become eligible to vest will be determined based on the attainment level of the applicable performance goal, as certified by the Compensation Committee of the Board. A target number of CEO PSUs of the CEO PSUs) will become eligible to vest based on the attainment level of a revenue performance goal for fiscal year 2024, which was set at the beginning of fiscal

 to of target. A target number of CEO PSUs of the CEO PSUs) will become eligible to vest based on the attainment of a non-GAAP operating margin performance goal for fiscal year 2024, which was set at the beginning of fiscal year 2024, with a payout range of to of target. One third of the CEO PSUs that become eligible to vest will vest on February 20, 2025 (or a subsequent quarterly vesting date, to the extent the number of CEO PSUs eligible to vest have not been certified by such date). The remaining CEO PSUs that become eligible to vest will vest in substantially equal installments quarterly over the following February 20, 2025. 
 The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs in the period in which it becomes probable that the underlying performance target will be achieved. Compensation expense for awards that contain performance conditions is calculated using the graded vesting method and the portion of expense recognized in any period may fluctuate depending on changing estimates of the achievement of the performance conditions.

 As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized stock based compensation cost for all PSUs outstanding was million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average vesting period of years. 
 Restricted stock awards 
 In November 2021, the Company issued RSAs to certain key employees in connection with the acquisition of Levelset that vest based on their continued service over a period. The fair value of the RSAs issued was per share, which was the closing trading stock price of the Company s common stock on the acquisition date. These shares are released from restriction quarterly over a period assuming the continued service of the employees. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all shares had vested, as such there was stock-based compensation expense recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of million, including million related to RSAs whose vesting was accelerated upon the departure of certain employees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company also expensed million related to the accelerated vesting of cash retention amounts upon such employees departure. 
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 In May 2021, the Board adopted, and the stockholders approved, the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ), which became effective immediately prior to the effective date of the Company s IPO. As of December 31, 2023, a total of shares of common stock had been reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of shares of the Company s common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP automatically increases on January 1 of each year for a period of , beginning on January 1, 2022 and continuing through January 1, 2031, by the lesser of (i) of the total number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding year; and (ii) shares, except before the date of any such increase, the Board may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (i) and (ii). Accordingly, on January 1, 2024, the number of shares of common stock reserved under the ESPP increased by an additional shares.

 The ESPP provides eligible employees with an opportunity to purchase shares of the Company s common stock through payroll deductions of up to of their eligible compensation, subject to a maximum of of stock per calendar year. A participant may purchase a maximum of shares of common stock during a purchase period. Amounts deducted and accumulated by the participant are used to purchase shares of common stock at the end of each purchase period. The purchase price of the shares will be of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on (i) the first trading day of the applicable offering period and (ii) the last trading day of each purchase period in the related offering period. However, in the event the fair value of the common stock on the purchase date is lower than the fair value on the first trading day of the offering period, the offering period is terminated immediately following the purchase and a new offering period begins the following day. Participants may end their participation at any time prior to the last 15 days of a purchase period and will be repaid their accrued contributions that have not yet been used to purchase shares of common stock. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment.

 The term of the ESPP purchase rights is the offering period. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company estimates volatility for ESPP purchase rights based on the historical volatility of its own common stock price. Prior to that, given the Company s limited trading history, the Company estimated volatility using the historical volatilities of a group of public companies in a similar industry and stage of life cycle, selected by management, in addition to considering the Company s own historical volatility, for a period commensurate with the term of the ESPP purchase rights. The interest rate is derived from government bonds with a similar term to the ESPP purchase right granted. The Company has not declared, nor does it expect to declare, dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of was utilized. The fair value of the Company s common stock used to value ESPP purchase rights is based on the trading price of its publicly traded common stock. 
 Employee payroll contributions accrued in connection with the ESPP were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included within accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Employee payroll contributions ultimately used to purchase shares will be reclassified to stockholders equity on the purchase date. Stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP is recognized on a straight-line basis over the offering period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of million and million, respectively, in connection with the ESPP. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and shares of the Company s common stock were purchased under the ESPP, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP was million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years.

 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Form 10-K. You should review the disclosure under the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of forward-looking statements and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments, except as required by law. 
 
 Overview 
 Our mission is to connect everyone in construction on a global platform. 
 We are the leading global provider of cloud-based construction management software, and are helping transform one of the oldest, largest, and least digitized industries in the world. We focus exclusively on connecting and empowering the construction industry s key stakeholders, such as owners, general contractors, specialty contractors, architects, and engineers, to collaborate and access our capabilities from any location, on any internet-connected device. Our platform is modernizing and digitizing construction management by enabling real-time access to critical project information, simplifying complex workflows, and facilitating seamless communication among key stakeholders, all of which we believe positions us to serve as the system of record for the construction industry. We are also continuing to develop other programs and services to address related challenges faced by the construction industry s key stakeholders. Adoption of our products, services, and platform helps our customers increase productivity and efficiency, reduce rework and costly delays, improve safety and compliance, and enhance financial transparency and accountability. 
 In short, we build the software for the people that build the world. 
 We serve customers ranging from small businesses managing a few million dollars of annual construction volume to global enterprises managing billions of dollars of annual construction volume. Our core customers are owners, general contractors, and specialty contractors operating across the commercial, residential, industrial, and infrastructure segments of the construction industry. We primarily sell subscriptions to access our products through our direct sales team, which is specialized by stakeholder, region, size, and type. 
 Our products are offered on our cloud-based platform and are designed to be easy to configure and deploy. Our users can access our products on computers, smartphones, and tablets through any web browser or from our mobile application available for both the iOS and Android platforms. 
 We generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to access our products and have an unlimited user model that is designed to facilitate adoption and maximize usage of our platform by all project stakeholders. We primarily sell our products on a subscription basis for a fixed fee with pricing generally based on the number and mix of products to which a customer subscribes and the fixed aggregate dollar volume of construction work contracted to run on our platform annually, which we refer to as annual construction volume. As our customers subscribe to additional products or increase the annual construction volume contracted to run on our platform, we generate more revenue. We do not provide refunds for unused construction volume, or charge customers based on consumption or on a per-project basis. Subscriptions to access our products include customer support and allow for unlimited users as we do not charge a per-seat or per-user fee. Customers can invite all project participants to engage with our platform as part of a project team, including customers employees and collaborators, who are other project participants who engage with our platform but do not pay us for such use. Further, multiple stakeholders can be customers on the same project and retain access to project information for the duration of their subscription.

 Certain Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Acquiring New Customers and Retaining and Expanding Existing Customers Use of Our Platform 
 We believe that the market for our platform is large, and we are highly focused on our long-term growth. Our ability to generate revenue, continue to grow our business, and serve the broader needs of the construction industry depends on our ability to efficiently acquire new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our products, services, and platform, and maintain or increase the pricing of our products and services. We drive new customer acquisitions by investing across our sales and marketing engine to engage prospective customers, increase brand awareness, and drive adoption of our products, services, and platform. We drive retention of existing customers and expansion of their use of our products, services, and platform by focusing on our customers success. 
 To support these efforts, in July 2024 we began to evolve our GTM operating model by, among other things, transitioning to a general manager model, with general managers for our North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Middle East regions and our public sector business, each of whom will be empowered to assess and deploy the appropriate strategies and tactics for customers within their respective regions. As another example, we are also adding new product and technical specialists to our GTM teams, who we believe can add value for our customers by matching the evolving needs of our customers diverse buyer personas with our products and services, and helping our customers understand and implement the full potential of our platform. Evolving our GTM operating model involves new investment, particularly as we increase our sales headcount, ramp and invest in additional enablement for our sales teams, and add the new specialists to our teams. We believe that these investments will allow us to build stronger and deeper customer relationships and improve our operating efficiency over time which, in turn, will result in better customer experiences and provide additional value to our customers, some of whom continue to face macroeconomic and other pressures that have negatively impacted their spending decisions. We anticipate some disruptions and adverse impacts to our financial and operating results in the near-term as we invest in and implement the evolved GTM operating model. Over the longer term, if we fail to successfully implement, or realize the benefits of, our evolved GTM operating model, or otherwise fail to acquire new customers, retain existing customers, or expand existing customers use of our products, services, and platform, our business, financial condition, and operating results will be adversely impacted, potentially materially. Notwithstanding these risks, we believe that implementing the evolved GTM model will improve our long-term operating efficiency, best position us for sustainable long-term growth, and enhance our ability to capture our large market opportunity. 
 
 Despite macroeconomic challenges, we have seen an increase in the number of customers that contributed more than 100,000 of annual recurring revenue ("ARR"), which increased from 1,921 as of September 30, 2023 to 2,261 as of September 30, 2024, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 18 . The number of customers on our platform has increased from 16,067 as of September 30, 2023 to 16,975 as of September 30, 2024, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 6 . All aforementioned customer counts exclude customers acquired from business combinations that do not have standard Procore annual contracts. 
 In addition, our gross retention rate GRR was 94 and 95 as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Our GRR reflects only customer losses and does not reflect customer expansion or contraction. We believe our high GRR demonstrates that we serve a vital role in our customers operations, as the vast majority of our customers continue to use our products and platform and to renew their subscriptions. We believe that GRR is a key metric to understand our ability to retain our customer base, to evaluate whether our products and platform are addressing our customers needs throughout the year. 
 To calculate GRR at the end of a particular period, we first calculate our ARR from the cohort of active customers at the end of the period 12 months prior to the end of the period selected. We define ARR at the end of a particular period as the annualized dollar value of our subscriptions from customers as of such period end date. For multi-year subscriptions, ARR at the end of a particular period is measured by using the stated contractual subscription fees as of the period end date on which ARR is measured. For example, if ARR is measured during the first year of a multi-year contract, the first-year subscription fees are used to calculate ARR. ARR at the end of a particular period includes the annualized dollar value of subscriptions for which the term has not ended, and subscriptions for which we are negotiating a subscription renewal. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP or U.S. GAAP and does not represent our U.S. GAAP revenue on an annualized basis. ARR is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue. We then calculate the value of ARR from any customers whose subscriptions terminated and were not renewed during the 12 months preceding the end of 
 27

 the period selected, which we refer to as cancellations. We then divide (a) the total prior period ARR minus cancellations by (b) the total prior period ARR to calculate GRR. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 Our subscriptions typically have a term of one to three years. The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations RPO under our subscriptions represents the contracted transaction price that has not yet been recognized as revenue, which includes deferred revenue and amounts under non-cancelable subscriptions that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Our current RPO cRPO represents future revenue under existing contracts that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. 
 The following table presents our cRPO and non-current RPO at the end of each period: 
 September 30, Change 2024 2023 Dollar Percent (dollars in thousands) Remaining performance obligations Current 738,856 635,000 103,856 16 Non-current 334,560 255,381 79,179 31 Total remaining performance obligations 1,073,416 890,381 183,035 21 
 We believe that cRPO is a key metric to track our ability to win fixed revenue commitments from new customers and to expand and retain existing customers. As of September 30, 2024, cRPO increased by 103.9 million, or 16 , year-over-year. Approximately 5 of the increase was attributable to existing customers and 95 was attributable to new customers acquired during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. We expect RPO to change from period to period primarily due to the size, timing, and duration of new customer contracts and customer renewals. 
 Continued Technology Innovation and Strategic Expansion of Our Products and Services 
 We plan to continue to invest in technology innovation and product development to enhance the capabilities of our platform. Additional features and products will also enable customers and collaborators to manage new workflows on our platform and allow us to attract a broader set of stakeholders. We have introduced and continue to develop new products and services organically and through our acquisitions. 
 We intend to continue to invest in building additional products, offerings, features, and functionality that expand our capabilities and facilitate the extension of our platform. For example, in May 2024, we acquired Intelliwave Technologies Inc., a construction materials management company that enhances our Workforce Management solution; in September 2023, we acquired Unearth Technologies Inc., a geographic information systems asset management platform that helps general contractors and infrastructure providers connect assets, data, and field teams; and in September 2023, we launched Procore Pay, a payments solution that handles all aspects of the payment processes between general contractors and subcontractors. We also intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and investments in businesses and technologies to drive product and market expansion. While the impact of these developments, including Procore Pay, are not yet material to our business, our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop or acquire, market, and sell existing and new products and services to both new and existing customers. 
 International Growth 
 We see international expansion as a major, and largely greenfield, opportunity for growth as we look to capture a larger part of the worldwide construction market. We have an international sales and marketing presence with offices in Sydney, Australia; Toronto, Canada; London, England; Paris, France; Dublin, Ireland; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates UAE ). We have also developed focused sales and marketing efforts in Germany, where we do not maintain an office location. As a result of our international efforts, we support multiple languages and currencies. Non-U.S. revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was 15 and 14 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively . We determine the percentage of non-U.S. revenue based on the billing location of each customer. Fluctuations in foreign currencies may positively or negatively impact the amount of revenue that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. 
 Furthermore, we believe global demand for our products, services, and platform will continue to increase as we expand our international sales and marketing efforts, and the awareness of our products, services, and platform grows. However, our ability to conduct our operations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, currencies, cultures, customs, and commercial markets, as well as differing legal, tax, regulatory, and alternative dispute systems. We have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in international markets. While these investments may adversely affect our operating results in the near term, we believe they will contribute to our long-term growth. 
 Macroeconomic Factors 
 Macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, such as trends within the commercial construction industry, elevated inflation, higher interest rates than we ve seen in recent history, volatility in capital markets, bank failures, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, global pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and wars and other conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine war) may impact our customers spending, as well as our operating expenses and cash flows. We believe that macroeconomic factors have resulted in cautious customer spending, contributing to the decline in our cRPO annual growth rate. However, as such factors evolve, we continue to monitor the ways in which they may directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, of our 2023 Form 10-K for further discussion.

 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to access our products and related support. Subscriptions are sold for a fixed fee and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription. Our subscriptions generally have annual or multi-year terms, are typically subject to renewal at the end of the subscription term, and are non-cancelable. To the extent we invoice our customers in advance of revenue recognition, we record deferred revenue. Consequently, a portion of the revenue that we report each period is attributable to the recognition of revenue previously deferred related to subscriptions that we entered into during previous periods. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue primarily consists of personnel-related compensation expenses for our customer support team, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, commissions, and bonuses. Additionally, cost of revenue includes non-personnel-related expenses, such as third-party hosting costs, amortization of capitalized software development costs related to our platform, amortization of acquired technology intangible assets, software license fees, and allocated overhead. Cost of revenue also includes severance costs incurred related to the restructuring event in January 2024, which is described in Note 14 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We expect our cost of revenue to increase on an absolute dollar basis as our revenue and acquisition activities increase. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in platform hosting, customer support, and software development as we grow our business, evolve our GTM operating model, and ensure that our customers are realizing the full benefit of our products. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future. 
 Costs related to the development of internal-use software for new products and major platform enhancements are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the developed software s estimated useful life of two years and the amortization is recorded in cost of revenue. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. For each of these categories of expense, personnel-related compensation expenses are the most significant component, which include salaries, stock-based compensation, commissions, benefits, payroll taxes, bonuses, and severance expenses as a result of the restructuring event in January 2024, which is described in Note 14 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses for our sales and marketing organizations. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses include non-personnel-related expenses, such as advertising costs, marketing events, travel, trade shows, and other marketing activities; contractor costs to supplement our staff levels; consulting services; amortization of acquired customer relationship intangible assets; and allocated overhead. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, as our business continues to grow, as we evolve our GTM operating model, and as we increase our investment in sales and marketing to drive customer growth. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses for our engineering, product, and design teams. Additionally, research and development expenses include non-personnel-related expenses, such as contractor costs to supplement our staff levels; computer software expenses; consulting services; amortization of certain acquired intangible assets used in research and development activities; and allocated overhead. We expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future as we continue to build, enhance, maintain, and scale our products, services, and platform.

Table of Contents 

 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses for our information technology, human resources, finance, legal, executive, and other administrative functions. Additionally, general and administrative expenses include non-personnel-related expenses, such as professional fees for audit, legal, tax, and other external consulting services; computer software expenses; costs associated with operating as a public company, including insurance costs, professional services, investor relations, and other compliance costs; property and use taxes; licenses; travel and entertainment costs; and allocated overhead. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as our business continues to grow, including in relation to our international expansion. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our money market funds, cash savings accounts, and marketable securities. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of costs associated with our finance leases. 
 Accretion Income, Net 
 Accretion income, net consists of accretion of discounts, net of amortization of premiums, related to our available-for-sale marketable debt securities. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Other expense, net primarily consists of unrealized gains or losses on equity securities, gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, and miscellaneous other income and expenses. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes of U.S. state franchise taxes and certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. As we expand our international operations, we expect to incur increased foreign tax expenses. We have a full valuation allowance for net U.S. deferred tax assets. The U.S. valuation allowance primarily includes net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits related primarily to research and development for our operations in the U.S. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for our net U.S. deferred tax assets for the foreseeable future.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue increased by 48.0 million, or 19 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, of which approximately 89 was attributable to revenue from existing customers and approximately 11 was attributable to revenue from new customers acquired during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in revenue from existing customers includes the net benefit of a full quarter of subscription revenue in the third quarter of 2024 from customers that were newly acquired or expanded their subscriptions between the beginning of the third quarter of 2023 and the end of the second quarter of 2024 and continued or expanded their subscriptions, as applicable, in the third quarter of 2024.

 The increase in cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a 4.9 million increase in amortization of capitalized software development costs. The increase in cost of revenue was also attributable to a 2.6 million increase in third-party cloud hosting and related services as we grow our customer base; a 2.3 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including increases of 2.0 million in salaries and wages and 0.3 million in stock-based compensation expense; and a 1.2 million increase in amortization of developed technology intangible assets. We decreased our cost of revenue headcount by 6 since September 30, 2023, as we continue to focus on improving operating efficiency.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe certain non-GAAP measures, as described below, are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use this non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, is helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and may assist in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. 
 The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies since other companies may calculate such non-GAAP financial measures differently, and non-GAAP financial measures exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Unlike stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll tax related to employee stock transactions is a cash expense that we will continue to incur in the future. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Table of Contents 

 Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, Non-GAAP Income from Operations, and Non-GAAP Operating Margin 
 We define these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective GAAP measures, excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, employer payroll tax related to employee stock transactions, and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin is the ratio calculated by dividing non-GAAP gross profit by total revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin is the ratio calculated by dividing non-GAAP income from operations by total revenue. 
 Stock-based compensation expense includes the net effects of capitalization and amortization of stock-based compensation expense related to capitalized software and cloud-computing arrangement implementation costs. Stock-based compensation expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company s non-cash expenses, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows for meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period. The expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets is dependent upon estimates and assumptions, which can vary significantly and are unique to each asset acquired; therefore, we believe that non-GAAP measures that adjust for the amortization of acquired intangible assets provide investors a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on restricted stock unit settlements, option exercises, related stock price, and other factors that are beyond our control and that do not correlate to the operation of our business. When evaluating the performance of our business and making operating plans, we do not consider these items (for example, when considering the impact of equity award grants, we place a greater emphasis on overall stockholder dilution than the accounting charges associated with such grants). Since the amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is highly variable due to factors outside our control, and unrelated to our core operations, operating results, revenue-generating activities, business strategy, industry, or regulatory environment, management does not consider employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions in the evaluation of the business or in making operating plans. Accordingly, we believe this adjustment in arriving at our non-GAAP measures provides investors with a better understanding of the performance of our core business in a manner that is consistent with management s view of the business. Acquisition-related expenses include external and incremental transaction costs, such as legal and due diligence costs, and retention payments. These expenses are unpredictable and generally would not have otherwise been incurred in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations. In addition, the size and complexity of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related expenses, may not be indicative of such future costs. We believe excluding acquisition-related expenses facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry. Overall, we believe it is useful to exclude these expenses in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results period-over-period and to those of peer companies.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling 809.2 million, which were held in money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, corporate notes and obligations, commercial paper, checking accounts, and savings accounts. Our investments in marketable securities are exposed to interest rate risk; however, due to the short-term nature of our investments, we do not anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit, on an unsecured basis, totaling approximately 4.4 million to secure various leased office facilities in the U.S. and Australia. 
 Our cash sources primarily consist of cash generated from sales to our customers, maturities of our marketable securities, proceeds from employees through stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan ESPP ), and interest income on our marketable securities, money market funds, and savings account balances. 
 Our cash requirements are primarily for operating expenses, which include personnel-related costs, purchase obligations primarily for hosting and software license and other services, lease obligations, and capital expenditures for our employees and offices. We also fund investments which help drive our strategic business growth through acquisitions and investments in equity securities and limited partnership funds. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating lease commencements and modifications resulted in increases of 10.7 million in future rent commitments through 2036, relating to the office lease in Austin, Texas, which were modified to extend the lease terms and adjust the rent obligations. There have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations from those discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months. While we have generated positive cash flows from operations in recent years, we have continued to generate losses from operations, as reflected in our accumulated deficit of 1.2 billion as of September 30, 2024. We may not achieve profitability in the foreseeable future and may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business. 
 This assessment is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Our additional future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, new customer acquisition and subscription renewal activity, timing of billing activities, our ability to integrate the companies or technologies we acquire and realize strategic and financial benefits from our investments and acquisitions, other strategic transactions or investments we may enter into, the volume and timing of any stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, the timing and extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, general and administrative expenses to support our growth, including international expansion, and inflation. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund these activities. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or on acceptable terms, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

 Operating Activities 
 Our largest source of cash from operating activities is collections from the sales of subscriptions to our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel expenses, marketing expenses, hosting and software license expenses, and overhead. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 167.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which resulted from a net loss of 43.7 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 201.7 million and a net cash inflow of 9.0 million from changes in operating expenses and liabilities. The 9.0 million of net cash inflows provided as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflected the following: 
 a 34.3 million decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to timing of billings and cash receipts from customers; and 
 a 11.0 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of cash payments to our vendors. 
 These changes in our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by the following: 
 a 12.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to timing of cash payments to our vendors; 
 a 8.5 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to the size and timing of bonus and commission accruals and payouts, accrued ESPP contributions, payroll, and cash payments to our vendors; 
 a 6.3 million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to timing of billings and seasonality; 
 a 6.2 million decrease in operating lease liabilities related to lease payments; and 
 a 3.2 million increase in deferred contract cost assets related to commissions as a result of additional customer contracts closed during the period. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 51.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which resulted from a net loss of 160.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of 194.1 million and net cash inflows of 17.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The 17.4 million of net cash inflows provided as a result of changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflected the following: 
 a 29.1 million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to the growth of our business and timing of billings; 
 a 3.1 million decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to timing of billings and cash receipts from customers; and 
 a 2.3 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of cash payments to our vendors.

 These changes in our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by the following: 
 a 8.2 million decrease in operating lease liabilities related to lease payments; 
 a 5.1 million increase in deferred contract cost assets related to commissions as a result of additional customer contracts closed during the period; 
 a 2.0 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to the size and timing of bonus and commission accruals and payouts, accrued ESPP contributions, payroll, and cash payments to our vendors; and 
 a 1.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to the acceleration of acquisition-related expenses associated with cash retention payments, which had been paid in advance, upon the departure of certain employees from our previous acquisitions; 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 108.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of cash outflows for purchases of marketable securities of 410.6 million, capitalized software development costs of 32.5 million, business combinations of 25.9 million, purchases of property and equipment of 7.5 million primarily related to computer equipment purchases and improvements to our leased offices, asset acquisitions of 3.8 million, and purchases of strategic investments of 1.9 million. Such outflows were partially offset by 371.7 million in maturities of marketable securities and 1.6 million of customer repayments for materials financing. 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 58.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of purchases of marketable securities of 309.3 million, capitalized software development costs of 25.2 million, originations for materials financing of 23.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of 8.1 million primarily related to improvements to our leased offices and computer equipment purchases, and asset acquisitions of 6.0 million partially offset by 287.6 million in maturities of marketable securities, 21.1 million of customer repayments for materials financing, and 5.5 million in sales of marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 22.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 13.2 million in proceeds from employee purchases under the ESPP and 12.4 million in proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by 1.6 million in payments on our finance lease obligations, 1.5 million in payments for deferred business combination consideration, and 0.1 million in payments for deferred asset acquisition consideration. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 26.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 13.0 million in proceeds from employee purchases under the ESPP and 15.1 million in proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by 1.5 million in payments on our finance lease obligations. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On October 29, 2024, our board of directors (the Board authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 300.0 million of our outstanding common stock. We intend to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time through the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), or other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, in each case, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. The timing of stock repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities, and will be subject to the discretion of our management within its authorization. The stock repurchase program will be funded using our working capital. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular number of shares of our common stock, or any shares at all. The stock repurchase program expires on October 29, 2025, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without notice.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates are those accounting policies and estimates that are both the most important to the portrayal of our net assets and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the nature of the estimates is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial condition or operating performance is material. 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies and more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to these policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency and Exchange Risk 
 The vast majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. Dollars, with the remainder denominated in Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Great British Pounds, Euros, Singapore Dollars, and UAE Dirham. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the U.S., Australia, Canada, England, Egypt, Singapore, France, Ireland, Czech Republic, Costa Rica, India, and the UAE. Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies and payment of personnel-related expenses and other operating expenses in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flow. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of 809.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist of money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, corporate notes and obligations, commercial paper, checking accounts, and savings accounts. The cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital and general corporate purposes. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of our portfolio. We therefore do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation can have a positive impact on our pricing since increased construction costs may increase construction volume purchased by customers. However, supply chain challenges and labor shortages can result in delayed construction project starts, which may negatively impact construction volume purchased. Inflation can also result in higher personnel-related costs. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Based on the Company s evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter. There have not been any changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 (c) Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flow. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties set forth below and described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties set forth below and described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of such risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 
 We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will enhance stockholder value, stock repurchases could affect the price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves, and any failure to repurchase our common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively affect the price of our common stock. 
 On October 29, 2024, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 300.0 million of our outstanding common stock. We intend to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time through the open market (including via pre-set trading plans), or other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, in each case, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. The timing of stock repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities, and will be subject to the discretion of our management within its authorization. The stock repurchase program will be funded using our working capital. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular number of shares of our common stock, or any shares at all. The stock repurchase program expires on October 29, 2025, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without notice. 
 Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may increase above the levels at which we deem it prudent to repurchase shares, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce our ability to properly manage the program and the overall effectiveness of the program. The stock repurchase program could also affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility. The existence of our stock repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Repurchasing our common stock reduces the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments, other business opportunities, and other general corporate projects. We cannot guarantee that the stock repurchase program will be fully or partially consummated. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us, or our stock price. For these and other reasons, we may fail to realize the anticipated value of the stock repurchase program or enhance long-term stockholder value as a result of the stock repurchase program.

 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On October 29, 2024, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 300.0 million of our outstanding common stock. We intend to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time through the open market, or other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, in each case, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans to facilitate repurchases of our common stock under this authorization. The timing of stock repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities, and will be subject to the discretion of our management within its authorization. The stock repurchase program will be funded using our working capital. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular number of shares of our common stock, or any shares at all. The stock repurchase program expires on October 29, 2025, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without notice. 
 Insider Trading Arrangements 
 During the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) or the contracts, instructions, or written plans for the purchase of sale of our securities as set forth in the table below.
