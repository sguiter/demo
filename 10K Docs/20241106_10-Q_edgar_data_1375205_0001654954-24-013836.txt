Exhibits 42 SIGNATURES 43 2 Table of Contents When we use the terms Ur-Energy, we, us, or our, or the Company we are referring to Ur-Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. Throughout this document we make statements that are classified as forward-looking. Please refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section below for an explanation of these types of assertions. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information This report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of applicable United States U.S. and Canadian securities laws, and these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "may," "potential," "intends," "plans" and other similar expressions or statements that an action, event or result "may," "could" or "should" be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative thereof or other similar statements. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Such statements include, but are not limited to: (i) the ability to maintain safe and compliant operations at Lost Creek; (ii) the continued schedule for ramp-up at Lost Creek to reach budgeted production, including the ability to overcome continuing challenges of ramp-up and to meet our production guidance; (iii) our ability to reach and sustain steady state higher production levels at Lost Creek in a timely and cost-effective manner; (iv) development and construction priorities and timelines for Shirley Basin, and whether our current projections for buildout can to be achieved with respect to budget and timelines; (v) the ability to complete additional favorable uranium sales agreements; (vi) our ability to timely deliver into our contractual obligations with Lost Creek production and other available sources; (vii) the timing and outcome of final regulatory approvals of the amendments for uranium recovery at the LC East Project; (viii) continuing supply-chain and labor market challenges, and whether the Company will continue to anticipate and overcome such challenges; (ix) the effects of the current evolving uranium market, including supply and demand, and whether higher spot and term pricing will be sustained including from demands of big data and new governmental programs in the U.S.; and (x) what impacts the ban on Russian uranium and fuel purchasers objectives for energy security will have on the uranium market and on what timeline. Additional factors include, among others, the following: future estimates for production; capital expenditures; operating costs; mineral resources, grade estimates and recovery rates; market prices; business strategies and measures to implement such strategies; competitive strengths; estimates of goals for expansion and growth of the business and operations; plans and references to our future successes; our history of operating losses and uncertainty of future profitability; status as an exploration stage company; the lack of mineral reserves; risks associated with obtaining permits and other authorizations in the U.S.; risks associated with current variable economic conditions; the possible impact of future debt or equity financings; the hazards associated with mining production operations; compliance with environmental laws and regulations; wastewater management; the possibility for adverse results in potential litigation; uncertainties associated with changes in law, government policy and regulation; uncertainties associated with a Canada Revenue Agency or U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit of any of our cross border transactions; changes in size and structure; the effectiveness of management and our strategic relationships; ability to attract and retain key personnel and management; uncertainties regarding the need for additional capital; sufficiency of insurance coverages, bonding surety arrangements, and indemnifications for our inventory; uncertainty regarding the fluctuations of quarterly results; foreign currency exchange risks; ability to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. securities laws outside the U.S.; ability to maintain our listing on the NYSE American and Toronto Stock Exchange TSX risks associated with the expected classification as a "passive foreign investment company" under the applicable provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; risks associated with our investments and other risks and uncertainties described under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, dated March 6, 2024. 3 Table of Contents Cautionary Note to Investors Concerning Disclosure of Mineral Resources Unless otherwise indicated, all mineral resource estimates included in this report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with U.S. securities laws pursuant to Regulation S-K, Subpart 1300 S-K 1300 ). Prior to these estimates, we prepared our estimates of mineral resources in accord with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves CIM Definition Standards ). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which establishes standards for public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. We are required by applicable Canadian Securities Administrators to file in Canada an NI 43-101 compliant report at the same time we file an S-K 1300 technical report summary. The NI 43-101 and S-K 1300 reports (for each of the Lost Creek Property (March 4, 2024) and Shirley Basin Project, as amended (March 11, 2024)), are substantively identical to one another except for internal references to the regulations under which the report is made, and certain organizational differences. Investors should note that the term mineral resource does not equate to the term mineral reserve. Mineralization may not be classified as a mineral reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. Investors should also understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under S-K 1300, estimated inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies. Additionally, as required under S-K 1300, our report on the Lost Creek Property includes two economic analyses to account for the chance that the inferred resources are not upgraded as production recovery progresses and the Company collects additional drilling data; the second economic analysis was prepared which excluded the inferred resources. The estimated recovery excluding the inferred resources also establishes the potential viability at the property, as detailed in the S-K 1300 report. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. 4 Table of Contents PART I Item 1.

There is a royalty on each of the State of Wyoming sections under lease at the Lost Creek, LC West and EN Projects, as required by law. We are not recovering uranium oxide U 3 O 8 within the State section under lease at Lost Creek and therefore are not subject to royalty payments currently. Other royalties exist on certain mining claims at the LC South, LC East and EN Projects. There are no royalties on the mining claims in the Lost Creek, LC North, or LC West Projects. 11 Table of Contents Ur-Energy Inc.

On October 23, 2013, the Sweetwater IDR Bond was issued, and the proceeds were in turn loaned by Sweetwater County to Lost Creek ISR, LLC pursuant to a financing agreement dated October 23, 2013 (the State Bond Loan ). The State Bond Loan called for payments of interest at a fixed rate of per annum on a quarterly basis commencing January 1, 2014. The principal was scheduled to be paid in quarterly installments commencing January 1, 2015. During the term of the State Bond Loan, the Sweetwater County Commissioners and the State of Wyoming approved two separate deferrals of principal payments during the downturn in the uranium market and our period of reduced production operations. Following those deferrals, quarterly principal payments resumed on October 1, 2022, and were scheduled to continue until October 1, 2024. On March 27, 2024, the remaining million balance due on the State Bond Loan was prepaid in full. The State Bond Loan was secured by all the assets of the Lost Creek Project. All releases of collateral have been obtained following the final repayment of the facility. The following table summarizes the Company s current debt. Deferred financing costs warrants to purchase common shares at per . In February 2023, the Company issued warrants to purchase common shares at per . Because the warrants are priced in U.S. dollars and the functional currency of Ur-Energy Inc., the parent entity, is Canadian dollars, a derivative financial liability was created. Using Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy under US GAAP, the liability created is measured and recorded at fair value, and adjusted monthly, using the Black-Scholes model described below as there is no active market for the warrants. Any gain or loss from the adjustment of the liability is reflected in net income (loss) for the period. 13 Table of Contents Ur-Energy Inc.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION Business Overview The following discussion and analysis by management is designed to provide information that we believe is necessary for an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of our operations and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and MD A contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Incorporated on March 22, 2004, Ur-Energy is an exploration stage issuer, as that term is defined by the SEC. We are engaged in uranium recovery and processing activities, including the acquisition, exploration, development, and operation of uranium mineral properties in the U.S. We are operating our first in situ recovery uranium facility at our Lost Creek Project in Wyoming. Ur-Energy is a corporation continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act on August 8, 2006. Our common shares are listed on the TSX under the symbol URE and on the NYSE American under the symbol URG. Ur-Energy has one wholly owned subsidiary, Ur-Energy USA Inc., incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado. Ur-Energy USA Inc. has three wholly-owned subsidiaries: NFU Wyoming, LLC, a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of Wyoming which acts as our land holding and exploration entity; Lost Creek ISR, LLC, a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of Wyoming to operate our Lost Creek Project and hold our Lost Creek properties and assets; and Pathfinder Mines Corporation, incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, which holds, among other assets, the Shirley Basin Project in Wyoming. Our material U.S. subsidiaries remain unchanged since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, dated March 6, 2024. We utilize in situ recovery ISR of the uranium at our flagship project, Lost Creek, and will do so at other projects where possible. The ISR technique is employed in uranium extraction because it allows for an effective recovery of roll front uranium mineralization at a lower cost. At Lost Creek, we extract and process uranium oxide U 3 O 8 for shipping to a third-party conversion facility to be weighed, assayed and stored until sold. After sale, when further processed, the uranium we have produced fuels carbon-free, emissions-free nuclear power which is a cost-effective, safe, and reliable form of electrical power. Nuclear power provides an estimated 50 of the carbon-free electricity in the U.S. Our Lost Creek Project is permitted and licensed for annual recovery of up to 1.2 million pounds U 3 O 8 . The processing facility at Lost Creek, which includes all circuits for the production, drying and packaging of U 3 O 8 for delivery into sales transactions, is designed and approved under current licensing to process up to 2.2 million pounds of U 3 O 8 annually, which provides additional capacity of up to one million pounds U 3 O 8 to process material from other sources. The Lost Creek processing facility will be utilized to process captured U 3 O 8 from our Shirley Basin Project for which a satellite plant will be built in 2025. However, the Shirley Basin permit and license allow for the construction of a full processing facility, providing greater construction and operating flexibility as may be dictated by future market conditions. Our sales deliveries in 2024 are projected to be 570,000 pounds U 3 O 8 into two of our sales agreements secured in 2022. We now have six multi-year sales agreements which together anticipate sales of approximately 5.7 million pounds U 3 O 8 between 2024 and 2030. 22 Table of Contents Industry and Market Update In the past several years, the nuclear markets have been favorably affected in many ways through greater acceptance of nuclear energy. Recently, technology and other industries operating data centers (in what is now simply being referred to as big data have realized the opportunities which exist to maintain carbon free baseload electricity while supporting the immense electric demand generated by these centers. The Electric Power Research Institute s May 28, 2024, White Paper titled Powering Intelligence, suggests that data centers are expected to consume as much as 9.1 of U.S. electricity generation by 2030 versus an estimated 4 today. The International Energy Agency stated in its Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026 report that Data centres are significant drivers of growth in electricity demand in many regions. After globally consuming an estimated 460 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2022, data centres total electricity consumption could reach more than 1 000 TWh in 2026. This demand is roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan. The use of nuclear power by big data isn t just a projection; it is already happening in a material way. Talen has already been selling significant power to big data. During the quarter, Constellation Energy announced a power purchase agreement with Microsoft for 835 megawatts of electricity. This is the largest ever power purchase agreement for Constellation and will result in the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania. While contributing 835 megawatts of carbon-free electricity to the grid, this historic project will create 3,400 jobs and offset approximately 61 million metric tons of CO 2 emissions over 20 years. Still others in big data, including Google and Amazon, have announced plans to utilize nuclear energy to satisfy these rapidly growing electrical needs. Throughout 2024, utilities and other buyers continue to identify energy security as a nearly universal priority. Ongoing war and geopolitics have only strengthened the resolve of fuel purchasers to reduce dependence on Russian nuclear products. U.S. and global utilities have increasingly been seeking non-Russian supplies when negotiating uranium term sales agreements. In the U.S., the ban on Russian imports of nuclear fuels, signed into law earlier in the year, became effective in August 2024. While allowing certain waivers until January 1, 2028, the prohibitions on imports continue through 2040. The ban will help to secure the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain and advance domestic uranium recovery operations. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has been progressing its requests for proposals under both its high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and low-enriched uranium (LEU) programs for which domestic uranium supply is preferred. In October 2024, the DOE announced it awarded contracts to Centrus Energy Corp., Orano SA, General Matter Inc. and Louisiana Energy Services (a URENCO company) to provide enrichment services to develop HALEU to fuel small modular nuclear reactors. The contracts for enrichment are worth up to 2.7 billion over the next ten years. These programs also reflect efforts by the U.S. to advance energy security; Russia has been the only potential source of HALEU. Mineral Rights and Properties We have 12 U.S. uranium properties. Ten of our uranium properties are in the Great Divide Basin, Wyoming, including Lost Creek. Currently, we control nearly 1,800 unpatented mining claims and three State of Wyoming mineral leases for a total of more than 35,000 acres in the area of the Lost Creek Property, including the Lost Creek permit area (the Lost Creek Project ), and certain adjoining properties referred to as LC East, LC West, LC North, LC South and EN Project areas (collectively, with the Lost Creek Project, the Lost Creek Property ). Our Shirley Basin Project permit area, also in Wyoming, comprises nearly 1,800 acres of Company-controlled mineral acres. Lost Creek Property During 2024 Q3 we captured 75,075 pounds, dried and packaged 71,804 pounds and shipped 67,488 pounds U 3 O 8. Although not at previously anticipated rates, these figures represent increases in production numbers compared with the captured and dried figures of earlier quarters. At quarter end, our in-process inventory was approximately 90,140 pounds, our drummed inventory at Lost Creek was 26,580 pounds, and our finished inventory at the conversion facility was 40,713 pounds U 3 O 8 . In addition to the two shipments made to the conversion facility during 2024 Q3, we made two shipments following the end of the quarter, which totaled 46,592 pounds U 3 O 8 . As we continue to work through the challenges of ramp-up at Lost Creek, we now anticipate 2024 production will be in a range between 240,000 and 280,000 pounds U 3 O 8 captured on IX resin. We expect to satisfy our remaining 2024 contractual commitments to our customers with Lost Creek production and other available sources. During the quarter, we brought Header Houses (HHs) 2-9 and 2-10 online, bringing the number of new header houses in the first three quarters of 2024 to five. HH 2-11 came online in early October. HH 2-12 is on the ground at Lost Creek, and HHs 2-13 through 2-15 are being constructed in our Casper facilities. Throughout 2024 Q3 we increased our drill rig count at Lost Creek to 15. Two of the rigs which had been deployed to Shirley Basin returned to Lost Creek in October, such that our current rig count at Lost Creek is 17. We anticipate at least three additional drill rigs will mobilize to Lost Creek prior to the end of the year. Our most recently completed deep disposal well, LCDW5, has been placed into operation, and with Lost Creek s other two deep wells, is satisfying wastewater needs. Because our incoming employees have little or no experience with uranium ISR operations, training remains a priority. As we are gaining a larger core group of staff, we continue to focus on retention as well as recruitment in efforts to stabilize our workforce. 23 Table of Contents Shirley Basin Following our announcement in early 2024 of the go decision to begin buildout of our Shirley Basin in situ recovery facility in Carbon County, Wyoming we initiated several work programs for the year. These programs have complemented our initial purchasing plan for long lead-time equipment which began in 2023. Installation of the monitor wells for the first mine unit at Shirley Basin is complete. The two drill rigs which were primarily responsible for the monitor well program have been redeployed to Lost Creek in October. We have begun to collect hydrologic data and have initiated aquifer pump testing for the first mine unit. This test program is anticipated to be completed in 2024 Q4. The hydrologic confinement at Shirley Basin is well established. The existing south access road to the site has been upgraded to an all-season road. Power supply to the satellite plant construction area has been completed and the line is energized. We are advancing the refurbishment of the pre-existing substation that serviced historic Shirley Basin operations. The septic system is installed. We have selected a contractor who has commenced renovation of existing site buildings which will be used for construction, maintenance and drill casing facilities. The office building layout has been approved and we are nearing completion of a construction agreement. Engineering related to the satellite plant, including the wastewater treatment system, is at various stages of design and layout. Steel has been rolled and welded for 15 IX columns at a fabrication facility in Casper. Construction of these columns is progressing toward expected delivery in 2025 Q3. Long-lead items remain on schedule, and we are vigilant in our review of timing for additional long- and mid-lead time purchases. We continue to expect construction at Shirley Basin to be complete in late 2025 with a pre-operation inspection by the State of Wyoming following soon after. Sales of U 3 O 8 and Sales Agreements We sold 100,000 pounds U 3 O 8 in 2024 Q3 at an average price of 61.65 per pound for proceeds of 6.2 million. We continue to anticipate that we will deliver and sell 570,000 pounds U 3 O 8 in 2024. Including the revenue received during the quarter, we expect to realize revenues of 33.1 million from our 2024 U 3 O 8 sales. Deliveries for 2025 are committed to three of our customers for a base amount of 700,000 pounds U 3 O 8 . Under these agreements, two of the three buyers may elect to flex up or down by as much as 10 of the annual base delivery quantity. Both purchasers have elected to flex up their 2025 purchases by 10 , such that we now anticipate we will deliver 740,000 pounds U 3 O 8 into our term sales agreements in 2025. Equity Financing On July 29, 2024, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 57,150,000 common shares at a price of 1.05 per common share. The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 8,572,500 additional common shares on the same terms. The option was exercised in full. Including the exercised option, Ur-Energy issued a total of 65,722,500 common shares. The gross proceeds to Ur-Energy from this offering were approximately 69.0 million. After fees and expenses of 3.8 million, net proceeds to the Company were approximately 65.2 million. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures with US GAAP financial statement presentation The following tables include measures specific to U 3 O 8 sales, product cost, product profit, pounds sold, price per pound sold, cost per pound sold, and product profit per pound sold.

We captured 75,075 pounds in 2024 Q3. Plant production at Lost Creek resumed in 2023 Q3. Drying operations encountered labor and equipment issues that reduced plant throughput in 2023 Q4. The equipment issues were addressed, and pounds dried increased in each subsequent quarter. We dried 71,804 pounds in 2024 Q3. Despite the quarterly increases, drying operations have not reached targeted levels due to maintenance and manpower issues. There were no shipments in 2023. The first shipment of U 3 O 8 to the conversion facility since the return to commercial operations was completed in 2024 Q1, when 35,445 pounds were delivered to the conversion facility. During 2024 Q2, two shipments totaling 70,390 pounds U 3 O 8 were shipped to the conversion facility. We shipped another two shipments totaling 67,488 pounds U 3 O 8 in 2024 Q3. In October 2024, we made two shipments to the conversion facility totaling 46,601 pounds U 3 O 8 . We ended the quarter with 90,140 pounds in process, 26,580 drummed pounds in the plant, and 40,713 pounds at the conversion facility. Because production rates were low during the initial ramp up period, the cost per pound to produce inventory exceeded its NRV. The NRV adjustments decreased from 2.5 million in 2023 Q4 to 1.1 million in 2024 Q1 and decreased again to 0.2 million in 2024 Q2. The NRV adjustment increased in 2024 Q3 to 0.7 million primarily due to higher production cost during the period. The cost per pound at the conversion facility increased during the quarter reflecting the higher cost per pound of the drummed inventory shipped to the conversion facility in 2024. As production and shipments continue to increase to targeted levels, we expect the cost per pound in ending inventory and ultimately the cost per pound sold to level off and then decrease accordingly. 30 Table of Contents Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 The following table summarizes the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share and per pound data): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Sales 6,400 5,752 648 11,053 12,238 (1,185 Cost of sales (5,613 (4,855 (758 (10,079 (14,310 4,231 Gross profit (loss) 787 897 (110 974 (2,072 3,046 Operating costs (12,650 (11,289 (1,361 (40,528 (20,373 (20,155 Operating loss (11,863 (10,392 (1,471 (39,554 (22,445 (17,109 Net interest income 1,220 406 814 2,288 1,079 1,209 Warrant liability revaluation gain (loss) 2,968 (7,216 10,184 4,442 (4,155 8,597 Foreign exchange gain 6 13 (7 22 335 (313 Other gain (loss), net (333 2 (335 (325 2 (327 Net loss (8,002 (17,187 9,185 (33,127 (25,184 (7,943 Foreign currency translation adjustment (23 144 (167 358 (290 648 Comprehensive loss (8,025 (17,043 9,018 (32,769 (25,474 (7,295 Loss per common share: Basic (0.02 (0.07 0.05 (0.11 (0.10 (0.01 Diluted (0.02 (0.07 0.05 (0.11 (0.10 (0.01 U 3 O 8 pounds sold 100,000 90,000 10,000 175,000 190,000 (15,000 U 3 O 8 price per pound sold 61.65 60.44 1.21 61.65 62.56 (0.91 U 3 O 8 cost per pound sold 48.91 28.04 20.87 45.82 32.38 13.44 U 3 O 8 product profit per pound sold 12.74 32.40 (19.66 15.83 30.18 (14.35 Sales Sales per the financial statements includes the U 3 O 8 sales and disposal fees.

For the year, our total sales are projected at 570,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 at an average price of 58.15 per pound and we expect to realize revenues of 33.1 million. Due to the nature of our contracts, we have a limited number of deliveries, which do not occur consistently during the year. Sales revenues are recognized when the product is transferred to the purchaser. 31 Table of Contents Cost of Sales Cost of sales per the financial statements includes U 3 O 8 costs of sales and lower of cost or NRV adjustments and consists of the following (in thousands of U.S. dollars): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change U 3 O 8 product cost 4,891 2,523 2,368 8,018 6,152 1,866 Lower of cost or NRV adjustments 722 2,332 (1,610 2,061 8,158 (6,097 5,613 4,855 758 10,079 14,310 (4,231 Excluding NRV adjustments, the cost of product sales was 4.9 million and 8.0 million, and 2.5 million and 6.2 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 100,000 pounds at 61.65 as compared to 90,000 pounds at 60.44 in the comparable 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the sales of 175,000 pounds in 2024 were at an average cost of 45.82 per pound. The sales of 190,000 pounds in 2023 were at an average cost of 32.38 per pound. The 2023 sales were made with a combination of pre-ramp up produced and purchased pounds the Company already had in its finished inventory at the conversion facility. The produced pounds were inventoried in earlier years with higher production rates and lower average costs per pound produced. The pounds sold in 2024 were primarily from more expensive post ramp up production. Cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 0.7 million and 2.1 million of NRV adjustments, respectively. Cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included NRV adjustments of 2.3 million and 8.2 million, respectively. The decrease is attributable to increased production for the respective periods. The current NRV adjustments are due to increased production costs in combination with lower than anticipated production thus far in 2024. Gross Profit (Loss) Gross profit (loss) is based on sales, which includes disposal fees, and cost of sales, which includes NRV adjustments. As we had sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a gross profit for each period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net profit from sales exceeded our NRV adjustments as the latter has been greatly reduced due to increases in production. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our initial production levels were low, which resulted in higher NRV adjustments and a gross loss for the period. Operating Costs The following table summarizes the operating costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Operating Costs 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Exploration and evaluation 934 512 422 2,862 1,687 1,175 Development (see below) 10,088 9,339 749 31,730 13,577 18,153 General and administration 1,397 1,314 83 5,418 4,738 680 Accretion 231 124 107 518 371 147 12,650 11,289 1,361 40,528 20,373 20,155 32 Table of Contents Total operating costs increased 1.4 million and 20.2 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023, respectively. The increases were mainly due to development costs at Lost Creek as the ramp up to operations began in 2023 and has continued throughout 2024. In addition, we constructed an additional disposal well at Lost Creek and initiated drilling and site construction activities at our Shirley Basin project which we expect to complete in late 2025. Exploration and evaluation expense consists of labor and the associated costs of the exploration, evaluation, and regulatory departments, as well as land holding and exploration costs on properties that have not reached the development or operations stage. The increases in cost of 0.4 million and 1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were driven by increases in outside service costs and labor costs for additional staffing. The Company is considered an exploration stage issuer and expenses its pre-production development costs. As noted above, these development costs are incurred in advance of production from the related mining areas. Development expense includes costs incurred at the Lost Creek Project not directly attributable to current production activities, including wellfield construction, drilling, and development costs. It also includes costs incurred at the Shirley Basin Project not directly attributable to the construction of the capitalizable assets of the project, including the installation of the wellfield monitor well ring and other development costs. The following table summarizes the development costs included in operating costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Development Costs 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Lost Creek mine unit development 8,675 5,217 3,458 24,999 8,849 16,150 Lost Creek disposal well development 132 3,922 (3,790 4,106 4,089 17 Shirley Basin mine development 1,281 139 1,142 2,548 503 2,045 Other development - 61 (61 77 136 (59 10,088 9,339 749 31,730 13,577 18,153 Development expenses increased approximately 0.7 million and 18.2 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increases were driven by increased drilling activities and the related wellfield construction costs that relate to the mine unit MU two development program at Lost Creek. In addition, development costs in 2023 and 2024 also included 7.7 million in direct costs primarily related to the construction of a new disposal well at Lost Creek. At Shirley Basin, we incurred approximately 1.3 million and 2.5 million development costs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Development activities at Shirley Basin included drilling costs related to the installation of the first monitor well ring. General and administration expenses relate to the administration, finance, investor relations, land, and legal functions, and consist principally of personnel, facility, and support costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the expenses increased 0.1 million and increased 0.7 million, respectively. The increases for the nine months were driven by higher labor costs, insurance costs, and stock compensation expense. Other Income and Expenses Higher interest rates and cash balances have generated significant interest income in 2024. At the same time, interest expense decreased after the Company paid off the Wyoming state bond loan in March 2024. 33 Table of Contents For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the warrant liability revaluation resulted in 3.0 and 4.4 million gains, compared to 7.2 and 4.2 million losses in 2023, respectively. As a part of the February 2021 and February 2023 underwritten public offerings, we issued warrants that were priced in U.S. dollars. The changes in liability are primarily related to the share price of the company s stock which is a significant factor in the Black-Scholes computations. Earnings (loss) per Common Share The basic and diluted losses per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 0.02 and 0.11, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 the losses were 0.07 and 0.10 per share. The diluted loss per common share is equal to the basic loss per common share due to the anti-dilutive effect of all convertible securities in periods of loss. Liquidity and Capital Resources As shown in the Interim Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents increased from the December 31, 2023 balance of 68.2 million to 129.4 million as of September 30, 2024. Cash resources consist of Canadian and U.S. dollar denominated deposit and money market accounts, and U.S. treasury fund investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent 32.5 million on operating activities, used 5.7 million on investing activities, and generated 99.3 million from financing activities. Accounts payable included 1.4 million of insurance and surety bond expenses and 0.6 million in equipment purchases at September 30, 2024. Accounts payable included 0.2 million in equipment purchases at December 31, 2023. As these did not affect cash balances at the respective dates, they have been adjusted on the Statement of Cash Flow. During the nine-month period, we sold 175,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 for 10.8 million, received 0.3 million in disposal fees, and generated 2.4 million from interest income, net of loan interest expense of 0.1 million. We spent 9.8 million on production-related cash costs, 37.0 million on operating costs, and had a 0.8 million favorable working capital movement primarily related to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Investing activities used 5.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We spent 2.8 million on construction and equipment at Shirley Basin and 2.9 million for vehicles and equipment. The vehicles and equipment will be used primarily at Lost Creek. Financing activities provided 99.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In July, we closed an equity financing by issuing 65,722,500 shares including an 8,572,000 overallotment at 1.05 per share for net proceeds after commissions and fees of 65.2 million. We received net proceeds of 27.7 million from the sale of common shares through our At Market Facility, and 12.3 million from the exercise of warrants and stock options. We spent 5.7 million on the Wyoming bond loan, ultimately paying off the loan in March 2024, and 0.2 million on lease payments. Wyoming State Bond Loan On October 23, 2013, we closed a 34.0 million Sweetwater County, State of Wyoming, Taxable Industrial Development Revenue Bond financing program loan State Bond Loan ). The State Bond Loan called for payments of interest at a fixed rate of 5.75 per annum on a quarterly basis, which commenced January 1, 2014. The principal was to be payable in 28 quarterly installments, which commenced January 1, 2015. 34 Table of Contents During the term of the State Bond Loan, the Sweetwater County Commissioners and the State of Wyoming approved two separate deferrals of principal payments during the downturn in the uranium market and our period of reduced production operations. Following those deferrals, quarterly principal payments resumed on October 1, 2022, and were scheduled to continue until October 1, 2024. On March 27, 2024, the remaining 4.4 million balance due on the State Bond Loan was prepaid in full. The State Bond Loan was secured by all the assets of the Lost Creek Project. All releases of collateral have been obtained following the final repayment of the facility. Universal Shelf Registration and At Market Facility On May 29, 2020, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. B. Riley Securities ), relating to our common shares. On June 7, 2021, we amended and restated the Sales Agreement to include Cantor Fitzgerald Co. Cantor, and together with B. Riley Securities, the Agents as a co-agent. Under the Sales Agreement, as amended, we may, from time to time, issue and sell Common Shares at market prices on the NYSE American or other U.S. market through the agents for aggregate sales proceeds of up to 50 million. The Sales Agreement was filed in conjunction with a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, effective May 27, 2020, which has now expired. On November 23, 2021, we filed a new universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC through which we may offer and sell, from time to time, in one or more offerings, at prices and terms to be determined, up to 100 million of our common shares, warrants to purchase our common shares, our senior and subordinated debt securities, and rights to purchase our common shares and/or senior and subordinated debt securities. The registration statement became effective December 17, 2021, for a three-year period. On December 17, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Sales Agreement Amendment No. 1 and together with the Sales Agreement, the Amended Sales Agreement with the Agents to, among other things, reflect the new registration statement under which we may sell up to 50 million from time to time through or to the Agents under the Amended Sales Agreement, in addition to amounts previously sold under the Sales Agreement. In February 2023, in conjunction with our underwritten public offering, we filed a prospectus supplement by which we decreased the amount of common stock offered pursuant to the Amended Sales Agreement. On June 28, 2023, we filed a new universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC through which we may offer and sell, from time to time, in one or more offerings, at prices and terms to be determined, up to 175 million of our common shares, warrants to purchase our common shares, our senior and subordinated debt securities, and rights to purchase our common shares and/or senior and subordinated debt securities. The registration statement became effective July 19, 2023, for a three-year period. On July 19, 2023, we entered into a further amendment to the Amended Sales Agreement Amendment No. 2 and hereafter the Amended Sales Agreement with the Agents to, among other things, reflect the new registration statement under which we may sell up to 50 million from time to time through or to the Agents under the Amended Sales Agreement, in addition to amounts previously sold under the Sales Agreement. Subsequently, we filed a new prospectus supplement in June 2024 under which we may sell up to 100 million from time to time through or to the Agents under the Amended Sales Agreement, including the common shares previously sold under the Sales Agreement. 35 Table of Contents For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we utilized the Amended Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of 28.6 million from sales of 16,939,825 common shares. 2023 Underwritten Public Offering On February 21, 2023, the Company closed a 46.1 million underwritten public offering of 39,100,000 common shares and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 19,550,000 common shares, at a combined public offering price of 1.18 per common share and accompanying warrant. The gross proceeds to Ur Energy from this offering were approximately 46.1 million. After fees and expenses of 3.0 million, net proceeds to the Company were approximately 43.1 million. 2024 Underwritten Public Offering On July 29, 2024, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 57,150,000 common shares at a price of 1.05 per common share. The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 8,572,500 additional common shares on the same terms. The option was exercised in full. Including the exercised option, the Company issued a total of 65,722,500 common shares. The gross proceeds to the Company from this offering were approximately 69.0 million. After fees and expenses of 3.8 million, net proceeds to the Company were approximately 65.2 million. Liquidity Outlook As of October 30, 2024, our unrestricted cash position was 110.3 million. We expect to realize revenues of 33.1 million from the sale of 570,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 to be delivered in 2024. We had 40,713 pounds of conversion facility inventory on September 30, 2024. We delivered 100,000 pounds into sales contracts in August 2024. As of October 30, 2024, we had 87,314 pounds of U 3 O 8 in our conversion facility inventory. We expect to deliver 395,000 pounds U 3 O 8 in 2024 Q4 from production at Lost Creek and other available sources. Our unrestricted cash position and expected proceeds from uranium sales are expected to cover production and development costs of the continuing ramp up of production at Lost Creek, ongoing corporate overhead, and development and construction expenditures at Shirley Basin. We expect the planned development and construction of the Shirley Basin Project in 2025 and 2026 will be funded by operating cash flow, cash on hand, or additional financing as required. We have no immediate plans to issue additional securities or obtain funding, however, we may issue additional debt or equity securities at any time. Looking Ahead With eight operational Header Houses (HHs) in MU2, we continue our ramp up toward target production levels and steady state operations at Lost Creek. To facilitate ongoing increases in production levels, we anticipate increasing our drill rig count through the end of the year to approximately 20 rigs. Fabrication of HHs 2-13 through 2-15 is in progress in our Casper construction shop and onsite construction related to these next header houses continues to advance. HH 2-15 is a newly planned production area for which we are advancing development and construction. We are also drilling in MU1 for the next phase of its production. Because of continuing challenges of ramp-up at Lost Creek, we now anticipate 2024 production will be in a range between 240,000 and 280,000 pounds U 3 O 8 captured on IX resin. 36 Table of Contents We have commitments under contracts negotiated in 2022, when the long-term price was between 43 and 52 per pound, for deliveries of 570,000 pounds U 3 O 8 in 2024 and expect to realize revenues of 33.1 million. We anticipate making our remaining deliveries of 395,000 pounds U 3 O 8 during Q4 with Lost Creek production and other available alternatives. During the quarter, uranium spot prices softened to an average of approximately 82 per pound U 3 O 8 . However, average term pricing, which has increased steadily for several years now, reached approximately 81 per pound U 3 O 8 during the quarter. Term pricing has been supported by continued requests for proposals RFPs in the market from utilities and other global fuel buyers. We have responded to the RFPs with prices commensurate with rising market conditions including increased demand for domestically produced uranium. Our contract book now includes agreements with six leading nuclear fuel purchasers, with commitments of approximately 5.7 million pounds U 3 O 8 with deliveries occurring in 2024 through 2030. Sales prices are anticipated to be profitable on an all-in production cost basis and escalate annually from initial pricing, including some market-based pricing features. We are progressing the buildout of a satellite facility at our wholly owned, fully permitted and licensed Shirley Basin Project in Carbon County, Wyoming. The buildout will nearly double our annual permitted mine production to 2.2 million pounds U 3 O 8 . At October 30, 2024, our unrestricted cash position was 110.3 million. With this strong treasury, we are well funded for continuing construction at Shirley Basin. Installation of the monitor wells for the first mine unit at Shirley Basin is complete. We have commenced the pump test program, which remains on schedule to be completed this year. Road construction is complete and the refurbishment of existing and installation of new electric infrastructure are all advancing. Renovation of existing buildings has begun. Major construction activities at Shirley Basin are expected to begin in 2025 and initial production is expected to commence in early 2026. We are pleased to be one of the few publicly traded companies that is commercially recovering uranium and working to expand our production capacity to sell into a sustained stronger uranium market. We will continue to closely monitor the uranium markets, and other developments, which may affect the uranium production industry and provide the opportunity to put in place additional off-take sales contracts. As always, we will focus on maintaining safe and compliant operations. Transactions with Related Parties There were no reportable transactions with related parties during the quarter. 37 Table of Contents Proposed Transactions As is typical of the mineral exploration, development, and mining industry, we will consider and review potential merger, acquisition, investment and venture transactions and opportunities that could enhance shareholder value. Timely disclosure of such transactions is made as soon as reportable events arise. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have established the existence of uranium resources at the Lost Creek Property, but because of the unique nature of in situ recovery mines, we have not established, and have no plans to establish, the existence of proven and probable reserves at this project. Accordingly, we have adopted an accounting policy with respect to the nature of items that qualify for capitalization for in situ U 3 O 8 mining operations to align our policy to the accounting treatment that has been established as best practice for these types of mining operations. The development of the wellfield includes injection, production and monitor well drilling and completion, piping within the wellfield and to the processing facility and header houses used to monitor production and disposal wells associated with the operation of the mine. These costs are expensed when incurred. Mineral Properties Acquisition costs of mineral properties are capitalized. When production is attained at a property, these costs will be amortized over an estimated benefit period. Development costs including, but not limited to, production wells, header houses, piping and power will be expensed as incurred as we have no proven and probable reserves. Inventory and Cost of Sales Our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on projected revenues from the sale of that product. We are allocating all costs of operations of the Lost Creek facility to the inventory valuation at various stages of production except for wellfield and disposal well costs which are treated as development expenses when incurred. Depreciation of facility enclosures, equipment, and asset retirement obligations as well as amortization of the acquisition cost of the related property is also included in the inventory valuation. Share-Based Expense and Warrant Liability We are required to initially record all equity instruments including warrants, restricted share units and stock options at fair value in the financial statements. Management utilizes the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of the warrants and stock options at the time they are issued. In addition, the fair value of derivative warrant liability is recalculated monthly using the Black-Scholes model with any gain or loss being reflected in the net income for the period. Use of the Black-Scholes model requires management to make estimates regarding the expected volatility of the Company s stock over the future life of the equity instrument, the estimate of the expected life of the equity instrument and the number of options that are expected to be forfeited. Determination of these estimates requires significant judgment and requires management to formulate estimates of future events based on a limited history of actual results. The fair value of the restricted share units is based on the intrinsic method, which uses the closing price of the common shares on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the grant. 38 Table of Contents Impairment of long-lived assets The Company assesses the possibility of impairment in the net carrying value of its long-lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. When potential impairment is indicated, management calculates the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows relating to the asset or asset group using estimated future prices, recoverable resources, operating, capital, and reclamation costs. When the carrying value of an asset exceeds the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted future net cash flows, or other measures of fair value. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any material off balance sheet arrangements such as guaranteed contracts, contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, derivative instrument obligations, or with respect to any obligations under a variable interest entity arrangement. Outstanding Share Data As of October 30, 2024, we had outstanding 364,101,038 common shares and 6,695,123 options to acquire common shares. Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk Market risk is the risk to the Company of adverse financial impact due to changes in the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments because of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents. These assets include Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar denominated certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and demand deposits. These instruments are maintained at financial institutions in Canada and the U.S. Of the amount held on deposit, approximately 0.6 million is covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, or the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, leaving approximately 128.7 million at risk on September 30, 2024, should the financial institutions with which these amounts are invested be rendered insolvent. The Company considers any expected credit losses on its financial instruments to be nominal as of September 30, 2024. Currency risk As of September 30, 2024, we maintained a balance of approximately 2.5 million Canadian dollars. The funds will be used to pay Canadian dollar expenses and are considered to be a low currency risk to the Company. 39 Table of Contents Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s financial liabilities consisted of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 7.1 million, and the current portion of lease liability of 0.3 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 118.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Interest rate risk The Company has completed a sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact that a change in interest rates would have on the net loss and considers the change to be a low interest rate risk to the Company. Commodity Price Risk The Company is subject to market risk related to the market price of uranium. Future sales would be impacted by both spot and long-term uranium price fluctuations. Historically, uranium prices have been subject to fluctuation, and the price of uranium has been and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including the demand for nuclear power, political and economic conditions, governmental legislation in uranium producing and consuming countries, and production levels and costs of production of other producing companies. The average spot market price was 80.38 per pound U 3 O 8 as of October 30, 2024. Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this MD A, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information the Company is required to disclose in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act: (1) is recorded, processed and summarized effectively and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to Company management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures include components of internal control over financial reporting. No matter how well designed and operated, internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. (b) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 40 Table of Contents PART II Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS No new legal proceedings or material developments in pending proceedings. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes from those risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None. Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE Our operations and exploration activities at Lost Creek are not subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.
