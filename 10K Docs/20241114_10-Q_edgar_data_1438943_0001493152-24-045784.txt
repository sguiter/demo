and of cash was used by the Company s
operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future,
collecting outstanding accounts receivable, and/or raising additional capital to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities
arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Company estimates, as of September 30, 2024, that it may not have
sufficient funds to operate the business for 12 months given its cash balance of 
and expected revenues to be generated by the Range Reclamation Entities. The Company is actively seeking additional financing
and other sources of capital to fund its currently estimated level of operations. However, these estimates could differ if the
Company encounters unanticipated difficulties, or if its estimates of the amount of cash necessary to operate its business prove to
be wrong, and the Company uses its available financial resources faster than it currently expects. No assurance can be given that
any future financing or capital, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to
the Company.

 expense 

See
Note 2 for more details on the change in buildings, property and equipment. 

The
Company provides for depreciation of its buildings, property and equipment using the straight-line method for both financial reporting
and federal income tax purposes over the estimated six-year useful lives of the assets. 

The
Company assesses the recoverability of its property and equipment by determining whether the depreciation of the assets over their remaining
lives can be recovered through projected future cash flows generated by the assets. There were no assets identified for impairment. 

The
fair value of the Company s stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, which uses certain
assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or restricted stock, and future
dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model and based
on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense
recorded in future periods.

operating business segments: (i) Range Reclaim; (ii) Range Minerals; (iii) Range Water; (iv) Range Security; and (v) Range Land.
Previously, beginning in October 2021, the Company began operating under two segments: (A) the Drug Development segment, which
reports the operating results of the Company s broad portfolio of glycosylated cannabinoid prodrugs operating under the name
Graphium Biosciences, and (B) the Range Reclaim segment, which reports the operating results of our land reclamation, water
restoration and incidental coal mining services to customers throughout Appalachia. The Range Water, Range Security and Range Land
business segments began operations in 2023. Beginning in January 2024, Range Minerals, which was previously reported within the
Range Reclaim operating business segment, was separately reported as its own operating business segment focused on coal mining,
using subcontractors, and related reclamation activities, and the Drug Development segment was renamed Graphium Biosciences.
Graphium Biosciences was sold in September 2024 and therefore the drug development business segment named Graphium Biosciences is no
longer reported as an operating business segment of the Company. 

In
accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC 280, the Company s chief operating decision-maker has been
identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance
for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to
report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers,
and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation
under Segment Reporting due to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products
and services; and procurement, manufacturing, and distribution processes. 

. This sale did not constitute a discontinued operation as the Company has ongoing business and is still operating
with active contracts and completion of work in progress. Only certain assets were sold and debts forgiven. 

On
September 30, 2024, the Company sold all of its common stock of Graphium Biosciences to a newly-formed entity, Placer Biosciences,
Inc. Placer owned by two former officers of the Company, in exchange for a warrant to purchase 
shares of Placer s common stock (then representing of the outstanding shares of Placer) at 
par value per share and cash proceeds of ,
with the cash proceeds reflected within Net proceeds from disposition of Graphium Biosciences in the
investing activities of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and recognized a gain on sale of ,
included within Loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The warrant to
purchase Placer s shares expires September 30, 2034. 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Range Environmental suffered a casualty loss on a piece of equipment. Insurance proceeds of
 
were received for this loss. In addition, several pieces of equipment no longer needed for current or foreseeable operations were
sold for a net price of .
The proceeds from these transactions are shown within Cash flows from investing activities and the losses from these transactions are shown within Cash flows
from operating activities on
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the biochar ovens owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Terra Preta, LLC, were dismantled since they were no longer being used for small batch biochar
production. The resulting loss is included within Cash flows from operating
activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Assets

As
previously described, assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for

Company accounted for the transaction as a business combination in accordance ASC 805 Business Combinations . The Company
has performed an allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The fair values of the assets
acquired are set forth below. Because the fair values exceeded the purchase price, a gain on the purchase of was recognized.
The allocation of the purchase price is based on management s estimates and a third-party assessment of the fair value of the equipment

months ended September 30, 2024, Collins Building s operations contributed 
revenue and a net operating loss of .
The losses stem primarily from depreciation of equipment and buildings purchased as part of the Collins Building acquisition.
Collins Building contributed 
revenue to the Company s consolidated revenues for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company
recorded the revenue generated from reclamation services on abandoned mine land, which was historically the core business of Collins
Building, as revenue of Range Environmental. A gain on bargain purchase of 
offset by

Company
Overview 

Range
is a public company dedicated to improving the health and wellness of people and the planet through a novel and innovative approach to
impact investing. We own and operate several complementary operating businesses focused on developing long-term solutions to environmental,
social, and health challenges, with a particular focus on acquiring, reclaiming and repurposing mine sites and other undervalued land
in economically disadvantaged communities throughout Appalachia. Range takes an opportunistic approach to impact investing by leveraging
its competitive advantages and looking at solving old problems in new ways. Range seeks to thoughtfully allocate its capital into strategic
opportunities that are expected to make a positive impact on the people-planet ecosystem and generate strong investment returns for its
shareholders. 

19 

Our
corporate headquarters is located in Cleveland, Ohio with an additional office location in Fola, West Virginia. As of November 13,
2024, we employed 24 full-time employees. In addition, we have, from time to time, engaged various consultants and professional
service firms to provide us with flexible and experienced resources to advance our corporate objectives in order to maintain a
cost-effective overhead structure. We strive to instill a corporate culture of honesty, integrity and respect while advancing our
mission of doing well by doing good. 

Impact
Investing Strategy 

Our
impact investing strategy aims to improve the health and wellness of people and the planet, while also generating long-term sustainable
financial returns for our shareholders. We believe that doing well and doing good are not mutually exclusive, and that an impact investing
strategy can balance the environmental, social and economic needs of people and the planet while also generating attractive risk-adjusted
financial returns for shareholders. 

Our
impact investing strategy provides an opportunity for our dedicated team to address pressing environmental, social and economic challenges,
such as air and water pollution, educational inequality and economic disparity, and climate change, through the development of technology-based
solutions. By actively directing investment capital towards businesses that are working to create positive environmental, social and
economic outcomes, we believe that our impact investing strategy can contribute to an improved people-planet ecosystem and a healthier
and happier way of life. 

We
have a particular interest in providing environmental and social solutions in economically-disadvantaged regions of the United States.
Initially, the Company is targeting the Appalachian region, which is home to communities with some of the most disadvantaged income,
education and employment demographics in the United States. Our ambitious strategy is to allocate investment capital and build operating
businesses that provide positive environmental and social impact in the disadvantaged coal communities of Appalachia to maximize the
good we can do for people and the planet. 

Operating
Business Segments 

Our
five operating business segments are: (i) Range Reclaim; (ii) Range Minerals; (iii) Range Water; (iv) Range Security; and (v) Range Land. 

Range
Reclaim 

In
May 2022, the Company acquired Range Environmental Resources, Inc., a West Virginia corporation Range Environmental ).
Range Environmental provides land reclamation and water restoration services to customers throughout the Appalachian region with the
goal of returning land to pre-mining conditions or repurposing the land for natural, commercial, agricultural or recreational use. Range
Environmental s water restoration services seek to improve the water quality of rivers, streams and discharges through novel and
innovative treatment applications to help customers meet their various regulatory standards and requirements. 

According
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA ), the United States had 551 coal mines in 2020, comprised of 370 active
mines, 141 idled or closed mines, and 40 new or activated mines. Approximately 82 of those coal mines were located in Appalachia (which
comprises the Appalachian Mountains and is commonly known as the cultural region in the Eastern United States stretching from the southern
part of New York to the northern parts of Alabama and Georgia). According to the EIA, there were approximately three times as many coal
mines in the United States in 2008 compared to 2020 with approximately 89 located in Appalachia. The precipitous decline in the number
of operating coal mines since 2008 is due to various supply, demand and regulatory factors, including a reduction in demand for coal
as a source of electricity due to the increased use of natural gas and renewable energy, an increase in coal production costs due to
inflation, the dearth of cost-effective locations remaining for mining, and a more stringent and costly regulatory environment, all of
which have resulted in an increasingly difficult market for coal producers. 

In
2000, coal was responsible for 1,966 billion kWh of electricity generation, which represented 52 of the total electricity generation
in the United States. By contrast, in 2022, coal was responsible for only 828 billion kWh of electricity generation, which represented
20 of the total electricity generation in the United States. According to the EIA, 23 of the 200,568 megawatts of coal-fired capacity
currently operating in the United States is scheduled to be retired by the end of 2029 due to the high cost of operations, continued
competition from natural gas and renewable energy resources, and sustainable initiatives of energy producers. 

However,
the reclamation of closed and inactive mine sites has not kept pace with the increase in closed and idled mine sites, thus creating a
substantial backlog of reclamation work that needs to be completed on former mine sites. According to the U.S. Office of Surfacing Mining
Reclamation and Enforcement OSMRE ), there are approximately 50,000 high-priority abandoned mine land locations in the
United States resulting from legacy coal mining operations that failed to adequately reclaim the land and waterways back to their natural
state. Additionally, there are tens of thousands of active mine sites in the United States that require contemporaneous reclamation of
land and waterways during the active mining process, and an estimated equally large number of idled mine locations that also require
significant land reclamation and water restoration services. 

20 

Under
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 SMRCA ), OSMRE was established for two basic purposes: (i) to ensure
coal mines in the United States operate in a manner that protects citizens and the environment during mining operations and to restore
the land to beneficial use following mining; and (ii) to implement an Abandoned Mine Land AML reclamation program to
address the hazards and environmental degradation resulting from two centuries of coal mining activities that occurred before SMRCA was
passed in 1977. The AML reclamation program is funded through fees levied against coal producers based on tons of coal produced. As of
September 2020, the AML reclamation fund had collected a total of 11.7 billion in coal mining fees over the life of the program, with
 9.5 billion (81 appropriated and distributed in accordance with SMCRA, and 2.2 billion (19 unappropriated and available for future
disbursement. In November 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, authorized 11.3 billion
in new funding to be appropriated for deposit into the AML reclamation fund. Importantly, the AML reclamation fund is only available
to help fund the reclamation of mines abandoned before SMCRA was enacted in 1977; therefore, all mines abandoned after the year 1977
cannot access funding from the AML reclamation fund and must obtain funding from other sources. 

While
much of the funding for this reclamation work comes from the federal government, each state in Appalachia has a Department of Environmental
Protection or an equivalent agency DEP that oversees coal mining permitting, operations, and reclamation. Under DEP rules
and regulations, coal mining companies are required to develop a mining and reclamation plan that is approved by the applicable state
agency, obtain a mining permit from the state, and secure a reclamation surety bond from a qualified third-party insurance company or
provide a comparable financial guarantee. The reclamation surety bond provides the state with financial assurances that land reclamation
and waterway restoration will be performed in accordance with the original reclamation plan once mining is complete if the coal mining
company, as primary obligor, fails to perform. Therefore, there are at least three groups who may need land reclamation, water restoration
and environmental auditing services: (i) mining companies when permits are active and reclamation bonds are not in default; (ii) surety
bond insurers when reclamation bonds are in default; and (iii) states through their AML reclamation funds for mine lands abandoned before
1977 and for mine lands with defaulted coal mining companies and surety bond insurers after 1977. 

Range Environmental currently provides reclamation and water treatment
services to one customer at one large mining complex located in Fola, West Virginia (the Fola Mine ). Range Environmental
employs 15 full-time workers and owns over 50 pieces of equipment, trucks and accessories that are used in its business operations. Occasionally,
Range Environmental will also rent or lease specific pieces of equipment for certain tasks. Range Environmental operates in a highly-competitive
market environment with high price sensitivity of customers and inflationary pressures on labor, material and supply costs, therefore
operating efficiency and asset utilization are key drivers of profitability and performance. Range Environmental uses minimal raw materials
in connection with its reclamation services at the Fola Mine, other than grass seed, trees, water treatment solutions and other related
reclamation and water treatment supplies, which are reimbursed by its customer. Range Environmental does not own any intellectual property
and does not require any government approvals to provide reclamation services at the Fola Mine, other than standard business licenses
and safety training for workers. 

In
August 2023, the Company acquired Collins Building Contracting, Inc. Collins Building ), a West Virginia-based environmental
services business focused on performing reclamation services on AML sites throughout West Virginia. After the acquisition, the Company used Range Environmental employees to
perform reclamation services on AML sites using Range Environmental equipment and Collins Building equipment. The Company subsequently
determined that AML reclamation work was more administratively and operationally challenging than anticipated, and that the Company was
devoting a disproportionate amount of time, capital and human resources allocated to these AML projects, particularly when compared to
alternative opportunities in the marketplace. In August 2024, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of Collins Building
back to its previous owner in exchange for discharge of the outstanding indebtedness incurred in connection with the August 2023 acquisition.
The Company completed its final AML jobs in early November 2024, and subcontracted its remaining three active AML jobs to the previous
owner of Collins Building as part of the August 2024 transaction. As of the date of this filing, the Company is no longer involved
in the AML reclamation business. Collins Building, along
with Range Environmental, are classified within the Range Reclaim operating business segment. 

Range
Minerals 

In
May 2022, the Company acquired Range Natural Resources, Inc., a West Virginia corporation Range Natural ). Range Natural
provided mining and reclamation services using six of its own employees and two third-party mining subcontractors for its one customer
at the Fola Mine until December 2023. Range Natural operates in a highly-competitive market environment with high price sensitivity of
customers and inflationary pressures on labor, material and supply costs, therefore operating efficiency and asset utilization are key
drivers of profitability and performance. Range Natural uses minimal raw materials in connection with its mining and reclamation services
at the Fola Mine, other than grass seed and other related reclamation supplies, which are reimbursed by its customer. Range Natural does
not own any intellectual property and does not require any government approvals to provide mining and reclamation services at the Fola
Mine, other than standard business licenses, mining operator permits, and safety training for workers. Range Natural billed its sole
customer using a rates and hours method for its own employees and a cost plus margin method for its subcontractors.
Range Natural employees used Range Natural equipment and Range Natural subcontractors used their own equipment in performing the mining
and reclamation services. In December 2023, all of the Range Natural employees were terminated and the mining equipment subsequently
sold since Range Natural was no longer directly providing mining and reclamation services at the Fola Mine. Beginning in January 2024,
Range Natural had no employees, equipment or operations, other than contracts with third-party subcontractors. 

In
January 2024, the Company separated Range Natural s results from the Range Reclaim reporting segment and included
Range Natural s results in a separate Range Minerals reporting segment. The Company believes reporting the results
of Range Minerals separately from Range Reclaim will provide better insight and transparency into the overall operational performance
of both operating business segments. 

From
January 2024 to May 2024, Range Natural engaged two subcontractors to perform mining and reclamation services for its one customer at
the Fola Mine. Range Natural was responsible for paying both subcontractors on a bi-monthly basis and then charged its customer using
a cost plus margin method. 

On
May 2024, Range Natural engaged a primary contractor to fund the bi-monthly payments due to the same two subcontractors performing mining
and reclamation services for its one customer at the Fola Mine. As of June 30, 2024, the primary contractor failed to perform and therefore
the contract was terminated. 

On
June 30, 2024, as part of the contract termination, Range Natural agreed to assume the liability due to the subcontractors in exchange
for the ownership of the coal that had been mined by the subcontractor, and all contractual relationships with third-party contractors
and subcontractors were terminated. In August 2024, Range Natural sold all of the coal that it had acquired as part of the contract termination
and subsequently paid in full all amounts due to the subcontractors. Range Natural currently has no, and has no future plans to have
any, employees, equipment, contractual relationships, or operations, and therefore intends to discontinue the Range Minerals operating
business segment beginning in 2025. 

Range
Water 

Terra
Preta, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company Terra Preta ), is a biochar product development and environmental
solutions business started by the Company in December 2022. Terra Preta is developing a novel and innovative combination of biochar,
proprietary materials and structural designs intended to create several first-of-its-kind agricultural and water filtration products
and solutions. Terra Preta s research and development efforts have been put on hold until the Company has raised additional
capital to fund the advancement of its biochar-based agricultural and water filtration products. 

21 

Biochar
is a solid, lightweight carbon-rich material produced by the thermal decomposition of organic material (such as cellulosic feedstock,
including wood and plants) using a chemical-conversion process known as pyrolysis. Carbonization pyrolysis is a chemical degradation
process that heats organic materials to produce carbon-rich biochar, liquid bio-oils, and syngas products. Since organic material is
thermally decomposed without oxygen during the pyrolysis process, combustion does not occur, so the process allows for the permanent
capture of carbon in the biochar end-product and eliminates the release of climate-damaging carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The specific
yield of biochar during the carbonization pyrolysis process depends on several variables such as temperature, heating time and heating
rate. Lower temperatures, longer heating times and lower heating rates typically yield more biochar and less bio-oil and syngas. 

Terra
Preta has been launched to build a full-cycle, carbon-negative business that reduces greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, passively
filters contaminated water without the use of harsh chemicals, and provides a fortified, nutrient-rich soil amendment to improve the
growth of agricultural products. 

Greenhouse
gases, comprised of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, and are
generally believed to result in warmer temperatures and climate change, including changing weather patterns, rising sea levels, and more
extreme weather events. Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through, among other things, the burning of fossil fuels, solid waste and
other biomass materials, and is removed from the atmosphere when absorbed by plants during the photosynthesis process. Terra Preta would seek to lease or acquire former mine land for the planting, growth and harvesting of crops to serve as the primary feedstock for our biochar production operations.
The newly planted crops would then act as a carbon sink , drawing substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
into the plants through the photosynthesis process. When the plants are harvested, biochar is produced through the carbonization pyrolysis
process and the captured carbon dioxide is permanently preserved as carbon in the biochar product for use in water treatment and agricultural
end uses. 

Pursuant
to rules adopted under the Clean Water Act of 1972 Clean Water Act ), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA has implemented various pollution control programs such as wastewater standards for industry and recommendations for pollutants in surface
waters. The Clean Water Act prohibits any party from discharging pollutants into a water of the United States unless they have a permit
issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES ), which contains limits on what a party can discharge
and establishes monitoring and reporting requirements. On mining sites, coal operators are required to sample and test their water discharges
on a regular basis to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act and applicable NPDES permits. Currently, most mining operators treat
non-compliant water with temporary holding ponds and expensive chemicals such as pH adjusters, coagulants and flocculants that require
constant reapplication to ensure compliance. Terra Preta will focus on developing a proprietary, biochar-based passive treatment system
that treats non-compliant mine site discharges to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act and NPDES permits without the need for holding
ponds or expensive chemicals. 

Sustainable
agriculture plays a critical role in the stability, growth, and diversification of our future food supply chain and the growth of plants
intended to serve as a carbon sink to reduce greenhouse gases. High-quality soil, a key condition for sustainable agriculture, requires
organic matter, microorganisms, nutrients, and optimal compaction. Subsoils with a sufficient number of air-filled pores have little
restriction to drainage and aeration, and typically are able to decompose and cycle organic matter and nutrients more efficiently. Alternatively,
soil with poor aeration leads to the build-up of carbon dioxide, reduces the ability of plants to absorb water and nutrients, and leads
to increased plant stress and root disease. To help address the ill effects of soil compaction, Terra Preta plans to develop a proprietary,
fortified biochar soil amendment that provides unique soil structuring characteristics that will allow plants to grow strong roots that
optimize the absorption of water and nutrients, thereby reducing root stress and disease. 

22 

In
December 2022, Terra Preta filed trademarks for biochar goods and services related to agricultural and water treatment applications.
In March 2023, Terra Preta filed provisional patents related to novel and innovative agricultural and water treatment solutions and
designs. Additionally, in March 2023, Terra Preta purchased two pyrolysis ovens with the capacity to produce one ton of biochar per
day to advance our research and development activities. In July 2024, the biochar ovens were dismantled since they were no longer being used for small batch biochar production. We are currently evaluating the purchase of a large continuous-process pyrolysis oven to increase the scale of our biochar
production to commercial levels once adequate funding is secured to advance this initiative. 

Range
Security 

Range
Security Resources, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company Range Security ), is an environmental security services business
started by the Company in November 2022. Range Security is focused on providing eco-friendly, technology-driven security services to
active and former mine sites, with a particular focus on locations transitioning from coal mining to next generation industries and uses.
Range Security is intended to serve as a complementary business to the Range Reclaim and Range Minerals entities. 

Mine
sites in the Appalachian region frequently comprise thousands of acres of natural habitat with valuable infrastructure and operating
assets disbursed across large tracts of land. However, many of these mine sites lack adequate broadband access or cellular service, and
therefore traditional technology-based security solutions are not available. Also, due to the large land areas and often challenging
access roads and mountainous terrain, consistent visual confirmation of the safety and security of high value assets is problematic,
and unnecessary amounts of carbon dioxide are emitted from heavy-duty trucks used to perform frequent visual security checks. Furthermore,
due to the remoteness and lack of technological options, most security services in the market fail to provide an independent verification
of the security status of a mine site and confirmation of visual security checks, resulting in a customer s uncertainty regarding
the actual security services being provided. 

Valuable
assets commonly found on mine sites requiring high-levels of security services include office buildings, coal operation facilities such
as preparation plants and loadout facilities, power stations and electrical lines, vehicles and heavy equipment, supplies and chemicals,
and spare parts and components. These high-value assets are frequently the target of theft since all or parts of these assets can be
easily removed from the mine site and sold for cash. Unfortunately, the actual damage to the operation resulting from this type of destructive
theft is frequently many times the market value of the stolen item, primarily due to the losses resulting from the down-time of operations,
the cost of repairs and replacement components, and the long-term damage to critical infrastructure that can be repurposed and used to
attract next generation industries once the mining is complete. 

In
March 2023, Range Security was engaged by its first customer for environmental security services covering a 13,000-acre coal mine
site in West Virginia. As of November 13, 2024, Range Security employed 8 security professionals, and is focusing its recruitment
efforts on military veterans, police officers, and other professionals with security experience. Range Security has purchased two
fuel-efficient utility task vehicles for ground surveillance and a thermal-imaging drone for aerial surveillance, all of which use
significantly less fuel and electricity to operate than traditional security vehicles and provide a much broader coverage range with
a substantially lower carbon footprint. Range Security is also in the process of establishing satellite-based wireless service to
support video surveillance and enable a mobile technology solution used by our security professionals to provide real-time evidence
of visual security checks. Range Security plans to expand its security service business to additional mine sites, with a particular
focus on locations with valuable infrastructure being repurposed into non-coal multi-use complexes with attractive job growth
prospects and next generation industry opportunities.

Range
Land 

Range
Land, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company Range Land ), is a land acquisition company started by the Company in August
2023. Range Land is focused on acquiring former mine lands with the goal of reclaiming and repurposing the sites for non-fossil fuel
uses, including commercial, industrial, residential and recreational developments. Range Land is specifically focused on acquiring land
to be used for renewable energy facilities, innovative agricultural installations, and projects focused on improving the quality and
condition of our air, land and waterways. 

According
to industry estimates, Appalachia contains nearly one million acres of abandoned, idled and non-performing mine sites that are burdened
with significant land reclamation and water restoration obligations. Many of these troubled mine sites are subject to mining permits
and associated reclamation bonds, which as a result, prevents the land from being repurposed for non-mining uses until the land has been
reclaimed and the permits and bonds have been released by the applicable state s environmental protection department. Water quality
is a particularly challenging issue since a permit can only be released if the site has at least 12-months of compliant water samples
without active chemical treatment, which heightens the need for water restoration solutions to help transition former mine land to economically
viable non-mining uses. 

The
Company has assembled the internal resources and capabilities to reclaim land, restore waterways, install innovative water treatment
solutions, and secure the mine site to protect the significant historical investment in infrastructure. In addition, the Company has
extensive knowledge and expertise regarding the permit and bond release process, which is a critical step necessary to unlock the underlying
value of the former mine land for non-fossil fuel uses. Range Land is actively reviewing several mine sites throughout Appalachia to
acquire, reclaim and repurpose in order to improve the land and create non-fossil fuel economic development opportunities for disadvantaged
local coal communities. 

In
September 2023, Range Land, through its wholly-owned subsidiary CLV Azurite Land, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company CLV
Azurite ), acquired over 1,900 acres of surface interest at an idled mine complex in West Virginia. CLV Azurite is in active discussions
with the holder of the permits and bonds associated with the acquired land to ensure that the acquired surface acreage can be repurposed
for alternative non-fossil fuel uses. Concurrently, CLV Azurite is in active discussions with two experienced and well-capitalized solar
developers to convert the former mine land into a large solar energy facility on a majority of the acquired surface acreage, as well
as additional acreage for commercial, industrial, recreational and residential development. Under the solar arrangements, CLV Azurite
would be the landlord and the solar developer-operator would be the tenant required to pay CLV Azurite a negotiated lease payment on
a per acre basis. 

Competition 

Our
Company is focused on a large and growing marketplace for impact investing initiatives, and therefore, is anticipated to face competition
from a variety of operating businesses and investment funds who are developing similar business plans and operating strategies to satisfy
the increasing demands of these types of investments in the marketplace. In many cases, these competitors are larger and better capitalized
operating businesses and investment funds. 

Our
Company competes on the basis of a number of factors, including our geographic focus on Appalachia, access to mission-driven energy-transition
capital, access to impact investing opportunities, strategic relationships with reclamation bond insurance companies, recruitment and
retention of key personnel, market share with key customers, and supply relationships with critical vendors. Our ability to continue
to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. 

Information
Systems 

In
2023, the Company engaged Foundation Software, LLC Foundation Software as its new accounting software provider and converted
all of the Company s accounting system operations from QuickBooks to Foundation Software during the second quarter of 2023. 

Founded
in Cleveland, Ohio in 1985, Foundation Software is specifically designed for service companies, particularly those in the construction,
contracting and reclamation industries. Foundation Software offers the Company several enhanced features critical to the successful execution
of its shareholder value creation plan, including: (i) general ledger accounting, including accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory
and customer billing; (ii) equipment tracking on job sites, maintenance, utilization and depreciation; (iii) employee tracking on job
sites, time and materials, utilization, and billing; (iv) job costing and profitability reporting segmented by customers, job types and
location and (v) numerous real-time management dashboard and key performance indicator reports that will allow management to closely
monitor financial and operational performance and quickly react to business opportunities and issues. Furthermore, Foundation Software
will allow the Company to quickly scale operations and efficiently and cost-effectively support the anticipated growth of each business,
thereby preventing our accounting and management systems from becoming a limiting factor to our growth initiatives.

Results
of Operations 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

The
Company s revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,171,655, its gross loss was 392,928 and net loss from continuing
operations was 4,743,323. The Company s revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 5,455,633, its gross profit
was 2,857,766 and net income from continuing operations was 3,545,015. The 3,283,978 reduction in quarterly revenue was due to a 3,279,635
reduction in revenue from the Range Reclaim and Range Minerals business segments. A significant portion of that reduction is attributable
to a one-time project that contributed 2,355,000 of revenue to Range Reclaim in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Range Minerals 
revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was lower by 984,790 due the termination of its subcontractor mining arrangement on
June 30, 2024, with the only sales in the Range Minerals segment related to the sale of coal inventory that was acquired as part of a
settlement with its mining subcontractor on June 30, 2024. Range Security revenue was lower by 4,343 due to a slight variation in hours
worked in the quarter during September 30, 2024. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 473,942 compared to 1,057,055 incurred for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. This 583,113 decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to reduced employees,
consultants, and legal fees related to the Range Reclaim and Range Minerals business segments. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred net other expenses in the amount of 3,873,498 compared to net other
income of 1,744,304 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The loss in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable
to the 3,043,799 loss on the sale of the Collins Building assets, and the 707,881 loss on other asset disposals. The net other income for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily the result of the 1,875,150 gain on the bargain purchase recognized when the Collins Building
acquisition was closed in August 2023. State income tax expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 2,955. There was no state
tax expense incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,920,338 compared to net income of 3,404,175 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. This 8,324,513 decrease in net income was due primarily to a decrease in revenues of 3,283,978, the
 3,043,799 loss on the sale of the Collins Building assets, the 707,881 loss on other asset disposals, and the 1,875,150 gain on
bargain purchase recognized when the Collins Building acquisition was closed in August 2023 offset by lower operating expenses of
 583,113. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

The
Company s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8,431,286, its gross loss was 523,003 and net loss was 7,359,859.
The Company s revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 12,468,787, its gross profit was 4,351,869 and net profit
was 3,214,077. The 4,037,501 reduction in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to a 4,473,440 reduction
in revenue from the Range Reclaim and Range Minerals business segments primarily due to a failure of performance by a mining subcontractor
and termination of that subcontractor arrangement on June 30, 2024, which decline was partially offset by a 435,940 increase in revenue
from the Range Security business segment primarily due to its growth with its first customer and the performance of a new security services
contract at a second mine site for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

25 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 2,115,542 compared to 2,419,001 incurred for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. This 303,459 decrease in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to reduced employees,
consultants, and legal fees of the Range Reclaim and Range Minerals business segments. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred net other expenses in the amount of 4,195,826 compared to net other income
of 1,635,670 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This 5,831,496 increase was primarily attributable to 3,043,799 loss on
sale of the Collins Building assets, loss on sale of other asset dispositions of 707,881, the one-time gain of 1,875,150 recognized
in September 30, 2023 for the bargain purchase of the Collins Building acquisition, as well as increased interest expense of 252,221
offset by miscellaneous income of 47,555 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The
net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7,359,859 compared to a net profit of 3,214,077 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. This 10,573,936 decrease in net income was due primarily to (i) a decrease in revenues of 4,037,501, (ii) the 3,043,799
loss on the sale of the Collins Building assets, and the 707,881 loss on other asset disposals, (iii) the 1,875,150 gain on the bargain purchase recognized
when the Collins Building acquisition was closed in August 2023, (iv) the increase in state income tax of 59,555, and (v) increased costs
from discontinued operations of 111,472 offset by lower operating expenses of 303,459. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had total current assets of 5,105,376, comprised of: (i) cash of 244,586; (ii) accounts receivable
of 4,133,776; (iii) contract assets of 697,039; and (iv) prepaid expenses of 29,975. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total
current liabilities of 4,770,069, comprised of: (v) outstanding amounts on the lines of credit of 2,100,000; (x) accounts payable of
 1,099,753; (y) accrued expenses of 112,101, and (z) the current portion of long-term debt of 1,458,215. As a result, as of September
30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 335,307. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of 753,756.
This 418,449 decrease in working capital is the result of lower sales in the amount of 4,037,501 during the nine months ended September
30, 2024, which has resulted in a reduction of current assets of 4,619,469, and a similar reduction in current liabilities of 4,201,020. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had long-term assets of 5,336,656, comprised of: (i) net equipment assets of 3,576,338; (ii) land
of 1,008,897; and (iii) goodwill of 751,421. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had long-term liabilities of 2,403,824, entirely
comprised of long-term debt, net of current portion. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had long-term assets of 14,063,299, comprised
of: (v) net equipment assets of 11,549,689; (w) land of 1,563,797; (x) building of 188,416; (y) goodwill of 751,421; and (z) deposits
of 9,976. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had long-term liabilities of 5,250,027, entirely comprised of long-term debt, net of
current portion. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future, collecting
outstanding accounts receivable, and/or raising additional capital to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal
business operations when they come due. The Company estimates, as of September 30, 2024, that it may not have sufficient funds to operate
the business for 12 months given its cash balance of 244,586 and revenues being generated by the Range Reclamation Entities. The Company
is actively seeking additional financing and other sources of capital to fund its currently estimated level of operations. However, these
estimates could differ if the Company encounters unanticipated difficulties, or if its estimates of the amount of cash necessary to operate
its business prove to be wrong, and the Company uses its available financial resources faster than it currently expects. No assurance
can be given that any future financing or capital, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory
to the Company. 

26 

Our
estimated total expenditures for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2025 could increase if we encounter unanticipated lower revenues
and higher expenses in connection with operating our business as presently planned. In addition, our estimates of the amount of cash
necessary to fund our business may prove to be too low, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently
expect. If we cannot raise the capital necessary to continue to develop our business, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate
some or all of our proposed operations. If any of these were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our business would fail. 

Until
such time as the Company and its operating businesses are cash flow positive, we expect to continue funding our operations, at least
in part, through equity and debt financings. However, sources of additional funds may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms,
or at all. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds or to fund, in whole or in part, acquisitions
in furtherance of our business strategy, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and the new equity or debt securities
may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, we would incur
additional interest expenses, and assuming those loans would be available, it would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
Moreover, regardless of the manner in which we seek to raise capital, we may incur substantial costs in those pursuits, including investment
banking fees, legal fees and other related costs. 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1,859,370, compared to net cash provided by operating
activities of 1,074,719 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This 2,934,089 decrease was primarily due to: (a) 10,573,936
increase in net loss that was primarily driven by reduced gross profit of 5,161,245 in our Range Reclaim and Range Minerals business
segments and increase in other expenses of 5,891,051, which was offset by (b) 6,158,257 of non-cash adjustments that was primarily
comprised of 3,751,680 non-cash loss on the sale of assets that had been purchased to support the Range Reclaim and Range Minerals business
segments, the elimination of the 1,875,150 non-cash gain on bargain purchase, and higher non-cash depreciation expense of 524,307 due
to the Company s larger investment in equipment, and (c) 1,481,590 increase in cash generated from changes in the Company s
working capital. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 430,100, compared to net cash used in
investing activities of 7,146,525 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 270,000 from the disposition of assets no longer used in the business, 160,000
from a casualty loss from a destroyed piece of equipment, and 100 from the disposition of the Graphium Biosciences business
segment. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of land, equipment purchases
and capital expenditures. Based on the Company s current corporate strategy, no additional equipment purchases are required to
execute its near-term strategic plan; however, if additional equipment is required in the future, the Company anticipates securing
such equipment through third-party equipment leases or equipment financings. Future capital expenditures required to maintain the
Company s existing equipment are anticipated to be funded with cash on hand. 

Net
Cash Provided By Financing Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows (used in) provided by
financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: 

During
 the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received aggregate proceeds of 1,000,000 from the sale of our common stock
 in a privately-negotiated transaction. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received aggregate proceeds of
 1,410,000 from the sale of our common stock in privately-negotiated transactions. 

During
 the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid 1,502,944 of our indebtedness. 

During
 the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received proceeds of 4,035,250 from long-term debt issued in connection with
 the acquisition of Collins Building, 383,202 from the issuance of long-term debt and 1,900,000 from a line of credit, offset by
 the repayment of long-term debt of 1,072,729. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that would be material to stockholders.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. 

We
regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management s
estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from the estimates made by management. 

We
believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements included in this report: 

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The more significant
estimates and assumption by management include, among others, assumptions used in valuing assets acquired in business acquisitions, reserves
for accounts receivable, assumptions used in valuing equity instruments issued for services, the valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets, accruals for potential liabilities, and assumptions used in the determination of the Company s liquidity. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Business
Combinations 

Business
combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under ASC 805, Business Combinations. This method
requires the Company to record assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition
date. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the
fair value requires management to make estimates and assumptions including discount rates, rates of return on assets, and long-term sales
growth rates. 

Goodwill 

As
referenced by ASC 350 Intangibles- Goodwill and other ASC 350 ), management performs its annual test for
goodwill at least annually or more frequently, if impairment indicators arise. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The core principle of the revenue standard
is that a company should recognize revenue by analyzing the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify
the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company primarily invoices customers
and recognizes revenue on a periodic basis for equipment and labor hours provided to a customer on a particular job based on an agreed-upon
hourly rate sheet or a fixed amount for a project. The Company also invoices customers and recognizes revenue for equipment mobilization
fees and materials and supplies required to complete a project. The Company invoices for the sales of chemicals and recognizes revenue
when the products are delivered to the customer s designated site. Costs for equipment, labor and chemicals are generally expensed
as incurred since the projects are generally short-term and not subject to a contract. The Company also invoices customers for the provision
of environmental security services on an agreed-upon hourly rate for each project. All revenue is recognized at a point in time. 

The
Company recognizes revenue from contracts for financial reporting purposes over time. Progress toward completion of the Company s
contracts is measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each contract. This method is
used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on contracts. Because of inherent uncertainties
in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change significantly within the near term. 

28 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company periodically issues stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions
for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for such grants issued and vesting based on ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation
whereby the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized for employees as compensation expense on the straight-line
basis over the vesting period. Recognition of compensation expense for non-employees is in the same period and manner as if the Company
had paid cash for the services.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not
Applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures DCPs as of the end of the fiscal quarter
ended March 31, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. 

Based
on such evaluation at the time our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was filed, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that as of March 31, 2024, our DCPs were effective at a reasonable assurance level. Subsequent to that evaluation
and as a result of the material weakness in our ICFR discussed below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Our internal control
over financial reporting did not result in the proper accounting classification of financial information and presentation which, due
to its material impact on our financial statements, we determined to be a material weakness. Therefore, on August 8, 2024, the Company
filed a Form 10-Q/A for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which corrected the accounting error of a vendor invoice that was inadvertently
recorded in April 2024 rather than the proper period of March 2024. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in Internal Control over Financial Reporting ICFR ),
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected in a timely manner. 

We
did not maintain effective controls over expense recording and accruals. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls to timely
identify and account for period cutoff and accruals to the proper period. This material weakness resulted in the restatement of our financial
statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

Remediation
Plan 

Upon
identification of the material weakness, our management developed a remediation plan to address the material weakness, which includes
updating our procedures regarding the review of expenses and accruals of expenses to the proper period. 

Our
management believes the measures described above and others that may be implemented will remediate the material weakness that we have
identified. However, the material weakness will not be considered remediated until there has been appropriate time for us to conclude
through testing that the controls are operating effectively. 

As
our management continues to evaluate and improve our ICFR, we may decide to take additional measures to address control deficiencies
or determine to modify certain remediation measures identified. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. The impact
and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from
time to time that may harm our business. We are not currently a party to and our properties are not currently the subject of any material
pending legal proceedings the adverse outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse
effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Investing in our Common Stock
involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below, under Risk
Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on August 8, 2024, as amended, or in any updates in
our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, together with all of the other information appearing in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus,
before deciding whether to purchase any of the Common Stock being offered in this prospectus. Our business, financial condition or results
of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose
all or part of your investment in the offered securities. 

The risks described in the
documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known or that we
currently deem immaterial could also materially and adversely affect us. You should consult your own financial and legal advisors as to
the risks entailed by an investment in our Shares and the suitability of investing in our shares in light of your particular circumstances.
If any of the risks contained in or incorporated by reference in this prospectus develop into actual events, our assets, business, cash
flows, condition (financial or otherwise), credit quality, financial performance, liquidity, long-term performance goals, prospects, or
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline, and you may lose
all or part of your investment. Some statements in this prospectus, including such statements in the following risk factors, constitute
forward-looking statements. See the section entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

We will need to raise substantial additional
capital to operate our business. If we cannot obtain the capital we need to continue our operations, our business could fail. 

We will need to raise additional
funds in order to continue operating our business beyond the near term. Since inception, we have primarily funded our operations through
equity and debt financings and, more recently, with operating profits. If we do issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional
funds or to fund, in whole or in part, acquisitions in furtherance of our business strategy, our existing stockholders may experience
substantial dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing
stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it would increase our leverage relative to our earnings, if any, or to our equity capitalization,
requiring us to pay additional interest expense. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, would increase our
liabilities and future cash commitments. We also may raise funds by selling some or all of our assets. Regardless of the manner in which
we seek to raise capital, we may incur substantial costs in those pursuits, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting
fees, and other related costs. 

The Company may not be able to continue as a
going concern. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 7,359,859, and 1,859,370 of cash was used by the Company s operating activities.
The Company estimates that it may not have sufficient funds to operate its business for 12 months given its cash balance, as of November
1, 2024, of approximately 334,800 and revenues being generated by the Range Reclamation Entities. The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to fund future operations through additional financing from investors and/or
lenders or through the sale of its securities or through development of its operations. Due to these and other factors, there is substantial
doubt of the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our limited operating experience could make
our operations inefficient or ineffective. 

We have only a limited operating
history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects and how we will respond to competitive, financial
or technological challenges. In addition, because of our limited operating history, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge
and affect our businesses, and limited experience responding to such trends. We may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant
business trends and we will be subject to the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in
evolving markets. We may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks and uncertainties. Failure to adequately to do
so could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer or fail. 

30 

We may not be able to manage our expansion of
operations effectively. 

Assuming we are able to attract
additional capital, we intend to expand our operations. To manage this growth, we may need to expand our facilities, augment our operational,
financial and management systems and hire and train qualified personnel. Our management will also be required to develop new relationships
with customers, suppliers and other third parties. Our current and planned operations, personnel, systems, and internal procedures and
controls may not be adequate to support our future growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take
advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures. 

If we are unable to hire and retain qualified
personnel, we may not be able to implement our business plan. 

As of November 13, 2024, we had
24 full-time employees. Attracting and retaining personnel will be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain the
qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. In addition, we may have difficulty recruiting necessary personnel
as a result of our limited operating history. The loss of key personnel or the failure to recruit necessary additional personnel could
impede the achievement of our business objectives. 

In addition, we expect to rely
on independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services. The services of these independent organizations, advisors
and consultants may not be available to us on a timely basis when needed or on acceptable terms, and if they are not available, we may
not be able to find qualified replacements. If we are unable to retain the services of qualified personnel, independent organizations,
advisors and consultants, we may not be able to implement our business plan. 

Our CEO and certain other Company employees
devote substantial portions of their time to businesses other than the Company s business. 

Certain of our officers, directors
and employees devote substantial portions of their time to businesses of other companies. Our CEO, Michael Cavanaugh, currently serves
as Chief Investment Officer of Tower 1 Partnership, LLC, an investment firm focused on private and public investments in a variety of
industries, and as the manager of several non-affiliated investment partnerships, pursuant to which he devotes a significant portion of
his time. The commitments of our officers, directors and employees to these other businesses may cause them to devote less time to the
Company than would otherwise be the case. 

Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could
result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. 

We depend on digital technologies,
including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may
deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure
of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential
data. As an early-stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against
such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability
to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business
and lead to financial loss. 

We may have difficulty accomplishing our growth
strategy within and outside of our current service areas. 

Our ability to expand our business,
both within our current service areas and into new areas, involves significant risks, including, but not limited to: 

changes in regulatory landscape reducing the demand for, and incentives relating to, our land reclamation, water treatment and related environmental services; 

receiving or maintaining necessary regulatory permits, licenses or approvals; 

downturns in economic or population growth and development in our service areas, particularly in the coal mining industry and in those agricultural and commercial businesses and real estate developments which benefit from our land reclamation and water treatment services; 

risks related to planning and commencing new operations, including inaccurate assessment of the demand for our land reclamation, water treatment and related environmental services and products and inability to begin operations as scheduled; and 

our potential inability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or to form relationships with coal mining operators or other landowners necessary to form strategic partnerships. 

31 

Operating costs, construction costs and costs
of providing services may rise faster than revenue. 

Our ability to increase the rates
at which we provide our land reclamation, water treatment and related environmental services may be limited by a variety of factors. However,
our costs are subject to market conditions and other factors, and may increase significantly. The second largest component of our equipment
operating costs is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large
components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs
may increase disproportionately to our service rate increases and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations. 

Our suppliers may fail to deliver materials
and parts according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these materials
and parts effectively. 

The equipment we use in our land
reclamation and water treatment and reclamation business contains materials and parts purchased globally from many suppliers which exposes
us to potential component shortages or delays. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, labor issues, wars such as
the current conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade
and shipping disruptions, port congestions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers control could also affect these suppliers 
ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and
effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, it may reduce our access to components
and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in delays in providing our services
and products. Our suppliers may not be willing or able to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, or to
do so may cost us more, which may require us to replace them with other sources. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional
or alternate sources for most of our necessary components or products, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or
at all or at prices that are financially feasible. 

Our financial results depend on successful project
execution and may be adversely affected by cost overruns, failure to meet customer schedules or other execution issues. 

A portion of our revenue is derived
from projects that are technically complex and that may last over many months. These projects are subject to a number of significant risks,
including project delays, cost overruns, changes in scope, unanticipated site conditions, design and engineering issues, incorrect cost
assumptions, increases in the cost of materials and labor, safety hazards, third party performance issues, weather issues and changes
in laws or permitting requirements. If we are unable to manage these risks, we may incur higher costs, liquidated damages and other liabilities
to our customers, which may decrease our profitability and harm our reputation. Our continued growth will depend in part on executing
a higher volume of large projects, which will require us to expand and retain our project management and execution personnel and resources. 

We face competition in our industry, and we
may be unable to attract customers and maintain a viable business. 

There can be no assurance that
we will be able to successfully compete with our competitors. Our competitors may be able to offer similar services which prove to be
more popular with potential customers than our services. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability will depend on our ability to satisfy
our customers and withstand increasing competition by providing superior environmental services at reasonable cost. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to achieve or maintain a successful competitive position. 

If we become subject to environmental-related
claims, we could incur significant cost and time to comply. 

Our land reclamation and water
treatment business activities create a risk of significant environmental liabilities and reputational damage. Under applicable environmental
laws and regulations, we could be strictly, jointly and severally liable for releases of regulated substances by us at the properties
of others, including if such releases result in contamination of air or water or cause harm to individuals. Our business activities also
create a risk of contamination or injury to our employees, customers or third parties, from the use, treatment, storage, transfer, handling
and/or disposal of these materials. 

In the event that our business
activities result in environmental liabilities, such as those described above, we could incur significant costs or reputational damage
in connection with the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination, and we could be liable for any resulting damages
including natural resource damages. Such liabilities could exceed our available cash or any applicable insurance coverage we may have.
Additionally, we are subject to, on an ongoing basis, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling
and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant
and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 

Further, we may incur costs to
defend our position even if we are not liable for consequences arising out of environmental damage. Our insurance policies may not be
sufficient to cover the costs of defending such claims. 

32 

Failure to effectively treat emerging contaminants
could result in material liabilities. 

A number of emerging contaminants
might be found in water that we treat that may cause a number of illnesses. In applications where treated water enters the human body,
illness and death may result if contaminants or pathogens are not eliminated during the treatment process. The potential impact of a contamination
of water treated using our products, services or solutions is difficult to predict and could lead to an increased risk of exposure to
product liability claims, increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies and negative publicity. Further, an outbreak of
disease in any one of the markets we serve could result in a widespread loss of customers across such markets. 

We may incur liabilities to customers as a result
of failure to meet performance guarantees, which could reduce our profitability. 

Our customers may seek performance
guarantees as to our equipment and services. Failure to meet specifications of our customers or our failure to meet our performance guarantees
may increase our costs by requiring us to provide additional resources and services, monetary reimbursement to a customer or could otherwise
result in liability to our customers. To the extent that we incur substantial performance guarantee claims, our reputation, earnings and
ability to obtain future business could be materially adversely affected. 

Developments in, and compliance with, current
and future environmental and climate change laws and regulations could impact our land reclamation and water treatment business, financial
condition or results of operations. 

Our business, operations, and
product and service offerings are subject to and affected by many federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations,
including those enacted in response to climate change concerns. Compliance with existing laws and regulations currently requires, and
compliance with future laws is expected to continue to require, increasing operating and capital expenditures in order to conform to changing
environmental standards and regulations, which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore,
environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions to address violations, and may require the installation
of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. We also incur, and expect to continue to
incur, costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations. At the same time, the demand for our land reclamation and water
treatment services also is driven by federal and state laws, regulations and programs which create incentives for our services. Developments
such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us
of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts,
our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments, or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in
the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our insurance may not provide adequate coverage. 

Although we maintain general and
product liability, property and commercial insurance coverage in amounts which we consider prudent, there can be no assurance that such
insurance will prove adequate in the event of actual casualty losses or broader calamities such as earthquakes, financial crises, economic
depressions or other catastrophic events, which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Any such losses could have a material
adverse effect on the performance of our systems. 

Our land reclamation and water treatment business
is subject to various statutory and regulatory requirements, which may increase in the future. 

Our land reclamation and water
treatment business is subject to various statutory and regulatory requirements. Our ability to continue to hold licenses and permits required
for our land reclamation and water treatment business is subject to maintaining satisfactory compliance with such requirements. We may
incur significant costs to maintain compliance. Our ability to obtain modifications to our permits may be met with resistance, substantial
statutory or regulatory requirements or may be too costly to achieve. These requirements may cause us to postpone or cancel our plans.
Future statutory and regulatory requirements, including any legislation focused on combating climate change, may require significant cost
to comply or may require changes to our products or services. 

The environmental regulations to which we are
subject may increase our costs and potential liabilities and limit our ability to operate. 

Our land reclamation and water
treatment business is subject to various federal, state, and local environmental requirements, including those relating to emissions to
air, discharged wastewater, storage, treatment, transport and disposal of regulated materials and cleanup of coal mining and groundwater
contamination. Efforts to conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including environmental rules
and regulations, require programs to promote compliance, such as training employees and customers, purchasing health and safety equipment
and in some cases hiring outside consultants and lawyers. Even with these programs, we face the risk of being subject to government enforcement
proceedings, which can result in fines or other sanctions and require expenditures for remedial work on contaminated sites. The landscape
of environmental regulation to which we are subject can change. Changes to environmental regulation often present new business opportunities
for us; however, such changes may also result in increased operating and compliance costs. While we seek to monitor the landscape of environmental
regulation, our ability to navigate is limited by our small size and resources, and any changes to such regulations may result in a material
effect on our operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

33 

Regulators also have the power
to suspend or revoke permits or licenses needed for operation of our equipment and vehicles based on, among other factors, our compliance
record, and customers may decide not to do business with us because of concerns about our compliance record. Suspension or revocation
of permits or licenses would impact our land reclamation and water treatment business and could have a material impact on our financial
results. Although we have never had any of our operating permits revoked, suspended or non-renewed involuntarily, it is possible that
such an event could occur in the future. 

Certain environmental laws and
regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination
at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Investigations undertaken in connection with these
activities may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated, and closures of facilities might trigger compliance requirements
that are not applicable to operating facilities. 

Within the coal mining remediation
market, demand for our services will be limited to a specific customer base and highly correlated to the coal mining industry. The coal
mining industry s demand for our services and products is affected by a number of factors including the volatile nature of the coal
mining industry s business, increased use of alternative types of energy and technological developments in the coal mining extraction
process. A significant reduction in the target market s demand for coal mining would reduce the demand for our services and products,
which would have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

We require a variety of permits to operate our
business. If we are not successful in obtaining and/or maintaining those permits it will adversely impact our operations. 

Our land reclamation and water
treatment business requires permits to operate. Our inability to obtain permits in a timely manner could result in substantial delays
to our business. The issuance of permits is dependent on the applicable government agencies and is beyond our control and that of our
customers. There can be no assurance that we and/or our customers will receive the permits necessary to operate, which could substantially
and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. 

Based on the nature of our business, we currently
depend and are likely to continue to depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. 

We currently have one customer
in West Virginia that accounts for all of our land reclamation and water treatment business. The failure to obtain additional customers
or the loss of all or a portion of the revenues attributable to any current or future customer as a result of competition, creditworthiness,
inability to negotiate extensions or replacement of contracts or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

If our customers do not enter
into, extend or honor their contracts with us, our profitability could be adversely affected. Our ability to receive payment for production
depends on the continued solvency and creditworthiness of our customers and prospective customers. If any of our customers creditworthiness
suffers, we may bear an increased risk with respect to payment defaults. If customers refuse to make payments for which they have a contractual
obligation, our revenues could be adversely affected. 

If we are unable to identify and acquire businesses
or assets in furtherance of our impact investing strategy, we may be unable to generate significant revenue. 

We intend to acquire additional
businesses and assets that will generate revenue related to our impact investing strategy and there can no assurance that we will be able
to do so, or to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, or in a manner that will provide us with the revenue we expect. 

Our consideration of sustainability
and environmental criteria as the pre-eminent part of our business and investment strategy will limit the types and number of business
opportunities available to the Company and may result in the Company engaging in industry sectors that underperform the market as a whole,
or forgoing opportunities to invest available capital in businesses that might otherwise be advantageous to acquire or develop. If we
are not successful in acquiring or developing desirable businesses or assets which fit within our business strategy or if those businesses
do not generate sufficient revenue, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 

Our impact investing strategy is new, untested
and may not be successful. 

Our impact investing strategy
is qualitative and subjective by nature, and there is no guarantee that the factors we utilize in making capital and other resource allocation
decisions or any judgment exercised by our management or board will reflect the opinions of any particular shareholder, and the investment
criteria utilized by the Company may differ from the investment criteria that any particular shareholder considers relevant in evaluating
a company s sustainability or impact investing practices. In making allocation and investment decisions, Company management will
be dependent upon information and data obtained through voluntary or third-party reporting, if available, that may be incomplete, inaccurate
or present conflicting information and data with respect to a particular opportunity, which in each case could cause the Company to incorrectly
assess a potential target s business practices with respect to its sustainability and impact investing practices. Socially and environmentally-responsible
norms differ by region. In implementing its impact investing strategy, management will seek to exclude businesses deemed to be fundamentally
misaligned with the Company s sustainability principles. In addition, as a result of the Company s engagement activities,
the Company may make an investment in activities or companies that do not currently engage in sustainability or impact investing practices
that meet criteria established by the Company in an effort to improve such target s impact investing practices. Successful application
of the Company s impact investing strategy and management s engagement efforts will depend on management s skill in
properly identifying and analyzing material sustainability issues, and there can be no assurance that the strategy or techniques employed
will be successful. 

34 

We have limited experience operating an impact
investing strategy and may be subject to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results. 

We have limited experience operating
a business with an impact investing strategy. If we are unable to manage our impact investing operations successfully, our financial results
could be adversely affected. 

We may be unable to obtain the financing we
need to pursue our impact investing strategy and any future financing we receive may be less favorable to us than our current financing
arrangements, either of which may adversely affect our ability to expand our operations. 

Sustainability-focused businesses
we may seek to acquire or develop will require substantial capital investment. Our access to capital on acceptable or favorable terms
to us is necessary for the success of our impact investing strategy, particularly in enhancing our portfolio through M A activities.
Our attempts to obtain the necessary future financing may not be successful or result in financing available on favorable terms. Our ability
to arrange for financing on a substantially non-recourse or limited recourse basis, and the costs of such financing, are dependent on
numerous factors, including general economic conditions, conditions in the global capital and credit markets, investor confidence, the
success of our business, the credit quality of the businesses being financed, and the continued existence of tax laws which are conducive
to raising capital for these types of activities. If we are not able to obtain financing on a substantially non-recourse or limited recourse
basis, we may have to finance our M A activities using recourse capital such as direct equity investments or the incurrence of additional
debt by us. Also, in the absence of favorable financing options, we may decide not to develop or acquire facilities or businesses from
third parties. Any of these alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects. 

We may also need additional financing
to implement our impact investing strategic plan. For example, our cash flow from operations and existing liquidity facilities may not
be adequate to finance any acquisitions we may seek to pursue or new technologies we may seek to develop or acquire. Financing for acquisitions
or technology development activities may not be available on terms we find acceptable. 

Unfavorable legislative changes could affect
our financial results. 

The environmental assets we are
considering purchasing are often subject to environmental regulations, and we expect such regulatory conditions to influence the assumptions
we will make regarding the future revenues and expenses associated with such proposed acquisitions. If those regulatory conditions change,
our revenues may decrease and our expenses may increase, adversely affecting our financial results. 

The reduction or elimination of government incentives
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flows. 

Our impact investing strategy
benefits from those public policies and government incentives that support renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of sustainability-based
projects in regions where we operate. Such policies and incentives include tax credits, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, renewable
portfolio standards, carbon trading mechanisms, rebates, and may include similar or other incentives to end users, distributors, or other
participants in the energy or mining industry. Some of these measures have been implemented at the federal level, while others have been
implemented by various states within the United States. The availability and continuation of these public policies and government incentives
are likely to have a significant effect on the economics and viability of our environmental businesses. Changes to such public policies
or any reduction in or elimination or expiration of such government incentives supporting or deregulating the exploration, production
and use of fossil fuels may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy industry, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, future results, and cash flows. 

We may decide not to implement, or may not be
successful in implementing, one or more elements of our multi-year strategic plan, and the plan as implemented may not achieve its goal
of enhancing shareholder value through the long-term growth of our Company. 

We are implementing a multi-year
strategic plan to develop an impact investing business engaged in a number of complimentary impact investing businesses in the United
States which will permit us to explore synergistic growth opportunities utilizing our core competencies. 

There are uncertainties and risks
associated with our strategic plan, including with respect to implementation and outcome. We may decide to change, or to not implement,
one or more elements of the plan over time or we may not be successful in implementing one or more elements of the plan, in each case
for a number of reasons. For example, we may face significant challenges and risks expanding into an impact investing business including: 

our ability to compete with the large number of other companies pursuing similar business opportunities, many of which already have established businesses in the geographic regions we are targeting and/or have greater financial, strategic, technological or other resources than we have; 

our ability to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, which we may need, for example, to develop new projects, to obtain desired technology, personnel, or intellectual property, to acquire one or more existing businesses as a platform for our expansion, or to fund internal research and development; 

our ability to provide services or products that keep pace with rapidly changing technology, customer preferences, equipment costs, increasing raw materials and transportation costs, market conditions and other factors that currently are unknown to us that will impact these markets; 

our ability to manage the risks and uncertainties associated with our operating the facilities and projects in this line of business, including the variability of revenues and profitability of such projects; 

our ability to devote the management and other resources required to successfully implement this plan; and 

our ability to recruit appropriate employees and address labor market challenges in those geographic regions in which we intend to operate. 

Apart from the risks associated
with implementing the plan, the plan itself will expose us to other risks and uncertainties once implemented. Expanding our customer base
may expose us to customers with different credit profiles than our current customers. Expanding our geographic base will subject us to
risks associated with doing business in new regions where we will have to learn the local business and political environment. In addition,
expanding into new technologies will expose us to new risks and uncertainties that are unknown to us now in addition to the risks and
uncertainties that may be similar to those we now face. The success of the plan, once implemented, will depend, among other things, on
our ability to manage these risks effectively. There is no assurance that the plan will enhance shareholder value through long-term growth
of the Company to the extent currently anticipated by our management or at all. 

We may engage in transactions with businesses
or entities affiliated with our executive officers, directors or major shareholders which may raise potential conflicts of interest. 

In carrying our impact investing
strategy, we may decide to enter into a transaction or acquire a business affiliated with our executive officers, directors or one or
more of our major shareholders. We would pursue a transaction with an affiliated entity if we determined that such affiliated entity met
our criteria and guidelines for a business combination or other transaction, and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent
and disinterested directors. We may not obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity regarding
the fairness to the Company from a financial point of view of such a business combination or transaction. In the event of a transaction
with an affiliated entity, potential conflicts of interest may exist and, as a result, the terms of the transaction may not be as advantageous
to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. 

35 

We may not be able to successfully conclude
the transactions or integrate the companies which we may acquire in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, future results and cash flow. 

We intend to carry out our impact
investing strategy primarily through acquisitions. Integrating acquisitions is often costly, and we may be unable to successfully integrate
our acquired businesses with our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences.
Integrating our acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, including: 

failure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect; 

inability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies; 

risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities; and 

the difficulty of establishing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including accounting controls and procedures. 

If any of our acquired companies
suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems, this could adversely affect our reputation and could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. 

Concentration of customers, specific projects
and regions may expose us to heightened financial exposure. 

The success of our impact investing
strategy may be heavily dependent on one or a limited number of customers. The financial performance of those businesses depends on the
ability of each customer to perform its respective obligations, possibly under a long-term agreement between the parties. Our financial
results could be materially and adversely affected if any of our customers fail to fulfill its contractual obligations and we are unable
to find other customers in the marketplace to purchase at the same level of profitability. We cannot be assured that such performance
failures by our customers will not occur, or that if they do occur, such failures will not adversely affect the cash flows or profitability
of our businesses. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into replacement agreements on favorable terms or
at all. 

Although we have identified general criteria
and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into business combinations that
do not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines. 

Although we have identified general
criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses that fall within our impact investing strategy, it is possible that
we may acquire or enter into transactions with a target business which will not meet all of these criteria. If shareholder approval of
the transaction is required by applicable law or other requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other
reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of those business combinations if the target business does not
meet our general criteria and guidelines. 

We may make future acquisitions or form partnerships
and joint ventures that may involve numerous risks that could impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Our impact investing strategy
may include expanding our scope of products and services organically or through selective acquisitions, investments or creating partnerships
and joint ventures. We may selectively acquire other businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies that are complementary
to our business. We may be unable to find or consummate future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms, or we may be unable to integrate
existing or future acquisitions effectively and efficiently and may need to divest those acquisitions. We expect to continually evaluate
potential acquisition opportunities in the ordinary course of business. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including among others: 

our evaluation of the synergies and/or long-term benefits of an acquired business; 

integration difficulties, including challenges and costs associated with implementing systems, processes and controls to comply with the requirements of a publicly-traded company; 

diverting management s attention; 

litigation arising from acquisition activity; 

potential increased debt leverage; 

potential issuance of dilutive equity securities; 

entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; 

unanticipated costs and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities or operating challenges; 

potential goodwill or other intangible asset impairments; 

potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies; 

our ability to properly establish and maintain effective internal controls over an acquired company; and 

increasing demands on our operational and IT systems. 

The success of acquisitions of
businesses, new technologies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in
realizing our objectives as anticipated. Furthermore, any future credit facility entered into in connection with such acquisitions may
contain certain financial and operational covenants that limit, or that may have the effect of limiting, among other things, the payment
of dividends, acquisitions, capital expenditures, the sale of assets and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. 

36 

We could be exposed to significant liability
for violations of hazardous substances laws because of the use or presence of such substances at our facilities or properties. 

Our impact investing business
operations will be subject to numerous federal, regional, state and local statutory and regulatory standards relating to the generation,
handling, transportation, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. If any hazardous substances are found to have
been released into the environment at or by one of our facilities or on one of our properties in concentrations that exceed regulatory
limits, we could become liable for the investigation and removal of those substances, regardless of their source and time of release.
If we fail to comply with these laws, ordinances or regulations (or any change thereto), we could be subject to, among other things, civil
or criminal liability, the imposition of liens or fines, the cessation of operations, or substantial expenditures necessary to bring our
operations into compliance. Furthermore, under certain federal and states laws, we can be held liable for the cleanup of releases of hazardous
substances at any of our current or former facilities or at any other locations where we arranged for disposal of those substances, even
if we did not cause the release at that location or if the release complied with applicable law at the time it occurred. Liability under
these laws can be joint and several. The cost of any remediation activities in connection with a spill or other release of such substances
could be significant and could expose us to significant liability. 

Our operations could be adversely impacted by
climate change. 

Our environmental services operations
may be susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by extreme weather conditions such as droughts, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and
water or other natural resource shortages, occurrences of which may increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change.
Climate change may also produce general changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels.
To the extent weather conditions continue to be impacted by climate change, our environmental services operations and facilities may be
adversely impacted in a manner that we could not predict which may in turn adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, the
potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, could
disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs to prepare for or respond to these effects. 

If we are deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted,
which may make it difficult for us to carry out our impact investing strategy. 

If we are deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be subject to, among other things, restrictions on the nature of our investments
and the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to carry out our planned impact investing strategy. In addition,
we may be subject to additional requirements including: (i) registration as an investment company with the SEC; (ii) adoption of a specific
form of corporate structure; and (iii) reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations
that we are currently not subject to. Compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which
we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to carry out our impact investing strategy. 

In order not to be regulated as
an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily
in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting,
owning, holding or trading investment securities constituting more than 40 of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government
securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will include identifying and completing business combination and thereafter
to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale
or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor. We do not believe that
our principal activities will subject us to registration under the Investment Company Act. 

Risks Related to our Common Stock 

Our common stock is illiquid and the price of
our common stock may be negatively impacted by any negative operational results and factors unrelated to our operations. 

Our common stock is quoted on
the OTCQB trading and the OTCQB is frequently highly volatile, with low trading volume. We have experienced significant fluctuations in
the price and trading volume of our common stock, which may be caused by factors relating to our business and operational results and/or
factors unrelated to the Company, including general market conditions. An active market for our common stock may never develop, in which
case it could be difficult for stockholders to sell their common stock. The market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate
substantially. 

Trading of our stock is restricted by the SEC s
 penny stock regulations and certain FINRA rules, which may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our common
stock. 

Our securities are covered by
certain penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell low-priced securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, a broker-dealer must make
a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior
to sale, among other things. These rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers and holders to sell our common stock and may negatively
impact the level of trading activity for our common stock. To the extent our common stock remains subject to the penny stock regulations,
such regulations may discourage investor interest in and adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock. 

The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA) has adopted rules that require a broker-dealer, when recommending an investment to a customer, to have reasonable grounds
for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional
customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status,
investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that
speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers
to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit an investor s ability to buy and sell our common stock and
could have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. 

If we issue and sell additional shares of our
common stock in the future, our existing stockholders will be diluted and our stock price could fall. 

Our articles of incorporation
authorize the issuance of up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, of which, as of November 1, 2024, 104,727,189 shares were outstanding
and 18,855,879 shares were reserved for issuance under our stock incentive plan and other outstanding options or warrants. As a result,
we have a large number of shares of common stock that are authorized for issuance that are not outstanding or otherwise reserved, and
could be issued at the discretion of our Board of Directors. We expect to seek additional financing in the future in order to fund our
operations, and if we issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our existing stockholders will
be diluted. Our Board of Directors may also choose to issue shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for
our common stock to acquire assets or companies, for compensation to employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors, to fund
capital expenditures and to enter into strategic partnerships. Additionally, shares of common stock could be issued for anti-takeover
purposes or to delay or prevent changes in control or management of the Company. Our Board of Directors may determine to issue shares
of our common stock on terms that our stockholders do not believe enhance stockholder value, or that may ultimately have an adverse effect
on our business or the trading price of our common stock. Further, the issuance of any such shares may cause further dilution to the ownership
interest of our current stockholders, reduce the book value per share of our common stock and may contribute to a reduction in the market
price for our common stock. 

Our principal stockholders and management own
a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval. 

Certain of our executive officers,
directors and stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock. As of November 1, 2024, our executive officers,
directors, holders of 5 or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 53.8 of our outstanding
shares of common stock. Accordingly, our directors, executive officers and certain stockholders have significant influence over our affairs
due to their substantial stock ownership coupled with their positions on our management team. For example, these stockholders may be able
to control or influence elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets,
or other major corporate transaction. This concentration of ownership may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers
for our common stock that some of our stockholders may believe is in their best interest. 

We are subject to the reporting requirements
of federal securities laws, compliance with which involves significant time, expense and expertise. 

We are a public reporting company
and are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, including the obligations
imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The ongoing costs associated with preparing and filing annual, quarterly and current reports,
proxy statements and other information with the SEC in the ordinary course, as well as preparing and filing audited financial statements,
are significant and may cause unexpected increases in operational expenses. Our present management team is relatively small and may be
unable to manage the ongoing costs and compliance effectively. It may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to hire additional
financial reporting, accounting and other finance staff in order to build and retain a management team with adequate expertise and experience
in operating a public company. 

We have never paid dividends on our capital
stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

The continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial
funding. We have paid no cash dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our available cash to fund
the development and growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of
Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable
law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the
foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, which may never occur.
