Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may, can, will, would, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, forecasts, potential, or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about: 

our expectations regarding our revenue, expenses and other operating results; 

the anticipated growth of our business, including our ability to effectively manage or sustain our growth and to achieve or sustain profitability; 

the effects of public health crises or other macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tension, which may lead to periods of global economic uncertainty; 

future investments in our business, our anticipated capital expenditures and our estimates regarding our capital requirements; 

our ability to attract new buyers and suppliers and successfully engage new and existing buyers and suppliers; 

the costs and success of our sales and marketing efforts, and our ability to promote our brand; 

our reliance on key personnel and our ability to identify, recruit and retain skilled personnel; 

our ability to effectively manage our growth, including any international expansion; 

our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property or other proprietary rights and any costs associated therewith; 

our ability to effectively manage our costs and expenses, which may be impacted by inflationary pressures; 

our ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants; and 

the growth rates of the markets in which we compete. 

You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors Part II, Item 1A, and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Form 10-Q. And while we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. 
 The forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments.

, or in the case of leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the useful life of the asset. Property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Property and equipment includes capitalized internal-use software development costs. Eligible internal-use software development costs are capitalized subsequent to the completion of the preliminary project stage. Such costs include internal and external direct development costs totali ng m illion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the year ended December 31, 2023 . After all substantial testing and deployment is completed and the software is ready for its intended use, capitalization is discontinued and the internal-use software costs are placed in service and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately million of revenue related to its contract liabilities as of December 31, 2023. Sales Contract Acquisition Costs The Company s incremental costs to obtain a contract may include a sales commission which is generally determined on a per order basis. For marketplace contracts, the Company recognizes costs over a period of one year or less. For supplier service contracts in excess of one year, the Company amortizes such costs on a straight-line basis over the average customer life of for new customers and over the renewal period for existing customers which is generally . Sales commissions are included in the Company's sales and marketing expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized approximately million and million, respectively, of amortization related to deferred sales commissions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company recognized approximately million and million, respectively, of amortization related to deferred sales commissions.

. The fair value of the restricted stock units and PRSUs is determined using the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. Forfeitures are recorded in the period in which they occur. The Black-Scholes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based awards. These variables include: expected annual dividend yield; 

 expected volatility over the expected term; 

 expected term; 

 risk free interest rate; 

 per share value of the underlying common stock; and 

 exercise price. 

 For all stock options granted, the Company calculated the expected term using the simplified method for plain vanilla stock option awards. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury issuances similar in duration to the expected term of the stock-based award. The Company estimates its expected share price volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and/or its own volatility and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded share price. The Company utilized a dividend yield of zero, as it had no history or plan of declaring dividends on its common stock. The fair value for PRSUs is recognized on a ratable basis over the requisite service period of three years when it is probable the performance conditions of the awards will be met. The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjusts the total compensation expense of the award based on this probability assessment.

During the second quarter of 2023, following an assessment of its lease portfolio, the Company abandoned certain leases and/or portions of its leases in New York, NY, Horsham, PA, Culver City, CA, Doraville, GA and Gaithersburg, MD. As a result of abandoning these leases, the Company ceased its use of these locations and accelerated the amortization of the ROU assets to reduce the ROU assets carrying values to zero. The Company recognized a one-time charge of million of additional operating lease expense during the second quarter of 2023 in general and administrative on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

 million (undiscounted) in shares of the Company s Class A common stock in two installments on the first and second anniversary of the acquisition. The contingent consideration arrangement is tied to the achievement of revenue thresholds. The initial fair value of the contingent consideration of million was estimated by applying an income valuation approach. The measurement is based on inputs that are not observable in the market (Level 3 inputs). Key assumptions made include (a) discount rate and (b) probability weighted assumptions about achieving revenue thresholds. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total contingent consideration had a fair value of million and million, respectively. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded an approximate million increase to the contingent consideration liability with a corresponding expense recognized in general and administrative expense on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. In February 2024, the Company issued shares of Class A common stock with a value of million to the former owners of Tridi with respect to the first installment.

The 2027 Notes consisted of a million initial placement and an over-allotment option that provided the initial purchasers of the 2027 Notes with the option to purchase an additional million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes, which was fully exercised. The 2027 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated . The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes were million, net of debt issuance costs. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method. The 2027 Notes are unsecured obligations which bear regular interest at per annum and for which the principal balance will not accrete. Interest payments are due on February 1 and August 1 of each year the Notes remain outstanding. The 2027 Notes will mature on unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The 2027 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of shares of Class A common stock per principal amount of 2027 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of our Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments for certain events as described in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes, at our option, on or after February 5, 2025 if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest or additional interest, if any. Holders of the 2027 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2027 Notes at their option prior to November 1, 2026, in multiples of principal amounts, only under the following circumstances: if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price of the 2027 Notes on each such trading day; 

 during the business day period after any consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per principal amount of the 2027 Notes for each day of that ten consecutive trading day period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate of the 2027 Notes; 

 on a notice of redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, in which case we may be required to increase the conversion rate for the 2027 Notes so surrendered for conversion in connection with such redemption notice; or 

 on the occurrence of specified corporate events. 

 On or after November 1, 2026, the 2027 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Holders of the 2027 Notes who convert the 2027 Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes, or in connection with a redemption are entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the 2027 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2027 Notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of 2027 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any. We accounted for the issuance of the 2027 Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as no other embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives.

 Item 2 . Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future and our current quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year or any other period. 
 Overview 
 Xometry Inc. Xometry , Company , our or we was incorporated in the State of Delaware in May 2013. Xometry is a global artificial intelligence AI powered online marketplace connecting buyers with suppliers of manufacturing services, driving the digital transformation of one of the largest industries in the world. We use our proprietary AI, machine learning and cloud-based services, including our Thomasnet platform, to help buyers efficiently source custom-manufactured parts and assemblies, and empower suppliers of manufacturing services to grow their businesses. Xometry s corporate headquarters is located in North Bethesda, Maryland. 
 Our AI-enabled technology platform is powered by proprietary machine learning algorithms and datasets, resulting in a sophisticated two-sided marketplace that is rapidly digitizing the manufacturing industry. As a result, buyers can procure the products they want on demand, and suppliers can source new manufacturing opportunities that match their specific capabilities and capacity, ultimately resulting in locally resilient supply chains so goods can get to market faster. Every interaction on our marketplace provides rich data insights that allow us to continuously improve our AI models and create new products and services, fueling powerful network effects as we scale. 
 We use proprietary technology to enable product designers, engineers, buyers, and supply chain professionals to instantly access the capacity of a global network of manufacturing facilities. The Company s platform makes it possible for buyers to quickly receive pricing, expected lead times, manufacturability feedback and place orders on the Company s platform. The network allows the Company to provide high volumes of unique parts, including custom components and assemblies for its buyers. 
 Our mission is to accelerate innovation by providing real time, equitable access to global manufacturing capacity and demand. Our vision is to drive efficiency, sustainability and innovation for industries worldwide by lowering the barriers to entry to the manufacturing ecosystem. 
 Our business benefits from a virtuous network effect, because adding buyers to our platform generates greater demand on our marketplace which in turn attracts more suppliers to the platform, allowing us to rapidly scale and increase the number of manufacturing processes offered on our platform. In order to continue to meet the needs of buyers and remain highly competitive, we expect to continue to add suppliers to our platform that have new and innovative manufacturing processes. Thus, our platform is unbounded by the in-house manufacturing capacity and processes of our current suppliers. 
 We define buyers as individuals who have placed an order to purchase custom-manufactured, on-demand parts or assemblies on our marketplace. Our buyers include engineers, product designers, procurement and supply chain personnel, inventors, entrepreneurs and business owners from businesses of a variety of sizes, ranging from self-funded start-ups to Fortune 100 companies. We define accounts as an individual entity, such as a sole proprietor with a single buyer or corporate entities with multiple buyers, having purchased at least one part on our marketplace. We define suppliers as individuals or businesses who have been approved by us to either manufacture a product on our platform for a buyer or have utilized our supplier services, including our financial services or the purchase of tools and materials our tools and materials business, which we previously referred to as our supplies business ). 
 The majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of part(s) and assemblies to our customers on our marketplace, which we refer to as marketplace revenue. The suppliers on our platform offer a diversified and expanding mix of manufacturing processes. These manufacturing processes include computer numerical control CNC manufacturing, sheet metal forming, sheet cutting, 3D printing (including fused deposition modeling, direct metal laser sintering, PolyJet, stereolithography, selective laser sintering, binder jetting, carbon digital light synthesis, multi jet fusion and lubricant sublayer photo-curing), die casting, stamping, injection molding, urethane casting, tube cutting, tube bending, as well as finishing services, rapid prototyping and high-volume production. Xometry's extensible technology platform allows the Company to add new technologies and processes to gain more wallet share with our buyers. We enable buyers to source these processes to meet complex and specific design and order needs across several industries, including Aerospace, Healthcare, Robotics, Industrial, Defense, Energy, Automotive, Government, Education and Consumer Goods. 
 We empower suppliers to grow their manufacturing businesses and improve machine uptime by providing access to an extensive, diverse base of buyers. We also offer suppliers supporting products and services to meet their unique needs. Through Thomasnet, a leading industrial sourcing platform in North America, we offer suppliers an array of digital advertising and marketing

 services and data solutions. In addition, our suite of supplier services includes financial service products to stabilize and enhance cash flow and a cloud-based manufacturing execution system Workcenter to help suppliers optimize their productivity. 
 In 2021, we acquired Thomas Publishing Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, Thomas and Fusiform, Inc. (d/b/a FactoryFour), expanding our basket of supplier services to include advertising and marketing services and Workcenter to help suppliers optimize their productivity. Our revenue from Thomas is primarily advertising revenue. 
 On January 2, 2023, we acquired Tridi Teknoloj A.S. Tridi located in Istanbul, T rkiye pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement. The acquisition of Tridi extends our marketplace capabilities in Europe and provides us access to the Turkish market. 
 Unfavorable conditions in the economy both in the United States and abroad may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic events, fluctuations in inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war, conflict in the Middle East and other geopolitical tensions, have led to economic uncertainty globally. Historically, during periods of economic uncertainty and downturns, businesses may slow spending on information technology and manufacturing, which may impact our business and our customers businesses. 
 The effect of macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. If, however, economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. For further discussion of the potential impacts of macroeconomic events on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Key Marketplace Operational and Business Metrics 
 In addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we use the following key operational and business metrics to help us evaluate our marketplace business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and develop forecasts, and make strategic decisions: 
 Active Buyers 
 We define Active Buyers as the number of buyers who have made at least one purchase on our marketplace during the last twelve months. An increase or decrease in the number of Active Buyers is a key indicator of our ability to attract, retain and engage buyers on our platform. 
 Active Buyers has consistently grown over time. The number of Active Buyers on our platform reached 64,851 as of September 30, 2024, up 24 from 52,382 as of September 30, 2023. The key drivers of Active Buyer growth are continued account and buyer engagement and the success of our strategy to attract new buyers. 

Percentage of Revenue from Existing Accounts 
 We define an existing account as an account where at least one buyer has made a purchase on our marketplace. We believe the efficiency and transparency of our business model leads to increasing account stickiness and spend over time. Buyers can utilize our marketplace for both one-off and recurring manufacturing opportunities. For example, a buyer may choose to utilize our marketplace s CNC manufacturing processes to manufacture a discrete component for a prototype, and then may choose to later use our marketplace to mass produce that same component. A buyer may also recommend our marketplace to other engineers within their organizations who are designing other products and who may use an entirely different set of manufacturing processes, deepening our reach and stickiness with an account. 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, 97 of our revenue was generated from existing accounts. We believe the repeat purchase activity from existing accounts reflects the underlying strength of our business and provides us with substantial revenue visibility and predictability. 

Accounts with Last Twelve-Month Spend of At Least 50,000 
 Accounts with Last Twelve-Month, or LTM, Spend of At Least 50,000 means an account that has spent at least 50,000 on our marketplace in the most recent twelve-month period. We view the acquisition of an account as a foundation for the addition of long-term buyers to our marketplace. Once an account joins our platform, we aim to expand the relationship and increase engagement and spending activities from that account over time. The number of accounts with LTM Spend of at least 50,000 on our platform reached 1,506 as of September 30, 2024, up 23 from 1,223 as of September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

Active Paying Suppliers 
 We define Active Paying Suppliers as individuals or businesses who have purchased one or more of our supplier services, including digital marketing services, data services, financial services or tools and materials, on our platforms during the last twelve months. An increase or decrease in the number of Active Paying Suppliers is a key indicator of our ability to engage suppliers on our platform. 
 Active Paying Suppliers has changed over time. The number of Active Paying Suppliers on our platform was 6,762 as of September 30, 2024, down 9 from 7,415 as of September 30, 2023. The decline during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to our exit from the tools and materials business and the wind down of Thomas non-core services. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for interest expense, interest and dividend income, other expenses, provision for income taxes, and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net loss from time to time, principally comprised of depreciation and amortization, amortization of lease intangible, stock-based compensation, payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, lease abandonment, charitable contributions of common stock, income from an unconsolidated joint venture, impairment of assets, restructuring charges, costs to exit the tools and materials business and acquisition and other adjustments not reflective of our ongoing business, such as adjustments related to purchase accounting, the revaluation of contingent consideration, transaction costs and executive severance. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period.

(1) In the second quarter of 2024, we changed the definition of Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) to exclude payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. For prior periods, this amount was considered de minimis and, accordingly, we have not adjusted the Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) amounts for such periods. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Non-GAAP net income was 1.1 million, as compared to Non-GAAP net loss of (2.6) million for the same quarter in 2023. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Non-GAAP net income (loss) was 0.8 of revenue, as compared to (2.2) of revenue for the same quarter in 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Non-GAAP net loss was (5.2) million, as compared to Non-GAAP net loss of (19.0) million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Non-GAAP net loss was (1.3) of revenue, as compared to (5.7) of revenue for the same period in 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) are non-GAAP financial measures that we use, in addition to our GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our business. We have included Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) in this filing because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies and therefore may not serve as an accurate basis of comparison among companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income (loss) should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Our marketplace revenue is primarily comprised of sales of parts and assemblies to customers through our platform. Buyers purchase specialized CNC manufacturing, sheet metal manufacturing, 3D printing, injection molding, urethane casting, tube cutting, tube bending and finishing services. Customer purchases range from rapid prototyping of single parts to high-volume production on our marketplace. These products are primarily manufactured by our network of suppliers. 
 Supplier services revenue includes the sale of marketing and advertising services, and to a lesser extent financial service products, SaaS-based solutions and the sale of tools and materials, which was discontinued during the second quarter of 2023.

 Marketplace cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost to us of the products that are manufactured or produced by us or our suppliers for delivery to buyers on our platform, internal and external production costs, shipping costs and certain internal depreciation. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars to the extent our revenue increases and transaction volume increases. As we grow and add suppliers to our platform, we are able to improve our pricing efficiency, we expect cost of revenue to decline as a percentage of revenue over time. 
 Cost of revenue for supplier services primarily consists of internal and external production costs and website hosting. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, is primarily affected by the growth of our revenue. Our gross profit margin is primarily affected by liquidity of our suppliers network and the efficiency of our pricing and will be benefited by increasing the use of existing supplier services and the variety of supplier services offerings over time. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, operations and support, product development, general and administrative functions and impairment of assets. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include the costs of our digital marketing strategies, branding costs and other advertising costs, certain depreciation and amortization expense, contract acquisition costs and compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, to our sales and marketing employees. We intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing capabilities in the future to continue to increase our brand awareness, add new accounts and further penetrate existing accounts. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we grow our business, though in the near-term sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate from period-to-period based on the timing of our investments in our sales and marketing functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale over future periods. 
 Operations and Support 
 Operations and support expenses are the costs we incur in support of the buyers and suppliers on our platform which are provided by phone, email and chat for purposes of resolving buyer and suppliers related matters. These costs primarily consist of compensation expenses of the support staff, including stock-based compensation, certain depreciation and amortization expense and software costs used in delivering buyer and suppliers services. We expect operations and support expense to increase in absolute dollars in the future, though in the near-term operations and support expenses may fluctuate from period-to-period based on total revenue levels and the timing of our investments in our operations and support functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale over future periods. 
 Product Development 
 Product development costs that are not eligible for capitalization are expensed as incurred. This account also includes compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses to our employees performing routine improvements and maintenance on our platforms not related to a specific capitalizable project, software costs and certain depreciation and amortization expense. We expect product development expense to increase in absolute dollars in the future, though in the near-term product development expenses may fluctuate from period-to-period based on total revenue levels and the timing of our investments in our product development functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale over future periods.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 We have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and borrowings under our convertible notes. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 234.0 million. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We believe we will meet our longer-term expected future cash requirements primarily from a combination of cash flow from operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. We may also engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, receivable and payable cycles, the timing and extent of investments in product development, sales and marketing, operations and support and general and administrative expenses. 
 Our capital expenditures consist primarily of internal-use software costs, manufacturing equipment, computers and peripheral equipment, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements and patents. 
 
 Convertible Notes due 2027 
 In February 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement with certain counterparties for the sale of an aggregate of 287.5 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2027 (the 2027 Notes in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The 2027 Notes consisted of a 250 million initial placement and an over-allotment option that provided the initial purchasers of the 2027 Notes with the option to purchase an additional 37.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes, which was fully exercised. The 2027 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated February 4, 2022. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes were 278.2 million, net of debt issuance costs. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method. 
 The 2027 Notes are unsecured obligations which bear regular interest at 1 per annum and for which the principal balance will not accrete. Interest payments are due on February 1 and August 1 of each year the Notes remain outstanding. The 2027 Notes will mature on February 1, 2027 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. 
 The 2027 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 17.8213 shares of Class A common stock per 1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 56.11 per share of our Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments for certain events as described in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes. 
 We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes, at our option, on or after February 5, 2025 if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock has been at least 130 of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest or additional interest, if any. 
 Holders of the 2027 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2027 Notes at their option prior to November 1, 2026, in multiples of 1,000 principal amounts, only under the following circumstances: 
 if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the applicable conversion price of the 2027 Notes on each such trading day; 

during the five-business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes for each day of that ten consecutive trading day period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate of the 2027 Notes; 

on a notice of redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, in which case we may be required to increase the conversion rate for the 2027 Notes so surrendered for conversion in connection with such redemption notice; or 

on the occurrence of specified corporate events. 

On or after November 1, 2026, the 2027 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. 
 Holders of the 2027 Notes who convert the 2027 Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes, or in connection with a redemption are entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the 2027 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2027 Notes at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of 2027 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any.

Table of Contents 

 We accounted for the issuance of the 2027 Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as no other embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 2027 Notes have a carrying value of 283.2 million with an effective annual interest rate of 1.6 . 
 We may, from time to time, repurchase our convertible senior notes using cash on hand, either on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation of 21.1 million, depreciation and amortization of 9.6 million, and a 3.3 million of reduction to our right of use lease assets.

The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation of 16.2 million, 13.3 million of reduction to our right of use lease assets, and depreciation and amortization of 7.9 million. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities is primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable of 14.9 million and lease liabilities of 3.8 million, offset by changes in contract liabilities of 1.2 million, accrued expenses of 1.0 million, prepaid expenses of 2.3 million and other assets of 1.4 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used by investing activities was 14.7 million, primarily due to the purchase of marketable securities 16.3 million and purchase of property and equipment (which includes the internal-use software development costs) of 13.6 million offset by the sale of marketable securities of 15.0 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was 6.2 million, primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 30.0 million offset by the purchase of property and equipment (which includes internal-use software development costs) of 12.1 million, 8.6 million for the purchase of marketable securities, and 3.3 million for the acquisition of Tridi.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. For additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,

Table of Contents 

 2023 as well as Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and accounting estimates as compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a description of our recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted, see Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure to potential changes in interest rates. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our U.S. revenue and costs are principally denominated in U.S. dollars and are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. Our International operating segment generates revenue outside of the United States that is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our results of operations are impacted by changes in exchange rates. Outside the U.S., our International operations generate approximately 16 of our revenues, of which a majority is generated in Euros. If the average exchange rate of Euros changed unfavorably by 10 , our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have decreased by 1.3 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenues were not materially impacted as the average exchange rate remained consistent between the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures such as those caused by geopolitical tensions, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are not a party to any legal proceedings, that individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 For the period ended September 30, 2024, there were no material legal proceedings brought against us nor were there any material developments to any ongoing legal proceedings which constituted reportable events. 
 Item 1A . Risk Factors. 
 
 Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 
 There have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in Item 1A. contained in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 2 . Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
