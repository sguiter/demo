Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with Taboola s accompanying unaudited consolidated
 interim financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (the Quarterly Report and audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing in our Annual Report o n
 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
 (the SEC on February 28 , 2024 . Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis is set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K , including information with respect to Taboola s plans and strategy for Taboola s business, and includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those
 factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K and
 elsewhere herein, Taboola s actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Throughout this
 section, unless otherwise noted or the context requires otherwise, we, us, our and the Company refer to Taboola and its consolidated subsidiaries, and in references to monetary amounts, dollars and refer to U.S. Dollars, and NIS 
 refers to New Israeli Shekels. 

Overview

Taboola is a technology company that powers recommendations across the Open Web with an artificial intelligence, or AI-based, algorithmic engine that we have developed since the Company began operations in 2007.
 Taboola has also expanded more directly into e-Commerce, allowing its partners with digital properties the ability to use its platforms to display advertising suited to the audiences of those partners web sites or other digital services.

We think of ourselves as a search engine, but in reverse instead of expecting people to search for information, we recommend information to people or enable our partners to use our technology. You ve seen us
 before: we partner with websites, devices, and mobile apps, which we collectively refer to as digital properties, to recommend editorial content and advertisements on the Open Web, outside of the closed ecosystems of the walled gardens such as
 Facebook, Google, and Amazon.

Digital properties use our technology platforms to achieve their business goals, such as driving new audiences to their sites and apps, or increasing engagement on site and we don t charge them for these
 services. We also provide a meaningful monetization opportunity to digital properties by surfacing paid recommendations by Advertisers. Unlike walled gardens, we are a business-to-business, or B2B, company with no competing consumer interests. We
 only interact with consumers through our partners digital properties, hence we do not compete with our partners for user attention. Our motivations are aligned. When our partners win, we win, and we grow together.

We empower Advertisers to leverage our proprietary AI-powered recommendation platform to reach targeted audiences utilizing effective, native ad formats across digital properties. We generate revenues primarily
 when people (consumers) click on, purchase from or, in some cases, view the ads that appear within our partners digital experiences via our recommendation platform. Advertisers pay us for those clicks, purchases or impressions, and we share the
 resulting revenue with the digital properties who display those ads and generate those clicks and downstream consumer actions.

Our powerful recommendation platform was built to address a technology challenge of significant complexity: predicting which recommendations users would be interested in, without explicit intent data or social
 media profiles. Search advertising platforms have access, at a minimum, to users search queries which indicate intent, while social media advertising platforms have access to rich personal profiles created by users. In contrast, we base our
 recommendations on an extensive dataset of context and user behavior derived from the intersection of thousands of digital properties and millions of recommended items, including ads and editorial content.

Key Factors and Trends Affecting our Performance

We believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and those referred to
 in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 

Business and Macroeconomic Conditions

Global economic and geopolitical conditions have been increasingly volatile. Factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions and the wars in Israel and Ukraine negatively impacted
 advertising demand and our yields in 2022 in particular. Further, while the impacts of inflation have relatively stabilized over recent quarters, the higher equipment and labor costs needed to operate our business negatively impacted our business
 in 2022 and 2023 and caused us to enter 2024 with a lower revenue and Adjusted EBITDA run rate. We do not currently expect additional impact from these factors during 2024, though we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions closely.

Maintaining and Growing Our Digital Property Partners

We engage with a diverse network of digital property partners, substantially all of which have contracts with us containing either an evergreen term or an exclusive partnership with us for multi-year terms at
 inception. These agreements typically require that our code be integrated on the digital property web page because of the nature of providing both editorial and paid recommendations. This means that in the vast majority of our business, we do not
 bid for ad placements, as traditionally happens in the advertising technology space, but rather see all users that visit the pages on which we appear. Due to our multi-year exclusive contracts and high retention rates, our supply is relatively
 consistent and predictable. We had approximately 12,000, 15,000 and 16,000 digital property partners in the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2023, we saw a decrease in the number of long-tail digital property partners on
 our network, partially due to our own efforts to clean up our network and reduce low performing networks. Despite the decrease in the number of digital property partners on the network, our overall volume of page views went up over 10 from Q4
 2021 to Q4 2023, demonstrating that the decrease in the number of digital property partners in our network was driven by smaller digital property partners and more than offset by the addition of larger digital property partners.

Historically, we have had a strong record of growing the revenue generated from our digital property partners. We grow our digital property partner relationships in four ways. First, we grow the revenue from these
 partnerships by increasing our yield over time. We do this by improving our algorithms, expanding our Advertiser base and increasing the amount of data that helps target our ads. Second, we continuously innovate with new product offerings and
 features that increase revenue. Third, we innovate by launching new advertising formats. Fourth, we work closely with our digital property partners to find new placements and page types where we can help them drive more revenue.

For the majority of our digital properties partners, we have two primary models for sharing revenue with digital property partners. The most common model is a straight revenue share model. In this model, we agree
 to pay our partner a percentage of the revenue that we generate from advertisements placed on their digital properties. The second model includes guarantees. Under this model, we pay our partners the greater of a fixed percentage of the revenue
 we generate and a guaranteed amount per thousand page views. In the past, we have and may continue to be required to make significant payments under these guarantees.

Growing Our Advertiser Client Base

We have a large and growing network of Advertisers, across multiple verticals. We had approximately 17,000, 18,000 and 15,000 Advertiser clients working with us directly, or through advertising agencies, worldwide
 during the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decline from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by a channel partner that had a large number of small advertisers that they reduced in 2023. A large portion of our revenue comes
 from Advertisers with their own specific performance goals, such as obtaining subscribers for email newsletters or acquiring leads for product offerings. These performance Advertisers use our service when they obtain a sufficient return on ad
 spend to justify their ad spend. We grow the revenue from performance Advertisers in three ways. First, we improve the performance of our network by developing new product features, improving our algorithms and optimizing our supply. Second, we
 secure increased budgets from existing Advertisers by offering new ad formats and helping them achieve additional goals. Third, we grow our overall Advertiser base by bringing on new Advertisers that we have not worked with previously.

Improving Network Yield

One way that we grow our revenue is by increasing the yield on our network, which is a general term for the revenue that we make per advertising placement. Because we generally fill close to 100 of advertising
 impressions available, yield is generally not affected by changing fill rates, but rather is impacted in four ways. First, we increase our yield by improving the algorithms that select the right ad for a particular user in a particular context.
 These algorithms are based on Deep Learning technology and are a key competitive advantage. Second, we continuously innovate and develop new product offerings and features for Advertisers, which help increase their success rates on our network
 and improve yield. Third, as we grow our Advertiser base and mix of Advertisers, including adding Advertisers able to pay higher rates, our yields increase because of increasing competitive pressure in our auction. Finally, we increase our yield
 by optimizing the way we work with digital properties, including changing formats and placements. Increasing yield drives higher revenues on all digital property partners. Increasing yield also generally increases margins for ex-TAC Gross Profit,
 a non-GAAP measure, for those digital property partners to whom we are paying guarantees. In periods of slower growth or periods of economic stress advertising demand may decline causing a decrease in yields despite our efforts.

Product and Research and Development

We view research and development expenditures as investments that help grow our business over time. These investments, which are primarily in the form of employee salaries and related expenditures and hardware
 infrastructure, can be broken into two categories. This first category includes product innovations that extend the capabilities of our current product offerings and help us expand into completely new markets. This includes heavy investment in AI
 (specifically Deep Learning) in the form of server purchases and expenses for data scientists. This category of investment is important to maintain the growth of the business but can also generally be adjusted up or down based on management s
 perception of the potential value of different investment options. The second category of investments are those that are necessary to maintain our core business. These investments include items such as purchasing servers and other infrastructure
 necessary to handle increasing loads of recommendations that need to be served, as well as the personnel necessary to maintain the value delivered to our customers and digital property partners, such as investments in code maintenance for our
 existing products. This type of investment scales at a slower rate than the growth of our core business.

Managing Seasonality

The global advertising industry has historically been characterized by seasonal trends that also apply to the digital advertising ecosystem in which we operate. In particular, Advertisers have historically spent
 relatively more in the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with the year-end holiday shopping season, and relatively less in the first quarter. We expect these seasonality trends to continue, and our operating results will be affected
 by those trends with revenue and margins being seasonally strongest in the fourth quarter and seasonally weakest in the first quarter.

Privacy Trends and Government Regulation

We are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, digital advertising and the collection of user data. In addition, large Internet and technology companies such as
 Google and Apple are making their own decisions as to how to protect consumer privacy, which impacts the entire digital ecosystem. Because we power editorial recommendations, digital properties typically embed our code directly on their web
 pages. This makes us less susceptible to impact by many of these regulations and industry trends because we are able to drop first party cookies. In addition, because of this integration on our partners pages, we have rich contextual information
 to use to further refine the targeting of our recommendations.

Yahoo Partnership

In November 2022, we announced we had entered into a 30-year exclusive commercial agreement with Yahoo, under which we will power native advertising across all of Yahoo s digital properties, expanding our native
 advertising offering. In January 2023 we closed on the various related agreements, including the issuance of 39,525,691 Ordinary shares and 45,198,702 Non-voting Ordinary shares to Yahoo. For further information see Note 1b and Note 12 of Notes
 to the Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.

Key Financial and Operating Metrics

We regularly monitor a number of metrics in order to measure our current performance and project our future performance. These metrics aid us in developing and refining our growth strategies and making strategic
 decisions.

Table of Contents 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We are presenting the following non-GAAP financial measures because we use them, among other things, as key measures for our management and board of directors in managing our business and evaluating our
 performance. We believe they also provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors. The use of these measures may improve comparability of our results over time by adjusting for items that may vary from period to period or not be
 representative of our ongoing operations.

These non-GAAP measures are subject to significant limitations, including those identified below. In addition, other companies may use similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their
 usefulness as comparative measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. They should be considered as supplementary information in addition to GAAP operating, liquidity and financial
 performance measures.

ex-TAC Gross Profit

We calculate ex-TAC Gross Profit as gross profit adjusted to add back other cost of revenues and non-cash amortization of the
 Commercial agreement asset. We add back the non-cash amortization of the Commercial agreement asset because it is unique primarily due to the issuance of equity rather than cash, such that ex-TAC Gross Profit includes solely direct cash
 contribution components.

We believe that ex-TAC Gross Profit is useful because traffic acquisition cost, or TAC, is what we must pay digital properties to obtain the right to place advertising on their websites, and we believe focusing on
 ex-TAC Gross Profit better reflects the profitability of our business. We use ex-TAC Gross Profit as part of our business planning, for example in decisions regarding the timing and amount of investments in areas such as infrastructure.

Limitations on the use of ex-TAC Gross Profit include the following:

Traffic acquisition cost is a significant component of our cost of revenues but is not the only component; and

ex-TAC Gross Profit is not comparable to our gross profit and by definition ex-TAC Gross Profit presented for any period will be higher than our gross profit for that period.

The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 1,390 amortization expense of the non-cash based Commercial agreement asset. See Note 1b of Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.

Adjusted EBITDA and Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to ex-TAC Gross Profit

We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before finance income (expenses), net, income tax expenses, depreciation and amortization and non-cash amortization of the Commercial agreement asset, further
 adjusted to exclude share-based compensation including Connexity holdback compensation expenses and other noteworthy income and expense items such as M A costs and restructuring costs which may vary from period-to-period.

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us and others to measure our performance without regard to items such as share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash
 amortization of the Commercial agreement asset, and interest expense and other items that can vary substantially depending on our financing and capital structure, and the method by which assets are acquired. We use Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP
 financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies, and in communications with our board of directors. We may also use
 Adjusted EBITDA as a metric for determining payment of cash or other incentive compensation.

Limitations on the use of Adjusted EBITDA include the following:

Although depreciation expense is a non-cash charge, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital
 expenditure requirements;

Adjusted EBITDA excludes share-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect, to the extent applicable for a period presented: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or if
 applicable principal payments on debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and

The expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results.

Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss)

We calculate Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude revaluation of our Warrants liability, share-based compensation expense, including Connexity holdback compensation expenses, M A
 costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non-cash based Commercial agreement asset, foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses), net, and other noteworthy items that change from period to period and related tax effects.

We believe that Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) is useful because it allows us and others to measure our operating performance and trends without regard to items such as the revaluation of our Warrants liability,
 share-based compensation expense, cash and non-cash M A costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non-cash based Commercial agreement asset, foreign currency exchange rate (gains) losses, net and other noteworthy items that
 change from period to period and related tax effects. These items can vary substantially depending on our share price, acquisition activity, the method by which assets are acquired and other factors.

Limitations on the use of Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) include the following:

Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) excludes share-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation
 strategy;

Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) will generally be more favorable than our net income (loss) for the same period due to the nature of the items being excluded from its calculation; and

Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of liquidity.

Free Cash Flow

We calculate Free Cash Flow as Net cash flow provided by operating activities minus purchases of property, plant and equipment, including capitalized internal-use software.

We believe that Free Cash Flow is useful to provide management and others with information about the amount of cash generated from our operations that can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in
 our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening our balance sheet. We expect our Free Cash Flow to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to support our plans for growth.

Limitations on the use of Free Cash Flow include the following:

It should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. For example, cash is still required to satisfy other working capital needs, including short-term investment policy, restricted
 cash, repayment of loan and intangible assets;

Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities; and

This metric does not reflect our future contractual commitments.

Components of Our Results of Operations

Revenues

All of our Revenues are generated from Advertisers with whom we enter into commercial arrangements, defining the terms of our service and the basis for our charges. Generally, our charges are based on a CPC, CPM or
 CPA basis. For campaigns priced on a CPC basis, we recognize these Revenues when a user clicks on an advertisement we deliver. For campaigns priced on a CPM basis, we recognize these Revenues when an advertisement is displayed. For campaigns
 priced on a performance-based CPA basis, the Company generates revenue when a user makes an acquisition.

Table of Contents 

Cost of revenues

Our cost of revenue primarily includes traffic acquisition cost and also includes other cost of revenue.

Traffic acquisition cost

Traffic acquisition cost, or TAC, consists primarily of cost related to digital property compensation for placing our platform on their digital property and cost for advertising impressions purchased from real-time
 advertising exchanges and other third parties. Traffic acquisition cost also includes up-front payments, incentive payments, or bonuses paid to the digital property partners and the amortization of the non-cash based Commercial agreement asset
 (see Note 1b of Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements) which are amortized over the shorter of respective contractual terms and the economic benefit period of the digital property arrangement. For the majority of our
 digital properties partners, we have two primary compensation models for digital properties. The most common model is a revenue share model. In this model, we agree to pay a percentage of our revenue generated from advertisements placed on the
 digital properties. The second model includes guarantees. Under this model, we pay the greater of a percentage of the revenue generated or a committed guaranteed amount per thousand page views Minimum guarantee model ). Actual compensation is
 settled on a monthly basis. Expenses under both the revenue share model as well as the Minimum guarantee model are recorded as incurred, based on actual revenues generated by us at the respective month.

Other cost of revenues

Other cost of revenues includes data center and related costs, depreciation expense related to hardware supporting our platform, amortization expense related to capitalized internal-use software and acquired
 technology, digital and services taxes, content cost, personnel costs, and allocated facilities costs. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, share-based compensation, and employee benefit costs, and are primarily attributable to our
 operations group, which supports our platform and our Advertisers.

Gross profit

Gross profit, calculated as revenues less cost of revenues, has been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including fluctuations in the amount and mix of revenue and the amount and timing of
 investments to expand our digital properties partners and Advertisers base. We hope to increase both our Gross profit in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue through enhanced operational efficiency and economies of scale.

Research and development

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, share-based compensation and employee benefits costs, allocated facilities costs, professional services and
 depreciation. We expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods to support our growth, including continuing to invest in optimization, accuracy and reliability of our platform and other technology improvements to support
 and drive efficiency in our operations. These expenses may vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, depending primarily upon when we choose to make more significant investments.

Sales and marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist of payroll and other personnel related costs, including salaries, share-based compensation, employee benefits, and travel for our sales and marketing departments, advertising
 and promotion, rent and depreciation and amortization expenses, particularly related to the acquired intangibles. We expect to increase selling and marketing expenses to support the overall growth in our business.

General and administrative

General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and other personnel related costs, including salaries, share-based compensation, employee benefits and expenses for executive management, legal, finance and
 others. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees for professional services and occupancy costs. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase as we scale up headcount with the growth of our business, and as a
 result of operating as a public company, including compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, legal, audit, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services.

Finance income (expenses), net

Finance income (expenses), net, primarily consists of interest income (expense) including amortization of loan and credit facility issuance costs, Warrants liability fair value adjustments, gains (losses) from
 foreign exchange fluctuations and bank fees.

Income tax benefit (expenses)

The statutory corporate tax rate in Israel was 23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, although we are entitled to certain tax benefits under Israeli law.

Pursuant to the Israeli Law for Encouragement of Capital Investments-1959 (the Investments Law and its various amendments, under which we have been granted Privileged Enterprise status, we were granted a tax
 exemption status for the years 2018 and 2019.

For 2021 and subsequent tax years, we adopted the Preferred Technology Enterprises PTE Incentives Regime (Amendment 73 to the Investment Law) granting a 12 tax rate in central Israel on income deriving from
 benefited intangible assets, subject to a number of conditions being fulfilled, including a minimal amount or ratio of annual research and development expenditure and research and development employees, as well as having at least 25 of annual
 income derived from exports to large markets. PTE is defined as an enterprise which meets the aforementioned conditions and for which total consolidated revenues of its parent company and all subsidiaries are less than NIS 10 billion.

As of September 30, 2024, we have an accumulated tax loss carry-forward of approximately 64.5 million in Israel. The tax loss can be offset indefinitely. Non-Israeli subsidiaries are taxed according to the tax
 laws in their respective jurisdictions.

Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

Revenues increased by 72.8 million, or 20.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,
 2023. Existing digital property partners, including the growth of new digital property partners (beyond the revenue contribution determined based on the run-rate revenue generated by the partners when they are first on-boarded) increased by
 approximately 51.1 million. This increase was primarily driven by new revenue from advertisers transferred from Yahoo, as well as growth in spend from existing Taboola advertisers. New digital property partners contributed approximately 21.7
 million of new Revenues on a 12-month run rate basis calculated based on their first full month on the network.

Gross profit increased by 32.2 million, or 32.0 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Ex-TAC Gross Profit, a non-GAAP measure, increased by 36.6 million, or 28.5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
 three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to revenue from advertisers transferred from Yahoo, as well as growth in spend from existing Taboola advertisers.

Total cost of revenues increased by 40.6 million, or 15.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Traffic acquisition cost increased by 36.2 million, or 15.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Traffic acquisition cost increased at a rate lower than revenue primarily due to increased effective margin on our Yahoo partnership as a result
 of applying the mediation accruals as TAC offset rather than recognizing them as revenue.

The cost of guarantees (total payments due under guarantee arrangements in excess of amounts the Company would otherwise be required to pay under revenue sharing arrangements) as a percentage of traffic acquisition
 costs was approximately 20 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

Other cost of revenues increased by 4.4 million, or 15.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly as a result of a 2.8 million increase in
 data, content, communication and IT related expenses and a 0.9 million increase in employee related costs.

Table of Contents 

Research and development expenses increased by 0.8 million, or 2.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to depreciation
 expenses.

Sales and marketing expenses increased by 8.1 million, or 13.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to two factors. First, the year
 ago period was favorably impacted by a decrease in employee and subcontractors related costs. Second, employee and subcontractor headcount and related costs, including share-based compensation expenses, increased as we invested in resources to
 help support our revenue growth.

General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.1 million, or 0.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to decrease of
 0.3 million in credit losses expenses, partially offset by an increase of 0.2 million in employee and subcontractor headcount and related costs, including share-based compensation expenses.

Finance expenses, net decreased by 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly attributable to 1.6 million increase in foreign currency
 exchange rate gains, net, increase of 1.0 million due to Warrants liability devaluation and decrease of 0.8 million in interest expenses.

Income tax expenses increased by 9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher taxable income overall
 as well as adjustments in deferred tax expenses related to the U.S. entity.

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

Revenues increased by 255.3 million, or 25.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. New digital property partners contributed approximately 268.6
 million of new Revenues on a 12-month run rate basis calculated based on their first full month on the network. Existing digital property partners, including the growth of new digital property partners (beyond the revenue contribution determined
 based on the run-rate revenue generated by the partners when they are first on-boarded) decreased by approximately 13.3 million. This decrease was primarily driven by lower advertiser rates on existing digital property partners due to spend
 being served on new Yahoo supply added to the network partially mitigated by continued growth on Yahoo supply.

Gross profit increased by 69.3 million, or 24.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Ex-TAC Gross Profit, a non-GAAP measure, increased by 86.1 million, or 23.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to revenue from advertisers transferred from Yahoo, as well as growth in spend from existing Taboola advertisers.

Total cost of revenues increased by 186.0 million, or 25.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Traffic acquisition cost increased by 169.1 million, or 25.9 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The cost of guarantees (total payments due under guarantee arrangements in excess of amounts the Company would otherwise be required to pay under revenue sharing arrangements) as a percentage of traffic acquisition
 costs were approximately 19 and 20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Other cost of revenues increased by 16.8 million, or 21.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a 8.8 million increase in
 data, content, communication and IT related expenses, 3.4 million increase in depreciation expenses related to new product innovation and 2.8 million increase in digital service tax expenses.

Research and development expenses increased by 4.4 million, or 4.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to 2.5 million
 increase in employee and subcontractor headcount and related costs, including share-based compensation expenses, reflecting our continued effort to enhance our product offerings and a 1.7 million increase in depreciation expenses.

Sales and marketing expenses increased by 18.8 million, or 10.4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to 16.9 million increase
 in employee and subcontractor headcount and related costs, including share-based compensation expenses, supporting our growth, and 1.4 million in other marketing activities.

Table of Contents 

General and administrative expenses decreased by 5.1 million, or 6.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a result of a decrease of 2.3 million in
 insurance expenses in connection with the Yahoo arrangement, a decrease of 2.3 million in credit losses expenses and a decrease of 1.7 million in employee and subcontractors related costs, including share-based compensation expenses, and,
 partially offset by an increase of 1.1 million in depreciation expenses.

Finance expenses, net decreased by 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly attributable to 3.9 million Warrants liability devaluation
 and 3.8 million decrease in interest expense due to the voluntary repayments of a portion of the long-term loan in 2023.

Income tax expenses increased by 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher taxable income overall
 as well as adjustments in deferred tax expenses related to the U.S. entity.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash needs are for working capital, personnel costs, contractual obligations, including payments to digital property partners, office leases and software and information technology costs, capital
 expenditures for servers and capitalized software development, payment of interest and required principal payments on our long-term loan and other commitments. We fund these cash needs primarily from cash generated from operations, as well as
 from cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet when required. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated cash from operations of 122.4 million and 61.6 million, respectively.

As part of our growth strategy, we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and in our technology platform. We also plan to selectively consider possible future
 acquisitions that are attractive opportunities we deem strategic and value-enhancing. To fund our growth, depending on the magnitude and timing of our growth investments and the size and structure of any possible future acquisition, we may
 supplement our available cash from operations with issuances of equity or debt securities and/or make other borrowings, which could be material.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 217.2 million and 176.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively, and 5.4 million and 5.7 million in short and long-term restricted deposits,
 respectively, used, mainly, as security for our lease commitments and 5.7 million of short-term investments as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 we did not hold short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in
 banks and highly liquid marketable securities investments and money market funds, with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Short-term investments generally
 consist of bank deposits, U.S. government treasuries, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and U.S. agency bonds.

We believe that this, together with net proceeds from our engagements with Advertisers and digital property partners, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital and capital expenditure
 needs for at least the next 12 months. In the future, we may be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in order to support our continued capital expenditures and operations. In the event that additional financing is required from
 outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies, this could reduce our
 ability to compete successfully and harm our business, growth, and results of operations.

On August 9, 2022 we entered into an incremental revolving credit facility amendment to our existing senior secured credit agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement ). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for
 borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to 90.0 million (the Revolving Facility ). The proceeds of the Revolving Facility can be used to finance working capital needs and general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Revolving
 Facility are subject to customary borrowing conditions and will bear interest at a variable annual rate based on Term SOFR or Base Rate plus a fixed margin. The Amended Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and
 events of default as well as a financial covenant, which places a limit on our allowable net leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility.

As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding principal amount of debt under our long-term loan was 152.7 million with the remaining principal amount due at maturity on September 1, 2028.

Share Buyback Program

Our board of directors authorized a share buyback program for the repurchase of our outstanding Ordinary shares, which commenced in June 2023 and does not have an expiration date (the Buyback Program ). In 2023, our board of directors
 authorized up to 80.0 million of buybacks under the Buyback Program. In February 2024, our board of directors authorized up to 100.0 million for use under the Buyback Program, including any remaining authority from the 2023 board of directors
 authorization, subject to satisfying required conditions under the Israeli Companies Law and the Companies Regulations (Reliefs for Corporations, Which Securities Are Listed on Foreign Stock Exchanges), 2000. As permitted by the Buyback Program,
 share repurchases may be made from time to time, in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market, including through trading plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1, at the discretion of our management and as permitted by securities
 laws and other legal requirements, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Buyback Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and the number of shares repurchased may depend upon market and economic
 conditions and other factors. The Buyback Program may be discontinued, modified or suspended at any time.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 15.5 million of our shares consisting of 14.5 million Ordinary shares and 1.0 million Non-voting Ordinary shares at an average price of 4.14 per share (excluding broker and
 transaction fees of 0.4 million). As of September 30, 2024 the Company had remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase Ordinary shares up to an aggregate amount of 55.6 million, subject to satisfying required conditions
 under the Israeli Companies Law and the Companies Regulations. See Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, Note 9 and Note 12 of Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.

Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including the risks and uncertainties set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K under Item 1A. Risk Factors, and in our
 subsequent filings with the SEC.

The commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed,
 minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. The table does not include obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty. The table above does not reflect any
 reduction for prepaid obligations as of September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, we have a provision related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities totaling 9.5 million and other provisions related to severance pay and contribution plans, which have been excluded
 from the table above as we do not believe it is practicable to make reliable estimates of the periods in which payments for these obligations will be made.

Other Commercial Commitments

In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into agreements with certain digital properties, under which, in some cases we agree to pay them a guaranteed amount, generally per thousand page views on a monthly
 basis. These agreements could cause a gross loss on digital property accounts in which the guarantee is higher than the actual revenue generated. These contracts generally range in duration from 2 to 5 years, though some can be shorter or longer.
 These contracts are not included in the table above.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition results of operations are based upon our consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The preparation of our consolidated financial
 statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are
 reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Our critical accounting policies are those that materi ally affect our consolidated financial statements and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management.
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our 2023 Form 10-K .

To reduce the impact of foreign exchange risks associated with forecasted future cash flows related to payroll expenses and other personnel related costs denominated in NIS and
 their volatility, we have established a hedging program and use derivative financial instruments, specifically foreign currency forward contracts , call and put options, to manage exposure to foreign
 currency risks. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. 

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value or yield of fixed-income investments may decline if interest rates change.

Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held mainly for working capital purposes. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and the fulfillment of
 liquidity needs. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents
 and short-term investments, and the market value of those securities.

Table of Contents 

A s of September 30, 2024 , we had approximately 152.7 million of outstanding borrowings
 under our long-term loan with a variable interest rate. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for information regarding our incremental revolving credit facility amendment. 

Fluctuations in interest rates may impact the level of interest expense recorded on future borrowings. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, to
 effectively hedge the effect of interest rate changes or for speculative purposes.

Inflation Risk

The impacts of inflation have resulted in higher equipment and labor costs, consistent with its impact on the general economy. If our costs, in particular labor, sales and
 marketing, information system, technology and utilities costs, were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we might not be able to effectively mitigate such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely
 affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Credit Risk

Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally not significant, as we routinely assess the creditworthiness of our partners and Advertisers. Historically, we generally have not experienced any
 material losses related to receivables from Advertisers. We do not require collateral. Due to these factors, no additional credit risk beyond amounts provided for collection losses is believed by management to be probable in our accounts
 receivable.

As of September 30, 2024, we had a single customer representing 17.4 of the trade receivables balance. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a single customer accounted for 10.4 and
 12.3 , respectively, of total revenues. As of December 31, 2023, no single customer represented 10 or more of trade receivables. No single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30,
 2023. See Notes 2 and 12 of Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.

As of September 30, 2024, we maintained cash balances primarily in banks in the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel. In the United States and United Kingdom, the Company deposits are maintained with
 commercial banks, which are insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS ), which is authorized by the Bank of England (acting in its capacity as the Prudential Regulation
 Authority), respectively. In Israel, commercial banks do not have government-sponsored deposit insurance. Historically we have not experienced losses related to these balances and believe our credit risk in this area is reasonable. As of
 September 30, 2024, we maintained cash balances with U.S. and United Kingdom banks that significantly exceed FDIC and FSCS insurance limits and expect we will continue to do so. We regularly monitor bank financial strength and other factors in
 determining where to maintain cash deposits but may not be able to fully mitigate the risk of possible bank failures.

As of September 30, 2024 the Company did not hold short-term investments.

Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our
 counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across a number of major financial institutions. However, failure of one or more of these financial institutions is possible and could result in losses.
