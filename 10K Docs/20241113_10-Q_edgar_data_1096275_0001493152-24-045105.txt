 Notes
to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Unaudited) 

in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has generated only limited revenues and has
relied primarily upon capital generated from public and private offerings of its securities. Since the Company s acquisition of
Worksport in fiscal year 2014, it has never generated a profit. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of . 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had net losses of 
 (2023 - and (2023
- ).
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 
 (December 31, 2023)
and had an accumulated deficit of 
 (December 31, 2023 -).
The Company has not generated profit from operations since inception and to date has relied on debt and equity financing for continued
operations. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows from operations
and obtain equity and/or debt financing. The Company intends to continue funding operations through equity and debt financing arrangements,
which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements in the long term. There can be
no assurance that the steps management is taking will be successful. 

Despite
the Company having completed its purchasing of large manufacturing machinery for current output needs, operational costs are
expected to remain elevated and, thus, further decrease cash and cash equivalents. Concurrently, the Company intends to continue its
ramp-up of manufacturing and increasing sales volumes in 2024 and beyond, which should mitigate the effects of operational costs on cash and
cash equivalents; this view is supported by the fact that the manufacturing facility of the Company was completed for initial
production output in 2023 and started to generate revenue in the third quarter of 2023, registering its highest quarterly sales
total in the Company s history in the third quarter of 2024. 

The
Company has successfully raised cash and is positioned to do so again if deemed necessary or strategically advantageous. During the year
ended December 31, 2021, the Company, through its Reg-A public offering, private placement offering, underwritten public offering, and
exercises of warrants, raised an aggregate of approximately . On September 30, 2022, the Company filed a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 13, 2022, allowing the Company to issue up to of
common stock and prospectus supplement covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to of common stock that may be issued
and sold under an At The Market Offering Agreement dated September 30, 2022 ATM Agreement ), with H.C. Wainwright 
Co., LLC, as the sales agent HCW ). Pursuant to the ATM Agreement, HCW is entitled to a commission equal to of the
gross sales price of the shares of common stock sold. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has sold and issued shares of common
stock in consideration for net proceeds of under the ATM Agreement . 

On
November 2, 2023, the Company consummated a registered direct offering pursuant to which the Company issued shares of common
stock and pre-funded warrants to an institutional investor for a total net proceeds of . Concurrently with the registered
direct offering, the Company issued the same institutional investor warrants in a private sale. The warrants are exercisable
for shares of common stock for per share six months after issuance and until five and a half years from the issuance
date, subject to beneficial ownership limitations as described in the warrants. The Company registered the shares of common
stock underlying the warrants on a Form S-1 (333-276241) which was declared effective by the SEC on December 29, 2023. 

On
March 20, 2024, the Company consummated a registered direct offering pursuant to which the Company issued shares of common
stock and pre-funded warrants to the same institutional investor as in the Company s registered direct offering on November
2, 2023, for a total net proceeds of . Concurrently with the registered direct offering, the Company issued the institutional
investor warrants in a private sale. The warrants are exercisable for shares of common stock for per share
six months after issuance until five and a half years from the issuance date, subject to beneficial ownership limitations as described
in the warrants. The Company registered the shares of common stock underlying the warrants on a Form S-1 (333-278461) which
was declared effective by the SEC on April 8, 2024. 

To
date, the Company s principal sources of liquidity consist of net proceeds from public and private securities offerings and cash
exercises of outstanding warrants. Management is focused on transitioning towards revenue as its principal source of liquidity by growing
existing product offerings as well as the Company s customer base. The Company cannot give assurance that it can increase its cash
balances or limit its cash consumption and thus maintain sufficient cash balances for planned operations or future business developments.
Future business development and demands may lead to cash utilization at levels greater than recently experienced. The Company may need
to raise additional capital in the future. However, the Company cannot provide assurances it will be able to raise additional capital
on acceptable terms, or at all. 

The
Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Still, certain factors indicate
the existence of a material uncertainty that cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. These adjustments
could be material.

and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms Company and Worksport as used herein refers collectively
to Worksport Ltd. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and the condensed consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

Worksport
Ltd., through its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and owns the Intellectual Property on a portfolio of tonneau cover,
solar integration, portable power station, and NP (Non-Parasitic), Hydrogen-based green energy products and solutions for the automotive
aftermarket accessories, power storage, residential heating, and electric vehicle-charging industries. We seek to provide consumers with
next-generation automotive aftermarket accessories while capitalizing on growing consumer interest in clean energy solutions and power
grid independence. 

Rising
Popularity of Electric Vehicles 

Electric
Vehicles (EVs) have been exponentially increasing in consumer interest, whether that interest takes the form of vehicle pre-orders, sales,
or investments. As we begin marketing our Worksport SOLIS and COR, we plan to market the SOLIS as a must-have accessory for electric
light duty vehicle owners while simultaneously riding the coattails of EV popularity to promote our other products (COR and conventional
tonneau covers) to the very large population of Americans that have an interest in EVs without the funds to purchase them. Further, participating
in the EV space allows us to target consumers with an interest in cutting-edge technologies a great market in which to promote
our COR. 

Regulatory
Environment Favoring Electric Vehicles 

The
Build Back Better Bill was a strong indication of upcoming and favorable USA regulations. Many regulations that improve North America s
EV charging infrastructure or provide grants to businesses operating in the EV space will benefit us. While we are primarily focused
on the light duty vehicle market, our energy products are particularly useful for electric light duty pickup trucks and, therefore, are
positioned to benefit greatly from any bill that increases the prevalence of such vehicles. 

19 

Limited
Competitive Landscape 

Our
conventional tonneau covers are engineered for enhanced user experience and resistance to wear-and-tear, making them strong and competitive
products in an otherwise consolidated and saturated market. The Worksport COR, however, operates in a much wider yet unsaturated market.
The global Portable Power Station market is quickly growing, and the competitive landscape is far from consolidated. Even less consolidated,
the solar tonneau cover market is in its infancy, and it s a market in which we have first-mover advantage. To ensure we do not
fall behind future competitors, we are highly focused on protecting our intellectual property both domestically and abroad. 

Business
Developments 

The
following highlights recent material developments in our business in the three months ended September 30, 2024: 

On
 July 11, 2024, the Company launched a new dealer webpage to facilitate sales to tonneau cover dealers by offering a simplified ordering
 process. 

On
 July 19, 2024, the Company, as the guarantor, and Worksport New York Operations Corporation as well as Worksport USA Operations Corporation,
 entered into a 6,000,000 Revolving Financing and Assignment Agreement with an external lending entity with a maturity of 24 months
 from initial funding (July 2026). Upon transaction close, the Company drew down approximately 5.06 million of the Revolving Credit
 Facility, net of 790,000 of interest reserve required to be withheld to ensure interest payments by the Company. The Company used
 4.73 million of the drawn down amount to refinance the Company s mortgage on the Company s real property located at
 2500 North America Dr. in West Seneca, New York, and additionally drew approximately 330,000 to fund operations. 

On
 July 23, 2024, the Company engaged in stock option repricing for certain employees, executive officers, and members of the board
 of directors of the Company. All included options exercise prices were repriced to 0.7042 the closing price per share
 of the Company s Common Stock as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market on July 23, 2024. The Repriced Options consisted of certain
 outstanding stock options that had been granted under the Company s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan
 and 2022 Stock Incentive Plan as of the Effective Date. 

On
 August 6, 2024, through a partnership with Firework, the Company launched a new live sales feature to drive direct to consumer sales. 

On
 August 13, 2024, the Company hosted its first live earnings call. 

On
 September 3, 2024, the Company launched its new Dealer Sales Initiative, which represents a sharp expansion of its sales team to
 driver sales amount dealers. 

On
 September 4, 2024, the Company announced an expansion of it s product lines to service a wider range of truck models. 

On
 September 4, 2024, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Worksport USA Operations Corporation, entered into a 1,487,200
 credit and security agreement with an external lending entity with a maturity of 36 months from initial funding (September 2027).
 Upon transaction close, the Company received net proceeds of 1,437,998. The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Worksport New
 York Operations Corporation, serve as guarantors on the loan. 

On
 September 11, 2024, the Company published results from a lab test in which it found that the COR Hub + Battery, which carries over
 1.7 kWh of power, added approximately seven miles of range to a Tesla Model 3 when used as a Level 1 power source. 

Key
Factors Affecting our Performance 

As
a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable to our results of operations in future periods,
and our results of operations may not be directly comparable from period to period. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key
factors impacting our results of operations. 

Climate
Change 

Climate
change threatens to cause many foreseeable as well as unforeseeable ramifications. In cautious preparation for those that are foreseeable,
we have strategically begun domestic manufacturing operations in Western New York an economically growing region not immediately
threatened by climate change to the same extent as other regions and possibly one that may benefit from future population migrations
within the United States of America. Further, we intend to lower our own carbon footprint by investing in energy-saving measures in our
factory in West Seneca, NY. Considering climate change may also exacerbate geopolitical tensions, we are working to diversify our supply
chain and lower our reliance on any particular region or country for raw materials in order to lower our exposure to climate change-induced
economic or political instability. 

20 

We
believe our Worksport SOLIS and Worksport COR products will be received positively by the public for their resilience to, and even increased
utility as a result of, Climate Change. However, we acknowledge the potentially negative environmental impacts of poor battery recycling
and increasing demand for precious metals. We are actively researching ways to lower such environmental impacts. 

Inflation 

Prices
of certain commodity products, including raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes
in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, trade restrictions
and tariffs. Increasing prices of the component materials for parts of our goods may impact the availability, quality and price of our
products as suppliers search for alternatives to existing materials and increase the prices they charge. Our suppliers may also fail
to provide consistent quality of product as they may substitute lower cost materials to maintain pricing levels. Rapid and significant
changes in commodity prices may negatively affect our profit margins, and it may be difficult to mitigate worsened margins through customer
pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives. 

Such
an inflationary environment also increases our direct cost of raw goods or processed goods for our original equipment manufacturing as
well as indirect costs such as overhead and rent. Due to these present and forecasted price increases and the temporary increases in
ocean freight and container handling costs faced in recent periods, Worksport factors in all costs when assessing proper pricing of its
goods for sale. 

Additionally,
as central banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve increase interest rates to combat global inflation, the cost of debt financing increases.
While we currently do not have material debt other than our 6.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, our facility s variable rate
fluctuates along with the Prime Rate, meaning our monthly interest costs vary not only by our usage of the facility but by interest rates
as well. We continue to explore debt financing options at reasonable interest rates in order to strengthen our cash position. 

Elevated
interest rates have also resulted in a shift in institutional holdings away from micro-cap equities, which has negatively influenced
our stock s trading volume. We continue to forge relationships with institutional investors and analysts in order to maintain a
healthy trading volume. 

Inflation
has fallen since it s 2022 highs, although inflation rates are still above the Federal Reserve s target rate of 2 . Additionally,
for the first time since the Federal Reserves sharp post-Covid interest rate hike, during it s September meeting, the Federal
Reserve announced it is lowering the overnight borrowing rate by 50 basis points, and it gave guidance of an additional 50 basis point
cut by end of FY24. It is possible these interest rate cuts result in an increase in inflation. 

Gasoline
Prices and Supply Chain Issues 

We
faced significantly higher ocean freight, trucking, and container handling costs as well as last mile delivery costs in 2021 and 2022
than we did in previous years all of which have increased our products landed costs. Higher oil and gasoline prices further
increased these costs, and while such prices have come down from their 2022 highs, we continue to closely monitor gasoline and shipping
costs. While the Freight Rate Index has significantly increased since late 2023 as a result of Houthi attacks against cargo ships in
the Red Sea and the concurrent decline in activity across the Panama Canal, the shipping routes used by the Company have not faced dramatic
price hikes. Regardless, the Company is closely monitoring international shipping costs. Further, there is a risk of worker strikes within
our supply chain, such as the October US port workers strike that was postponed to January, 2025, causing higher import prices for our
raw materials and finished goods. 

We
are also identifying North American suppliers of our products components and will prioritize transport by rail when possible to
avoid high trucking costs. Our transition towards domestic manufacturing and assembly is anticipated to largely offset these higher costs,
as we believe we will be less exposed to higher international shipping costs. 

21 

Geopolitical
Conditions 

In
February 2022, Russia initiated significant military action against Ukraine. In response, the U.S. and certain other countries imposed
significant sanctions and export controls against Russia, Belarus and certain individuals and entities connected to Russian or Belarusian
political, business, and financial organizations, and the U.S. and certain other countries could impose further sanctions, trade restrictions,
and other retaliatory actions should the conflict continue or worsen. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of these
conflicts, including related geopolitical tensions, and the measures and retaliatory actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in
respect thereof as well as whether any counter measures or retaliatory actions in response, including, for example, potential cyberattacks
or the disruption of energy exports, are likely to cause regional instability and geopolitical shifts, which could materially adversely
affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. These situations remain uncertain, and while
it is difficult to predict the impact of any of the foregoing, the conflicts and actions taken in response to these conflicts could increase
our costs, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all,
or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

While
we do not have any direct operations or significant sales in the Middle East, geopolitical tensions and ongoing conflicts in the region,
particularly between Israel and Hamas, and more recently Israel and Hezbollah, may lead to global economic instability and fluctuating
energy prices that could materially affect our business. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of the Israeli wars,
including related geopolitical tensions, and the measures and actions taken by other countries in respect thereof, which could materially
adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. While it is difficult to predict the
impact of any of the foregoing, the Israeli wars may increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair
our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

Foreign
Currencies 

We
are subject to foreign exchange risk as we manufacture certain products and components in China, market extensively in both Canadian
and U.S. markets, employ people residing in both the U.S. and Canada and, to date, have raised funds in U.S. Dollars. Meanwhile, we report
results of operations in U.S. Dollars. Since some of our Canadian customers pay in Canadian Dollars, we are subject to gains and losses
due to fluctuations in the USD relative to the Canadian Dollar. Our manufacturers in China are paid in USD to better avoid the relatively
greater fluctuation of the Chinese Yuan. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against any of these foreign currencies, the translation
of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for our operations. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
Sales 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales from our entire line of products was 3,122,359, as compared to 458,483 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. Year-over-year net sales increased by approximately 581 . For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, net sales generated in Canada was 28,751 as compared to 4,225 for the same period in 2023. For the three months
ended September 30, 2024, net sales generated in the United States was 3,093,608 compared to 454,258 for the same period in 2023, an
increase of 581 . 

Net sales
increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year due to increased sales of tonneau
covers to a private label partner, various dealers and distributors, and end users via the Company s online marketplaces. The Company
continues to focus on establishing new and strengthening existing business-to-consumer and business-to-business sales channels while
also strengthening customer support to increase customer satisfaction and enable high product turnover. For business-to-consumer channels,
we have configured our product offerings in a manner conducive with cost-effective marketing, allowing us to securely invest in marketing
and sales campaigns. For business-to-business channels, we have created all necessary marketing/sales materials, policies, and teams
as well as an online dealer marketplace, and we are now actively contacting thousands of leads and presenting our product offerings to
various dealers, jobbers, and retailers across the United States and Canada. We intend to gradually increase output capacity through
refined production processes and increased personnel. 

22 

Net
sales from online retailers of our products increased from 21,599 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,594,368
during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Online retailers accounted for 51 of total net sales for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to 5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Distributor net sales increased for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023, with net sales of 114,681 and 4,225,
respectively. Distributors accounted for 4 of total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Private label net
sales increased from 432,659 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,413,310 for the three months ended September 30,
2024. Private label net sales accounted for 45 of total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to continue to
grow our fields of business as we develop unique products with enhanced utility to offer to other prospective clients in the U.S.
and Canadian markets. 

We
distribute our tonneau covers in Canada and the United States through an expanding network of wholesalers, private labels, distributors,
and online retail channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and our own e-commerce platform hosted on Shopify. Distribution via each
aforementioned channel is expected to increase during 2024. We have pursued and will continue to pursue relationships with Original Equipment
Manufacturers with the intention of distributing through them as well. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales increased by 680 , from 368,796 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2,875,186 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024. Our cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was approximately 92 and 80 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased primarily driven
by two factors: (1) strategic discounting aimed at boosting traffic to our direct-to-consumer online marketplace, and (2) overhead allocation
associated with sold inventory produced in previous periods, which had limited production volumes. Our discounting strategy is part of
a broader initiative to enhance market presence and build brand awareness. We anticipate that this will position us for sustained customer
engagement in future periods, during which discounting may not be necessary to the same extent. Additionally, overhead absorption was
higher due to the allocation of fixed costs over a smaller production volume in prior periods. As production volume grows and our manufacturing
process becomes more efficient, we expect to allocate these costs across a larger base. This scaling will be facilitated by reallocating
more of our existing human capital and machinery resources from design engineering and testing functions toward production. This shift
is intended to support ongoing production increases and drive long-term efficiencies in our cost structure. 

We
provide our distributors and online retailers an all-in wholesale price. This includes any import duty charges, taxes,
and shipping charges. Discounts are applied if the distributor or retailer chooses to use their own shipping process. Certain exceptions
apply on rare occasions where product is shipped outside the contiguous United Sates or from the United States to Canada. Volume discounts
are offered to certain high-volume customers, and we also offer a dock price or pickup program whereby clients
are able to pick up product directly from our stocking warehouse. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 143,193, from 4,009,196 for the three months ended September 30,
2023 to 4,152,389, due to the following factors: 

General
 and administrative expenses decreased by 216,233, from 3,091,488 in 2023 to 2,875,255 in 2024. General and administrative is constant
 with a slight decrease compared to prior year as the Company begins to shift its focus to production and research and development
 activities. 

Sales
 and marketing expenses increased by 280,391, from 380,847 for 2023 to 661,238 for 2024. The increase in sales and marketing is
 primarily attributable to the Company s marketing campaign to create brand and product awareness. 

Professional
 fees, which include accounting, legal, and consulting fees, increased from 539,126 in 2023 to 621,728 in 2024. The increase in
 professional fees was due primarily to payment of commissions to third parties, stock options modification, and
its associated fees. 

We
 realized a gain on foreign exchange of 5,832 during 2024, compared to a gain on foreign exchange of 2,265 for the prior period
 due to conversions between CAD and USD. 

23 

Other
Income and Expenses 

We
reported net other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 229,701, compared to a 29,789 for three months ended September
30, 2023. Net other expenses can be attributed to increased interest expense and decreased rental income. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,134,917, compared to a net loss of 3,949,298 for the three months ended September
30, 2023 an increase of 4.7 . The increase in the net loss can be attributed to the increase in various operating expenses as
we focus on expanding our operations, research and development, manufacturing, and supply chain. 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Net
Sales 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales from our entire line of products was 5,556,535, as compared to 690,259 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. Year-over-year net sales increased by approximately 705 . For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, net sales generated in Canada was 80,530 as compared to 6,961 for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, net sales generated in the United States was 5,476,005 compared to 683,298 for the same period in 2023, an
increase of 701 . 

Net
sales increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period the prior year due to increased net
sales of tonneau covers to a private label partner, various dealers and distributors, as well as end users via the Company s
online marketplaces. The Company continues to focus on establishing new and strengthening existing business-to-consumer and
business-to-business net sales channels while also strengthening customer support to increase customer satisfaction and enable high
product turnover. For business-to-consumer channels, we have configured our product offerings in a manner conducive to
cost-effective marketing, allowing us to securely invest in marketing and sales campaigns. For business-to-business channels, we
have created all necessary marketing/sales materials and policies as well as an online dealer marketplace, and we are now actively
contacting thousands of leads and presenting our product offerings to various dealers, jobbers, and retailers across the United
States and Canada. We intend to gradually increase output capacity through refined production processes and increased
personnel. 

Net
sales from online retailers of our products increased from 62,827 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2,446,053
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Online retailers accounted for 44 of total net sales for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to 9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Distributor net sales increased for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with net sales of 204,158 and 6,961,
respectively. Distributor net sales accounted for 4 of total net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Private label
net sales increased from 620,471 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2,906,324 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. Private label net sales accounted for 52 of total net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to
continue to grow our fields of business as we develop unique products with enhanced utility to offer to other prospective clients in
the U.S. and Canadian markets. 

We
distribute our tonneau covers in Canada and the United States through an expanding network of wholesalers, private labels, distributors,
and online retail channels, including eBay, Amazon, Walmart, and our own e-commerce platform hosted on Shopify. Distribution via each
aforementioned channel is expected to increase during 2024. We have pursued and will continue to pursue relationships with Original Equipment
Manufacturers with the intention of distributing through them as well. 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales increased by 818 , from 541,841 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 4,975,277 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. Our cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was approximately 89 and 78 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased primarily driven
by two factors: (1) strategic discounting aimed at boosting traffic to our direct-to-consumer online marketplace, and (2) overhead allocation
associated with sold inventory produced in previous periods, which had limited production volumes. Our discounting strategy is part of
a broader initiative to enhance market presence and build brand awareness. We anticipate that this will position us for sustained customer
engagement in future periods, during which discounting may not be necessary to the same extent. Additionally, overhead absorption was
higher due to the allocation of fixed costs over a smaller production volume in prior periods. As production volume grows and our manufacturing
process becomes more efficient, we expect to allocate these costs across a larger base. This scaling will be facilitated by reallocating
more of our existing human capital and machinery resources from design engineering and testing functions toward production. This shift
is intended to support ongoing production increases and drive long-term efficiencies in our cost structure. 

24 

We
provide our distributors and online retailers an all-in wholesale price. This includes any import duty charges, taxes,
and shipping charges. Discounts are applied if the distributor or retailer chooses to use their own shipping process. Certain exceptions
apply on rare occasions where product is shipped outside the contiguous United Sates or from the United States to Canada. Volume discounts
are offered to certain high-volume customers, and we also offer a dock price or pickup program whereby clients
are able to pick up product directly from our stocking warehouse. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 700,094, from 11,336,594 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 to 12,036,668, due to the following factors: 

General
 and administrative expenses increased by 1,530,058, from 6,965,901 in 2023 to 8,495,959 in 2024. The increase was related to increased
 research and development activities, increased employment of support personnel including engineers, and increases in wages and salaries
 as we seek to expand our operations and further develop our products. 

Sales
 and marketing expenses decreased by 267,103, from 1,473,910 for 2023 to 1,206,807 for 2024. The decrease in sales and marketing
 is primarily attributable to the completion of several marketing agreements and lower cost of in-house marketing campaigns to create
 brand and product awareness. 

Professional
 fees, which include accounting, legal, and consulting fees, decreased from 2,899,190 in 2023 to 2,332,069 in 2024. The decrease
 in professional fees was due primarily to insourcing of certain business processes and fewer equity grants to third parties for services
 rendered. 

We
 realized a loss on foreign exchange of 1,853 during 2024, compared to a gain on foreign exchange of 2,407 for the prior period
 due to conversions between CAD and USD. 

Other
Income and Expenses 

We
reported net other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 407,543, compared to net expenses of 81,847 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. Other expenses can be attributed to decreased interest and rental income. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11,862,973, compared to a net loss of 11,270,023 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 an increase of 5.3 . The increase in the net loss can be attributed to the increase in various operating expenses as
we focus on expanding our operations, research and development, manufacturing, and supply chain. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources; Going Concern 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 ,
the Company had a net loss of 4,134,917 (2023 3,949,298)
and 11,862,973 (2023 11,270,023),
respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has working capital of 5,880,926
 (December 31, 2023 1,956,894) and had an
accumulated deficit of 60,176,150 (December 31, 2023 48,313,177).
The Company has not generated profit from operations since inception and to date has relied on debt and equity financings for continued
operations. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows from operations
and obtain equity and/or debt financing. The Company intends to continue funding operations through equity and debt financing arrangements,
which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements in the long term. There can be
no assurance that the steps management is taking will be successful. 

25 

Despite
the Company having completed its purchasing of large manufacturing machinery for current output needs, operational costs are expected
to remain elevated and, thus, further decrease cash and cash equivalents. Concurrently, the Company intends to continue its ramp-up of
manufacturing and increasing sales volumes in the second half of 2024, which should mitigate the effects of operational costs on cash
and cash equivalents; this view is supported by the fact that the manufacturing facility of the Company was completed for initial production
output in 2023 and started to generate revenue in the third quarter of 2023, registering its highest quarterly sales total in the Company s
history in the third quarter of 2024. 

The
Company has successfully raised cash, and it is positioned to do so again if deemed necessary or strategically advantageous. During the
year ended December 31, 2021, the Company, through its Reg-A public offering, private placement offering, underwritten public offering,
and exercises of warrants, raised an aggregate of approximately 32,500,000. On September 30, 2022, the Company filed a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 13, 2022, allowing the Company to issue up to 30,000,000 of
common stock and prospectus supplement covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to 13,000,000 of common stock that may be issued
and sold under an At The Market Offering Agreement dated September 30, 2022 ATM Agreement ), with H.C. Wainwright 
Co., LLC, as the sales agent HCW ). Pursuant to the ATM Agreement, HCW is entitled to a commission equal to 3.0 of the
gross sales price of the shares of common stock sold. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has sold and issued 604,048 shares of common
stock in consideration for net proceeds of 780,356 under the ATM Agreement. 

On
November 2, 2023, the Company consummated a registered direct offering pursuant to which it sold 1,925,000 shares of common stock and
1,575,000 pre-funded warrants to an institutional investor for a total net proceeds of 4,261,542. Concurrently with the registered direct
offering, the Company issued the same institutional investor 7,000,000 warrants in a private sale. The warrants are exercisable for 7,000,000
shares of common stock for 1.34 per share six months after issuance until five and a half years from the issuance date, subject to beneficial
ownership limitations as described in the warrants. The Company registered the 7,000,000 shares of common stock underlying the warrants
on a Form S-1 (333-276241) which was declared effective by the SEC on December 29, 2023. 

On
March 20, 2024, the Company consummated a registered direct offering pursuant to which it sold 2,372,240 shares of common stock and 1,477,892
pre-funded warrants to the same institutional investor as in the Company s registered direct offering on November 2, 2023, for
total net proceeds of 2,629,083. Concurrently with the registered direct offering, the Company issued the institutional investor 7,700,264
warrants in a private sale. The warrants are exercisable for 7,700,264 shares of common stock for 0.74 per share six months after issuance
until five and a half years from the issuance date, subject to beneficial ownership limitations contained in the warrants. The Company
registered the 7,700,264 shares of common stock underlying the warrants on a Form S-1 (333-278461) which was declared effective by the
SEC on April 8, 2024. 

As
disclosed in the footnotes to our financial statements, on May 14, 2024, the Company and Worksport New York Operations Corporation entered
into an Omnibus Amendment of Loan Documents with Northeast Bank. This amendment pertains to the secured loan agreement dated May 4, 2022,
which was originally used to finance the purchase of our facility and land in West Seneca, New York. Effective as of May 10, 2024, the
Lender extended the maturity date of the loan from May 10, 2024, to August 10, 2024. This extension alleviated immediate cash flow pressures
by postponing the loan repayment, allowing us to manage our resources more effectively and focus on other operational needs. As part
of the Loan Amendment, we agreed to pay the Lender an extension fee of 106,000. This fee was deemed fully earned but was waived, as
the loan was repaid in full on or before the new maturity date. If the loan was not repaid by the extended maturity date or was accelerated
due to default, the fee would have become payable. Additionally, we agreed to an exit fee of 106,000 under similar conditions. This
fee was waived, as the loan was repaid on or before the new maturity date without acceleration. This loan extension demonstrates our
ability to negotiate favorable terms with our creditors and underscores our commitment to maintaining strong liquidity. This strategic
decision supported our long-term growth and helped us navigate the current economic and interest rate environment more effectively. The
details of the Loan Amendment have been filed as an exhibit to this report and are incorporated by reference herein. 

On
May 29, 2024, the Company entered into Inducement Offer Letter with a certain holder of existing warrants to purchase shares of the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of 1.34 per share issued on November 2, 2024, pursuant to which the Holder agreed to exercise for
cash its Existing Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, at a reduced exercised price
of 0.5198 per share, in consideration for the Company s agreement to issue new warrants to purchase up to 12,950,000 shares of
the Company s common stock at 0.5198 per share. The Company received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 3,638,600 from
the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Holder and the sale of the Inducement Warrants, before deducting placement agent fees and
other offering expenses payable by the Company. 

26 

On
July 19, 2024, t he Company, as the guarantor, and Worksport
New York Operations Corporation as well as Worksport USA Operations Corporation, entered into a 6 million Revolving Financing and Assignment
Agreement with an external lending entity, Amerisource Business Capital. Upon transaction close, the Company drew down approximately
 5.06 million of the Revolving Credit Facility, net of 790,000 of interest reserve required to be withheld to ensure interest payments
by the Company. The Company used 4.73 million of the drawn down amount to refinance the Company s mortgage on the Company s
real property located at 2500 North America Dr. in West Seneca, New York, and additionally drew approximately 330,000 to fund operations. 

On
September 4, 2024, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Worksport USA Operations Corporation, entered into a 1,487,200
credit and security agreement with an external lending entity with a maturity of 36 months from initial funding (September 2027). Upon
transaction close, the Company received net proceeds of 1,437,998. The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Worksport New York Operations
Corporation, serve as guarantors on the loan. 

To
date, the Company s principal sources of liquidity consist of net proceeds from public and private securities offerings and cash
exercises of outstanding warrants. Management is focused on transitioning towards revenue as its principal source of liquidity by growing
existing product offerings as well as the Company s customer base. The Company cannot give assurance that it can increase its cash
balances or limit its cash consumption and thus maintain sufficient cash balances for planned operations or future business developments.
Future business development and demands may lead to cash utilization at levels greater than recently experienced. The Company may need
to raise additional capital in the future. However, the Company cannot provide assurances it will be able to raise additional capital
on acceptable terms, or at all. 

The
Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Still, certain factors indicate
the existence of a material uncertainty that cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. These adjustments
could be material. 

Cash
Flow Activities 

Cash
decreased from 3,365,778 at December 31, 2023, to 1,857,685 at September 30, 2024 a decrease of 1,508,093 or 45 . 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had current assets of 8,887,057 (December 31, 2023 9,123,506) and current liabilities of 3,006,131
(December 31, 2023 7,166,612). As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 5,880,926 (December 31, 2023 1,956,894)
and an accumulated deficit of 60,176,150 (December 31, 2023 48,313,177). 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 7,959,212, compared to 8,194,347 in the prior period.
While net loss increased by 592,950 and non-cash payments decreased by 1,585,718, they were more than offset by a 2,413,803 decrease
in cash used in operating assets and liabilities relative to the prior period, which reflects the Company s improved inventory
storage and consumption efficiency. 

Accounts
receivable increased at September 30, 2024 by 3,320 and increased by 455,509 in the prior period. This small increase relative to the
prior period was due to there being a small increase in business-to-business sales relative to the prior period. 

Inventory
increased at September 30, 2024 by 2,506,568, and at September 30, 2023 by 2,205,697, as a result of our purchasing more raw materials
for increased output to fulfill rising demand for our domestically-produced tonneau covers. Prepaid expenses and deposits decreased by
 1,240,649 at September 30, 2024, and decreased by 26,200 at September 30, 2023 due to deposits
used and made by us for the purchase of inventory. 

Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities increased at September 30, 2024 by 1,004,819 compared to a decrease of 152,474 in the prior period. 

27 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 500,760 compared to 3,512,469 in the prior period.
The decrease in investing activities was primarily attributable to higher capital expenditure on various manufacturing equipment in 2023. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash generated by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6,951,879 compared to net cash generated by
financing activities of 51,637 in the prior period. Cash generated from financing activities increased as the Company issued additional
shares, warrants and access to credit lines compared to 2023. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on
an ongoing basis, including those related to provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventories, valuation of intangible assets
and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. 

The
accounting policies that we follow are set forth in Note 2 to our financial statements as included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form
10-K filed on March 27, 2024. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and
have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the quarter covered in this report, our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time and is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, cannot
provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 

To
address the material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure our consolidated
financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including pending opposition proceedings involving
patents that arise in the ordinary course of business. We are not presently a party to any material pending or threatened legal proceedings,
nor do we have any knowledge of any such pending claims. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed
in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023
Annual Report ), which could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, or future results. The risks described
in our 2023 Annual Report are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or
that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or future results. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

On
 May 31, 2024, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 12,950,000 shares of the Company s common stock in connection with
 entering into the Inducement Offer Letter with a certain holder of existing warrants, pursuant to which the Holder agreed to exercise
 for cash its Existing Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, at a reduced exercised
 price of 0.5198 per share. Each Inducement Warrant has an exercise price equal to 0.5198 per share and will be exercisable at any
 time on or after the date that is six (6) months from the issuance date provided that stockholder approval is obtained and will have
 a term of exercise of five and one half (5 years following the date of issuance. The Company engaged Maxim Group LLC Maxim to act as its exclusive warrant solicitation agent and financial advisor in connection with the warrant inducement transaction and
 paid Maxim a cash fee equal to 7.0 of the gross proceeds received from the exercise of the Existing Warrants. The Company used and
 is expecting to use the net proceeds of these transactions for general corporate purposes, including working capital. 

The
issuance of the warrants listed above was deemed exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D
promulgated thereunder in that the issuance of securities were made to an accredited investor and did not involve a public offering.
The recipient of such securities represented its intention to acquire the securities for investment purposes only and not with a view
to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof.

5. Other Information 

On
May 14, 2024, the Company and Worksport New York Operations Corporation entered into an Omnibus Amendment of Loan Documents with Northeast
Bank in connection with that certain secured loan agreement, dated May 4, 2022, by and among the Company, as the guarantor, Worksport
New York, as the borrower, and the Lender in connection with the Company s purchase of its 152,847 square foot facility and 18
acres of land in West Seneca, New York on May 6, 2022 for a total purchase price of 8,150,000. Pursuant to the Loan Amendment, effective
as of May 10, 2024, the Lender extended the initial maturity date of the Loan from May 10, 2024 to August 10, 2024. The Company also
agreed to pay the Lender an extension fee of 106,000 which was deemed fully earned as of the date of the Loan Amendment. However, the
Lender agreed to postpone payment of the Extension Fee until the occurrence of (i) the Loan not being repaid in full by or on the Extended
Maturity Date; or (ii) Loan being accelerated following an Event of Default or Termination Date (as defined in the Forbearance Agreement).
If the Loan is repaid in full on or prior to the Extended Maturity Date, the Lender has agreed to waive the Extension Fee. In addition
to the Extension Fee, the Company agreed to pay the Lender an exit fee of 106,000 (the Exit Fee in the event the Loan
is not repaid in full on or prior to the Extended Maturity Date or if the Loan has been accelerated following an Event of Default or
in connection with a Termination Event (as defined in the Forbearance Agreement). If the Loan is repaid in full on or prior to the Extended
Maturity Date (and not as a result of an acceleration following a Termination Event), the Company will not be required to pay the Exit
Fee.
