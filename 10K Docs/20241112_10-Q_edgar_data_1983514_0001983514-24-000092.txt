 and continues thereafter from year to year if approved annually by the Board of Directors or the Company s unitholders, including, in each case, a majority of the directors who are not interested persons as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the Independent Directors ). 
 
 The Company pays the Investment Adviser a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee are ultimately be borne by the unitholders. 
 Base Management Fee 
 
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s average net asset value at the end of the two most recently completed calendar months. All or part of the base management fee not taken as to any month will be deferred without interest and may be taken in any subsequent month prior to the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, and any such recoupment would be subject to any applicable expense waiver. Base management fees for any partial month are prorated based on the number of days in the month. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears, any base management fees waived are not subject to recoupment by the Investment Adviser. The Investment Adviser has agreed to irrevocably waive the base management fee through September 30, 2024, and such waiver is not subject to recapture. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 base management fees were and , and the Investment Adviser irrevocably agreed to waive and , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from February 7, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, base management fees were and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, was payable to the Investment Adviser relating to base management fees. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee consists of two components that are determined independently of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. One component is based on income and the other component is based on capital gains. 
 i. Incentive Fees based on Income 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income is defined as interest income, distribution income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter, including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below) and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred units, but excluding the incentive fee and any servicing fees and/or distribution fees paid to broker dealers. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash.

 The significant unobservable input used in yield analysis is discount rate based on comparable market yields. Significant increases in discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the market approach is the comparable company multiple. The multiple is used to estimate the enterprise value of the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the multiple would result in an increase/decrease, respectively, in the fair value. The comparative yield and discount rate are used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment. An increase/decrease in the comparative yield or discount rate would result in a decrease/increase, respectively, in the fair value.

 OVERVIEW 
 We are a Delaware limited liability company formed on February 7, 2023 with the name LTMS Fund LLC. We changed our name to LGAM Private Credit LLC on March 20, 2023. We are structured as a non-diversified, externally managed specialty finance company focused on lending to middle market companies. We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we intend to elect to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. We are not a subsidiary of or consolidated with Morgan Stanley. We commenced operations on December 1, 2023. 
 We are a private, perpetual-life BDC, which is a BDC whose Units are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. We use the term perpetual-life BDC to describe an investment vehicle of indefinite duration whose units are intended to be sold by us monthly on a continuous basis at a price generally equal to our monthly net asset value per Unit. 
 Our investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns via current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by investing primarily in directly originated senior secured term loans issued by U.S. middle market companies in which private equity sponsors have a controlling equity stake in the portfolio company. For purposes of this Report, middle market companies refers to companies that, in general, generate annual earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization EBITDA in the range of approximately 15 million to 200 million, although not all of our portfolio companies will meet this criterion. 
 We invest primarily in directly originated senior secured term loans including first lien senior secured term loans (including unitranche loans) and, second lien senior secured term loans, with the balance of our investments expected to be in higher-yielding assets such as mezzanine debt, unsecured debt, equity investments and other opportunistic asset purchases. Typical middle market senior loans may be issued by middle market companies in the context of leveraged buyouts LBOs ), acquisitions, debt refinancings, recapitalizations, and other similar transactions. We generally expect our debt investments to have a stated term of five to eight years and typically to bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark (such as SOFR). We may make investments in traded bank loans and other liquid debt securities of U.S. corporate issuers, including broadly syndicated loans, which may provide more liquidity than our private credit investments, for cash management purposes, including to manage payment obligations under our unit repurchase program. Depending on various factors, including our cash flows and the market for middle market company debt investments, we expect that our liquid loan portfolio could represent a material portion of our investments from time to time. 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends or distributions of income on any direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of loans and equity investments and various other loan origination and other fees, including commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. 
 Pursuant to the exemptive relief granted by the SEC to our Adviser (as amended, the Order ), we are able to enter into certain negotiated co-investment transactions alongside certain Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds (each as defined in the Order) in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies, and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with the Order. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our eligible directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our unitholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our unitholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our unitholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies. 
 
 We have applied for a new exemptive relief order which, if granted, would supersede the Order and would permit us greater flexibility with respect to negotiated co-investment transactions alongside certain Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds (each as defined in the application). There can be no assurance that we will obtain such new exemptive relief from the SEC. 
 
 KEY COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt available to middle market companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends or distributions of income on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of five to eight years and typically to bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark such as SOFR. Interest on these debt investments will 
 38

 generally be payable quarterly. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we may receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees.

Weighted average EBITDA, net leverage through the tranche that the Company is a lender, interest coverage and loan to value exclude recurring revenue investments, which are investments in portfolio companies in which the Company lends based on a multiple of recurring revenue generated by the portfolio company and not based on a multiple of EBITDA. 
 (2) Amounts were derived from investment due diligence information provided by the portfolio company. Such amounts have not been independently estimated by us, and accordingly, we take no responsibility for such numbers and make no representation or warranty in respect of this information. 
 (3) Computed as (a) the annual stated spread, plus reference rate, as applicable, plus the annual accretion of discounts, as applicable on debt securities divided by (b) total debt investments (at fair value or cost, as applicable) included in such securities. Actual yields earned over the life of each investment could differ materially from the yields presented herein. 
 (4) Net leverage is the ratio of total debt minus cash divided by EBITDA and taking into account leverage through the tranche that the Company is a lender, excluding recurring revenue investments. 
 (5) Interest coverage for a particular portfolio company is calculated by taking credit agreement EBITDA and dividing by annualized latest reported interest expense. Total interest coverage is calculated on a weighted average basis based on total gross debt commitments (funded and unfunded). Calculation excludes recurring revenue deals which are investments in portfolio companies in which the Company lends based on a multiple of recurring revenue generated by the portfolio company and not based on a multiple of EBITDA. Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. 
 (6) Calculated using total outstanding debt through the tranche that the Company is a lender divided by total enterprise value from the private equity sponsor or market comparables.

 Investment Performance Rating 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser has developed risk policies pursuant to which it regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our debt investments. Our Investment Adviser has developed a classification system to group investments into four categories. The investments are evaluated regularly and assigned a category based on certain credit metrics. Our Investment Adviser s ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. Please see below for a description of the four categories of the Investment Adviser s Internal Risk Rating system: 
 Risk Rating 1 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 1 involve the least amount of risk relative to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Risk Rating 1 investments performance is above our initial underwriting expectations and the business trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company, or the likelihood of a potential exit. 
 Risk Rating 2 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 2 involve a level of risk relative to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. Risk Rating 2 investments are generally performing in line with our initial underwriting expectations and risk factors to ultimately recoup the cost of our principal investment are neutral to favorable. All new originated or acquired investments are initially included in Risk Rating 2. 
 Risk Rating 3 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 3 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition has increased materially since the origination or acquisition of the investment, such as declining financial performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, principal and interest payments are not more than 120 days past due. 
 Risk Rating 4 In the opinion of our Investment Adviser, investments in Risk Rating 4 involve a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicate that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For Risk Rating 4 investments, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition upon exit. 
 The distribution of our portfolio on the Investment Adviser s Internal Risk Rating System is as follows:

 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We generate cash from the net proceeds of offerings of our Units, net borrowings from our credit facility, and from cash flows from interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. We may also fund a portion of our investments through borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities, including before we have fully invested the proceeds of any closing of our continuous private offering of our Units. Our primary use of cash is investments in portfolio companies, payments of our expenses, funding repurchases under our unit repurchase program and payment of cash distributions to our unitholders. Details of our credit facility is described in Debt below. We may also from time to time enter into new credit facilities, increase the size of existing credit facility or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 4.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, which taken together with our approximately 92.4 million of availability under the Citibank Funding Facility (subject to borrowing base availability) (as defined in Note 6. Debt in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements), respectively, we expect to be sufficient for our investing activities and sufficient to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we believed we had adequate financial resources to satisfy unfunded portfolio company commitments of 51.1 million. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

 The Company did not declare a distribution for the period from February 7, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023. 
 Distribution Reinvestment 
 We have adopted an opt in dividend reinvestment plan DRIP ). As a result, if we declare a cash distribution, unitholders that specifically opt in to the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional Units. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and for the period from February 7, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, we did not issue any Units pursuant to our DRIP. For further details, see Note 8 Members Capital to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Unit Repurchase Program 
 At the discretion of the Board of Directors, we may repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of the outstanding Units (either by number of units or aggregate net asset value) as of such quarter end pursuant to a quarterly unit repurchase program. The limitations and restrictions described in the applicable offer to repurchase units may prevent us from accommodating all repurchase requests made in any quarter. The unit repurchase program has many limitations, including the limitations described above, and should not in any way be viewed as the equivalent of a secondary market. We will offer to repurchase Units on such terms as may be determined by our Board of Directors in its complete and absolute discretion. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the period from February 7, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, no units were repurchased. 
 For further details, see Note 8 Members Capital to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting estimates including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, including Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
 We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Investments, Revenue Recognition, Deferred Financing Costs and Debt Issuance Costs and Income Taxes. The valuation of investments is our most significant critical estimate. The most significant input is the discount rate used in yield analysis that is based on comparable market yields. Significant increases in the discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. For a further discussion and disclosure of key inputs and considerations related to this estimate, refer to "Note 5 Fair Value Measurements" included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following (which are defined in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements if not defined herein): 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; 
 the Administration Agreement; and 
 the Expense Support Agreement. 
 For further details see Note 3. Related Party Transactions t o our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, market risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of portfolio companies. During periods of market dislocation, we will seek to invest prudently in the secondary loan market to provide our investors better risk adjusted returns while adhering to our core investment tenants. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price. To ensure accurate valuations, our investments are valued at fair value in good faith by our Board of Directors, based on, among other things, the input of the Investment Adviser, including the Valuation Designee, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of our Board of Directors, or our Valuation Designee, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the investments we hold. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Market Risk 
 The market value of a security may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. These fluctuations may cause a security to be worth less than the price originally paid for it, or less than it was worth at an earlier time. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, sector of the economy or the market as a whole. Global economies and financial markets are increasingly interconnected, which increases the probabilities that conditions in one country or region might adversely impact issuers in a different country or region. Conditions affecting the general economy, including political, social, or economic instability at the local, regional, or global level, may also affect the market value of a security. Health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases, as well as other incidents that interrupt the expected course of events, such as natural disasters, war or civil disturbance, acts of terrorism, power outages and other unforeseeable and external events, and the public response to or fear of such diseases or events, have and may in the future have an adverse effect on a company s investments and net asset value and can lead to increased market volatility. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors General Risk Factors We are operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty. The conditions have materially and adversely affected debt and equity capital markets in the United States, and any future volatility or instability in capital markets may have a negative impact on our business and operations. of our Form 10-K and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors General Risk Factors Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, outbreaks or pandemics, such as the Coronavirus pandemic, may impact our portfolio companies and our Adviser and harm our business, operating results and financial condition of our Form 10-K.

 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 99.7 of our debt investments were at floating rates. Based on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical reference rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors and ceilings for floating rate debt instruments assuming no changes in our investments and borrowing structure as of September 30, 2024) (dollar amounts in thousands): 
 Interest Interest Net Basis Point Change - Interest Rates Income Expense Income Up 300 basis points 6,850 (3,228) 3,622 Up 200 basis points 4,566 (2,152) 2,414 Up 100 basis points 2,283 (1,076) 1,207 Up 25 basis points 571 (269) 302 Down 25 basis points (571) 269 (302) Down 100 basis points (2,283) 1,076 (1,207) Down 200 basis points (4,566) 2,152 (2,414) Down 300 basis points (6,850) 3,228 (3,622) 
 We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or our credit facilities, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates or investments denominated in foreign currencies. During the periods covered by this Report, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them of material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
