 (UNAUDITED) 

restricted
stock units RSUs have been granted under the 2024 Plan. As of September 30, 2024, the unamortized value related to
 grants under the 2024 Plan was . 

As
part of an employment agreement, the Company granted (the Prior Grant to an executive a one-time equity award of 
restricted stock units RSUs of the Company s common stock valued at , fair value, which award was originally
set to vest in its entirety on August 18, 2024. The fair market value of the restricted stock award was determined based on the closing
price of the Company s common stock on the grant date and was expensed on a straight-line
basis to general and administrative expense as stock-based compensation over the one-year vesting term. The Company recorded stock-based
compensation expense of and for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Under the original terms of the award, to the extent the Company had
not established an employee equity compensation plan on or prior to August 18, 2024, the restricted shares may have been converted, at
the election of the executive, in full or in part, into cash compensation, at a rate of per share of common stock, which was the
fair market value of the common stock on October 10, 2023, which was the date the Board of Directors approved the grant. Since the issuance
of the restricted stock can be settled in cash, the monthly expense was credited to a liability account, stock compensation liability,
instead of equity. 

 On August 16, 2024, the executive agreed
to cancel and forfeit the Prior Grant and, in lieu of the Prior Grant, the Company granted the executive 
 RSUs Replacement Grant ), pursuant to and subject to the 2024 Plan and an award agreement, as approved by the Board
of Directors. The fair market value of the replacement grant was ,
which was determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date. The shares of common stock underlying
the Replacement Grant shall vest ratably and quarterly over a two-year period beginning on the Replacement Grant date, August 16, 2024.
The cancellation and issuance of the Replacement Grant is treated as a modification of an award under FASB ASC 718. This modification
resulted in an incremental fair value of 1,410,000, calculated as the difference between the fair value of the Replacement Grant and
the fair value of the Prior Grant on the modification date. The incremental fair value will be recognized as additional compensation
expense on a straight-line basis over the new two-year vesting period. The Company will relieve the stock compensation liability on a
proportional basis as the Replacement Grant vests.

from two of the three licensees representing the present value of fixed guaranteed royalty payments that will
be payable over varying periods of two through five years that commenced in the second half of 2022 and terminate in the second quarter
of 2028. The fixed guaranteed royalty payments result from amendments to license agreements with two existing licensees and a license
agreement with a new licensee. The receivable represents the present value of the fixed minimum annual payments due under the license
agreements, discounted at the Company's incremental borrowing rate of . 

The three agreements grant licenses for the use of
certain patented ink technology as it exists at the time that it is granted which is considered functional intellectual property. Under
Topic 606, a performance obligation to transfer a license for functional intellectual property is satisfied at a point in time and the
fixed consideration could be recognized upfront when the Company transfers control of the licensee if certain criteria are met. Specifically,
the minimum royalty guarantee could be recognized upfront if the following conditions are met: 

The royalty payment is fixed or determinable 

Collection of the royalty payment is considered probable 

The licensee has the ability to benefit from the licensed technology 

The
Company determined that the above conditions were met upon execution of the 2022 license agreements and recognized of

receivables will not be impaired in the future due to changes in the licensees financial condition or other factors. 

The long-term receivables are recorded at its present
value as of September 30, 2024, and the receivable and imputed interest will be amortized over the term of the license agreements using

Background Overview 

Nocopi Technologies, Inc. develops
and markets specialty reactive inks for applications in the large educational and toy products market. We also develop and market technologies
for document and product authentication, which we believe can reduce losses caused by fraudulent document reproduction or by product counterfeiting
and/or diversion. We derive our revenues primarily from licensing our technologies on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis to licensees
who incorporate our technologies into their product offering and from selling products incorporating our technologies to the licensees
or to their licensed printers. 

Unless the context otherwise requires,
all references to the Compan y , we, our or us and other similar terms means
Nocopi Technologies, Inc., a Maryland corporation. 

Results of Operations 

The Company s revenues are
derived from (a) royalties paid by licensees of our technologies, (b) fees for the provision of technical services to licensees and (c)
from the direct sale of (i) products incorporating our technologies, such as inks, security paper and pressure sensitive labels, and (ii)
equipment used to support the application of our technologies, such as ink-jet printing systems. Royalties consist of guaranteed minimum
royalties payable by our licensees in certain cases and additional royalties which typically vary with the licensee s sales or production
of products incorporating the licensed technology. Service fees and sales revenues vary directly with the number of units of service or
product provided. 

The Company recognizes revenue
on its lines of business as follows: 

a. 
 License fees for the use of our technology and royalties with guaranteed minimum amounts are recognized at a point in time when the term begins; 

b. 
 Product sales are recognized at the time of the transfer of goods to customers at an amount that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for these goods, which is at the time of shipment; and 

c. 
 Fees for technical services are recognized at the time of the transfer of services to customers at an amount that the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the services, which is when the service has been rendered. 

We believe that, as fixed cost
reductions beyond those we have achieved in recent years may not be achievable, our operating results are substantially dependent on revenue
levels. Because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues, operating results
are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix. 

Both the absolute amount of the
Company s revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation. We have a relatively
small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers. Accordingly, changes in the revenue received from
a significant customer can have a substantial effect on the Company s total revenue, revenue mix and overall financial performance.
Such changes may result from a substantial customer s product development delays, engineering changes, changes in product marketing
strategies, production requirements and the like. In addition, certain customers have, from time to time, sought to renegotiate certain
provisions of their license agreements and, when the Company agrees to revise such terms, revenues from the customer may be adversely
affected.

Revenues for the third quarter
of 2024 were 668,400 compared to 575,100 in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 93,300, or approximately 16 . Licenses, royalties
and fees increased by 14,600, or approximately 11 , to 151,500 in the third quarter of 2024 from 136,900 in the third quarter of 2023.
The increase in licenses, royalties and fees in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is due primarily to higher
royalties from the Company s licensees in entertainment and toy products markets. We cannot assure you that the marketing and product
development activities of the Company s licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce
a significant increase in revenues for the Company, nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted, particularly given
the uncertain economic conditions presently being experienced. 

Product
and other sales increased by 78,700, or approximately 18 , to 516,900 in the third quarter of 2024 from 438,200 in the third quarter
of 2023. Sales of ink increased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to more ink shipments
to the third party authorized printer used by two of the Company s major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market.
In the third quarter of 2024, the Company derived revenues of approximately 648,600 from our licensees and their authorized printers
in the entertainment and toy products market compared to revenues of approximately 566,100 in the third quarter of 2023. 

For the first nine months
of 2024, revenues were 1,525,700, representing a decrease of 240,700, or approximately 14 , from revenues of 1,766,400 in the first
nine months of 2023. Licenses, royalties and fees decreased by 83,100, or approximately 20 , to 327,000 in the first nine months of
2024 from 410,100 in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in licenses, royalties and fees is due primarily to lower royalties
from the Company s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. We cannot assure you that the marketing and product development
activities of the Company s licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce a significant
increase in revenues for the Company, nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted, particularly given the uncertain
economic conditions presently being experienced. 

Product
and other sales decreased by 157,600, or approximately 13 , to 1,198,700 in the first nine months of 2024 from 1,356,300 in the first
nine months of 2023. Sales of ink decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine of 2023 due primarily to lower
ink shipments to the third party authorized printer used by two of the Company s major licensees in the entertainment and toy products
market. The Company derived revenues of approximately 1,469,300 from licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and
toy products market in the first nine months of 2024 compared to revenues of approximately 1,687,700 in the first nine months of 2023. 

The Company s gross profit
increased to 380,300 in the third quarter of 2024, or approximately 57 of revenues, from 265,100 in the third quarter of 2023, or approximately
46 of revenues. Licenses, royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product and other sales, which generally
consist of supplies or other manufactured products which incorporate the Company s technologies or equipment used to support the
application of its technologies. These items (except for inks which are manufactured by the Company) are generally purchased from third-party
vendors and resold to the end-user or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses, royalties and fees. 

For the first nine months of 2024,
gross profit was 776,200, or approximately 51 of revenues, compared to 946,900, or approximately 54 of revenues, in the first nine
months of 2023. The lower gross profit in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to
a decrease in gross profit from both licenses, royalties and fees and product and other sales. 

As the variable component of cost
of revenues related to licenses, royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial,
period to period changes in revenues from licenses, royalties and fees can significantly affect both the gross profit from licenses, royalties
and fees as well as overall gross profit. The gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees increased to approximately 61 in the third
quarter of 2024 compared to approximately 54 in the third quarter of 2023 and decreased to approximately 50 of revenues from licenses,
royalties and fees in the first nine months of 2024 from approximately 58 in the first nine months of 2023. 

13 

The gross profit, expressed as
a percentage of revenues, of product and other sales is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on
the mix of the specific goods produced and/or sold. The gross profit from product and other sales increased to approximately 56 of revenues
in the third quarter of 2024 compared to approximately 44 of revenues in the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024,
the gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased to approximately 51 of revenues from product and other sales compared
to approximately 52 of revenues from product and other sales in the first nine months of 2023 

Research
and development expenses increased in the third quarter of 2024 to 43,600 from 39,800 in the third quarter of 2023 and to 127,100 in
the first nine months of 2024 from 119,900 in the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to higher employee related and lab expenses
in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. 

Sales
and marketing expenses increased to 91,600 in the third quarter of 2024 from 71,200 in the third quarter of 2023 and increased to 236,500
in the first nine months of 2024 from 218,600 in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in the third quarter and first nine months
of 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 is due primarily to higher commission and
employee related expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

General and administrative expenses
decreased in the third quarter of 2024 to 727,400 from 833,800 in the third quarter of 2023 and increased to 3,196,900 in the first
nine months of 2024 from 1,258,300 in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in the third quarter is due primarily to lower employee
related expenses and professional fees in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the first nine
months is due primarily to higher stock-based compensation, higher professional fees, and higher employee related expenses in the first
nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 

For the third quarter of 2024,
there was no income tax benefit for the net losses for the third quarter of 2024 due to the recording of a full valuation allowance since
it is more likely than not that that the realization of the net deferred tax assets would not be realized. Income taxes in the third quarter
of 2024 include federal and state income taxes. The state income taxes result from limitations placed on income tax net operating loss
deductions by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 

The
net loss of 251,100 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss of 453,300 in the third quarter of 2023 resulted primarily
from a higher gross profit on a higher level of licenses, royalties and fees and product sales, lower operating expenses and higher
interest income, other income and no income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The net
loss of 2,284,700 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to a net loss of 343,900 in the first nine months of 2023 resulted
primarily from a lower gross profit on a lower level of license, royalties, and fees and product sales in the first nine months of
2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, higher operating expense, interest income, other income and no income tax benefit in
the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 

Plan of Operation, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

During the first nine months of
2024, the Company s cash increased to 10,940,900 at September 30, 2024 from 2,269,200 at December 31, 2023.
During the first nine months of 2024, the Company generated 696,000 from its operating activities and provided 7,975,700 from investing
activities. 

During
the first nine months of 2024, the Company s revenues decreased approximately 16 primarily as a result of lower sales of ink
to an authorized printer of the Company s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and lower royalty revenues
from the Company s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. Our total overhead expenses increased in the first
nine months of 2024 to 3,560,500 compared to 1,596,800 in the first nine months of 2023, the Company s interest and other
income increased and the Company s income tax expense decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine
months of 2023. As a result of these factors, the Company generated a net loss of 2,284,700 in the first nine months of 2024
compared to a net loss of 343,900 in the first nine months of 2023. The Company had positive operating cash flow of 696,000 and
 7,985,600 from the sale of short-term investments during the first nine months of 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had
positive working capital of 8,784,500 and stockholders equity of 10,185,500. For the full year of 2023, the Company had a
net loss of 1,435,900 and had negative operating cash flow of 19,300. At December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of
 10,618,500 and stockholders equity of 12,382,500. 

14 

Our plan of operation for the
twelve months beginning with the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q consists of concentrating available human and financial resources
to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships the Company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market.
This includes two licensees that have been marketing products incorporating the Company s technologies since 2012. These two licensees
maintain a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market and are well known and highly regarded participants in this
market. We anticipate that these two licensees will expand their current offerings that incorporate our technologies and will introduce
and market new products that will incorporate our technologies available to them under their license agreements with the Company. We will
continue to develop various applications for these licensees. We also plan to expand our licensee base in the entertainment and toy market.
We currently have additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating our technologies in certain geographic and niche
markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market. 

The Company maintains its presence
in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market can be achieved through increased security ink sales
to its licensees in this market. We will continue to adjust our production and technical staff as necessary and, subject to available
financial resources, invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond our current
capacity. Additionally, we will pursue opportunities to market our current technologies in specific security and non-security markets.
There can be no assurances that these efforts will enable the Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow. 

Our
future growth strategy includes expanding our business through acquisitions of other companies with competing or complementary services,
technologies or businesses in order to expand our product and service offerings to grow our free cash flow. We are currently
actively engaged in the process to identify acquisition candidates and negotiate transactions. As of the date of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, we have no agreements to make any acquisition. We expect to fund our business expansion through the issuance of debt
or equity securities, the payment of cash, the exchange of services, or any combination thereof. 

 The Company has received, and
may in the future seek, additional capital in the form of debt, equity or both, to support our working capital requirements and
to provide funding for other business opportunities. We cannot assure you that if we require additional capital, that we will be successful
in obtaining such additional capital, or that such additional capital, if obtained, will enable the Company to generate additional revenues
and positive cash flow. 

As previously stated, we generate
a significant portion of our total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. These licensees generally sell
their products through retail outlets. In the future, such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur
as a result of an uncertain economic environment in 2024 and beyond and its effect on the global economy, geopolitical instability including
the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East and the supply chain disruptions related to both as well as the record inflation
and significantly higher interest rates currently being experienced in the United States along with the probability of an economic recession
both in the United States and globally. As a result, our revenues, results of operations and liquidity may be further negatively impacted
in future periods.

and Procedures. The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal

to the Company s management, including the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
