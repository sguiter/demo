INTRODUCTORY NOTE 
 
 On October 20, 2021 (the "Closing" or the Closing Date ), Mirion Technologies, Inc. (formerly known as GS Acquisition Holdings Corp II or "GSAH") consummated its business combination with GSAH (the "Business Combination") pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement dated June 17, 2021 (as amended, the Business Combination Agreement ). On the Closing Date, GSAH was renamed Mirion Technologies, Inc. 
 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to Mirion, the Company, we, us or our refer to Mirion Technologies, Inc. following the Business Combination, other than certain historical information which refers to the business of Mirion Technologies (TopCo), Ltd. Mirion TopCo prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. 
 
 As a result of the Business Combination, Mirion s financial statement presentation distinguishes Mirion TopCo as the Predecessor for periods prior to the closing of the Business Combination and Mirion Technologies, Inc. as the Successor for periods after the closing of the Business Combination. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting in the Successor Period, the financial statements for the Successor Period are presented on a full step-up basis as a result of the Business Combination, and are therefore not comparable to the financial statements of the Predecessor Period that are not presented on the same full step-up basis due to the Business Combination. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe-harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that reflect future plans, estimates, beliefs, and expected performance. All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, our objectives for future operations, macroeconomic trends, macro trends in nuclear power and cancer care, and our competitive positioning are forward-looking statements. This includes, without limitation, statements under Part I, Item 2.

The Medical segment provides radiation oncology quality assurance, delivering patient safety solutions for diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy centers around the world, dosimetry solutions for monitoring the total amount of radiation medical staff members are exposed to over time, radiation therapy quality assurance solutions for calibrating and verifying imaging and treatment accuracy, and radionuclide therapy products for nuclear medicine applications such as shielding, product handling, and medical imaging furniture. The Technologies segment provides robust, field ready personal radiation detection and identification equipment for defense applications and radiation detection and analysis tools for power plants, labs, and research applications. Nuclear power plant product offerings are used for the full nuclear power plant lifecycle including core detectors and essential measurement devices for new build, maintenance, decontamination and decommission equipment for monitoring and control during fuel dismantling and remote environmental monitoring.

operating and reportable segments: Medical and Technologies. These segments align the Company s products and service offerings with customer use in medical and industrial markets and are consistent with how the Company s Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM ), reviews and evaluates the Company s operations. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the financial performance of each operating segment. The Company s segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately because each one develops, manufactures and markets distinct products and services. Refer to Note 15, Segment Information , for further detail.

Significant Accounting Policies 
 There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023. 
 The allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Prepaid vendor deposits Prepaid software expenses Short-term marketable securities Income tax receivable and prepaid income taxes Other tax receivables Other current assets 
 million for both periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and were included in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accretion expense related to these liabilities was not material for any periods presented.

 was approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company expects to recognize approximately , , , and of the remaining performance obligations as revenue during 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively, and the remainder thereafter. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, a contract in our Technologies segment was modified such that a portion of the future consideration in the contract became contingent on future actions under the control of the customer. As a result, the remaining performance obligation of million was removed from our total remaining performance obligations. The impact of this modification was immaterial to our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Disaggregation of Revenues 
 A disaggregation of the Company s revenues by segment, geographic region, timing of revenue recognition and product category is provided in Note 15, Segment Information . 
 shares of Class A common stock. Th e Company accounts for the warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , under which the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as derivative liabilities. Accordingly, the Company classifies the warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjusts the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company s unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the warrants (the "Public Warrants") issued in connection with GSAH's initial public offering has been measured based on the listed market price of such Public Warrants. As the transfer of certain warrants issued in a private placement (the "Private Placement Warrants" and, together with the Public Warrants, the "Warrants") to GS Sponsor II LLC, the sponsor of GSAH (the "Sponsor"), to anyone who is not a permitted transferee would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants, we determined that the fair value of each Private Placement Warrant is equivalent to that of each Public Warrant. The determination of the fair value of the warrant liability may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly. Derivative warrant liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities.

The number of shares provided to the warrant holder was determined in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement, whereby the number of shares received in a cashless exercise was based upon the Redemption Date and the average last reported sale price of Class A common stock for the trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the notice of Redemption Date. The Public Warrants were valued using the listed trading price as of close on the trading day prior to the relevant settlement date of exercise. Any Warrants not exercised by the Redemption Date were automatically redeemed by the Company at a price of per Warrant. In connection with the Redemption, approximately Public Warrants were exercised, representing approximately of the outstanding Public Warrants, and shares of Class A common stock were issued upon exercise of such Warrants. Total cash proceeds generated from exercises of the Public Warrants were immaterial, and the Company made an immaterial redemption payment to the holders of the redeemed Public Warrants. Following the Redemption Date, the Public Warrants stopped trading on NYSE and were delisted. Public Warrants were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 On June 4, 2024, the Company exchanged shares of the Company's Class A common stock for Private Placement Warrants via a warrant exchange agreement. The number of shares of Class A common stock to be exchanged on a cashless basis was determined using the same methodology applied to the Public Warrants. The Company valued the Private Placement Warrants on the settlement date of exercise, using the fair market value of the Company's Class A common stock as of close on a trading day prior to the settlement date multiplied by the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued per Warrant, which was determined in accordance with the terms of the warrant exchange agreement. Private Placement Warrants were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a million loss resulting from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities through the date of exercise or redemption within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, the fair value of the warrant liabilities of million was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no customer accounted for more than 10 of the accounts receivable balance.

 million in a taxable transaction pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated November 1, 2023 between Mirion and ec 2 . As part of the Mirion Medical segment, ec 2 will complement the Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging portfolio of Capintec. The total business enterprise value acquired for the ec 2 acquisition was comprised of million of intangible assets related to technology, trade name, and customer list, million of goodwill and million of liabilities mainly related to deferred revenue. 
 
 Measurement period adjustments to the previously disclosed preliminary fair value of net assets related to ec 2 were recorded in 2024, resulting in a million net increase in goodwill, primarily due to additional consideration of million (final net working capital adjustment) a million net increase in intangible assets and a million net increase in liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The estimated fair values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition are provisional and may be revised as a result of additional information obtained during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, including but not limited to, deferred revenue balances and the valuation of tax accounts. 
 
 Transaction costs related to ec 2 were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 All acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, and the related assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. The Company makes an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based upon its understanding of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The Company obtains the information used for the purchase price allocation during due diligence and through other sources. In the months after closing, as the Company obtains additional information about the acquired assets and liabilities, including through tangible and intangible asset appraisals, and learns more about the newly acquired business, it is able to refine the estimates of fair value and more accurately allocate the purchase price. The fair values of acquired intangibles are determined based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the Company. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), and growth rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Only facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are considered for subsequent adjustment. The Company will make appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to completion of the measurement period, as required. 
 
 Purchases of acquired businesses resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, which is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The goodwill is not amortized but some portion may be deductible for income tax purposes. This goodwill recorded includes the following: 
 
 The expected synergies and other benefits that we believe will result from combining the operations of the acquired business with the operations of Mirion; 
 Any intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition, as well as future, yet unidentified projects and products; 
 The value of the existing business as an assembled collection of net assets versus if the Company had acquired all of the net assets separately. 
 
 Biodex Rehabilitation Sale to Salona Global 
 
 In the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, the Biodex Rehabilitation ("Rehab") business was deemed as held for sale. On April 3, 2023, the Company closed the sale of Rehab to Salona Global Medical Device Corporation ("Salona") for million in cash at closing and an additional million in deferred cash payments through January 1, 2024. Subsequent to the closing and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a significant negative event occurred which impacted the Company's ability to collect the remaining million of cash payments. Salona disclosed substantial doubt existed as to its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company applied ASC 450 Contingencies to determine the loss on the business disposal since remaining payments are contingent upon Salona's financial situation. Management determined it was not probable that the million of cash payments would be collected and recorded a loss on sale of business of million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 million senior secured first lien term loan facility and a million senior secured revolving facility (collectively, the Credit Facilities ). Funds from the Credit Facilities are permitted to be used in connection with the Business Combination and related transactions to refinance the 2019 Credit Facility referred to above and for general corporate purposes. The term loan facility is scheduled to mature on October 20, 2028 and the revolving facility is scheduled to expire and mature on October 20, 2026. The agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee of per annum for unused revolving commitments, subject to stepdowns to per annum and per annum upon the achievement of specified leverage ratios. Any outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2021 Credit Agreement reduce the availability under the revolving line of credit. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on the equity interests of the Parent Borrower owned by Holdings and substantially all of the assets (subject to customary exceptions) of the borrowers and the other guarantors thereunder. Interest with respect to the facilities is based on, at the option of the borrowers, (i) a customary base rate formula for borrowings in U.S. dollars or (ii) a floating rate formula based on LIBOR (with customary fallback provisions) for borrowings in U.S. dollars, a floating rate formula based on Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") for borrowings in Euro or a floating rate formula based on SONIA for borrowings in Pounds Sterling, each as described in the 2021 Credit Agreement with respect to the applicable type of borrowing. The 2021 Credit Agreement includes fallback language that seeks to either facilitate an agreement with the Company's lenders on a replacement rate for LIBOR in the event of its discontinuance or that automatically replaces LIBOR with benchmark rates based upon the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or other benchmark replacement rates upon certain triggering events. 
 On June 23, 2023, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to replace the interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate LIBOR and related LIBOR-based mechanics applicable to U.S. Dollar borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement with an interest rate based on SOFR and related SOFR-based mechanics. On December 30, 2023, certain subsidiaries of Mirion Technologies, Inc. and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, entered into a Holdings Assumption Agreement (the Holdings Assumption Agreement and related collateral and guarantee joinder documents that supplemented and modified the 2021 Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Holdings Assumption Agreement, Mirion Technologies (HoldingSub2), Ltd., a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales HoldingSub2 ), assigned to Mirion IntermediateCo, Inc., all of its rights, obligations and liabilities in and under the 2021 Credit Agreement, including its obligations to guarantee certain obligations of the borrowers under the 2021 Credit Agreement and to pledge certain assets. After giving effect to the Holdings Assumption Agreement, HoldingSub2 was released from all of its obligations and liabilities as Holdings under the Existing Credit Agreement and the other credit documents, and IntermediateCo became party as Holdings to the Existing Credit Agreement and the other credit documents to which HoldingSub2 was a party as Holdings for all purposes. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants include, among others and in each case subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, limitations on incurrence of liens, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness, limitations on making dividends and other distributions, limitations on engaging in asset sales, limitations on making investments, and a financial covenant that the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter is not greater than to 1.00 if on the last day of such fiscal quarter certain borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility exceed of the total revolving credit commitments at such time. The covenants also contain limitations on the activities of Mirion IntermediateCo, Inc. as the passive holding company. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured or waived, any unpaid amounts under the 2021 Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable, the revolving credit commitments may be terminated and remedies against the collateral may be exercised. Mirion IntermediateCo, Inc. was in compliance with all debt covenants on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for whole share of Class A common stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events. The Private Placement Warrants are non-redeemable and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. 
 
 The Private Placement Warrants are accounted for as liabilities as they contain terms and features that do not qualify for equity classification under ASC 815. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the private placement warrants were exchanged for the Company's Class A common stock; no liabilities remained at September 30, 2024.

Counterparty Credit Risk 
 Outstanding financial derivative instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the derivative agreements. The Company's credit exposure related to these financial instruments is represented by the notional amount of the hedging instruments. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. The Company's derivative instruments are with financial institutions of investment grade or better. Counterparty credit risk will be monitored through periodic review of counterparty bank s credit ratings and public financial filings. Based on these factors, the Company considers the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. 
 
 Cash Flow Hedging Strategy 
 The Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL and are reclassified into the line item in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in the fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCL into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is . 
 
 The interest rate swap was entered into by the Company during the second quarter of 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the interest rate swap resulted in losses of million and million, respectively, recognized in other comprehensive income ("OCI"). Gains of million and million, respectively, in income were recognized through interest expense and reclassified from OCI during the same period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the interest rate swap resulted in gains of million and million, respectively, recognized in OCI. Gains of million and million, respectively, in income were recognized through interest expense and reclassified from OCI during the same periods. The cash inflows and outflows associated with the Company s derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges are classified as financing activities in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In addition, the Company did not have any ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swap during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 18.) ) ) ) Weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted Net loss per common share attributable to Mirion Technologies, Inc. basic and diluted 
 Net loss per share of common stock is computed using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period has been distributed. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for the outstanding non-vested shares. Diluted loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method based on the nature of such securities. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company incurred a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; therefore, none of the potentially dilutive common shares were included in the diluted share calculations for those periods as they would have been anti-dilutive. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive common shares related to employee stock-based awards excluded as anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were million and million, respectively. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive common shares excluded as anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were million and million, respectively.

The holders of our Class A common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Holders of shares of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Company's Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the terms of any outstanding preferred stock. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up and after payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to creditors and to the holders of preferred stock having liquidation preferences, if any, the holders of shares of our Class A common stock will be entitled to receive pro rata our remaining assets available for distribution. Class A common stock issued and outstanding is included in the Company s basic loss per share calculation, with the exception of Founder Shares discussed below.

 Holders of shares of our Class B common stock are entitled to vote for each share held of record on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, including the election or removal of directors. If at any time the ratio at which shares of IntermediateCo Class B common stock are redeemable or exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock changes from -for-one as the number of votes to which our Class B common stockholders are entitled will be adjusted accordingly. The holders of our Class B common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Except for transfers to us or to certain permitted transferees set forth in the IntermediateCo certificate of incorporation, paired interests may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of. 
 
 Holders of shares of our Class B common stock are not entitled to economic interests in us or to receive dividends or to receive a distribution upon our liquidation or winding up, but are "paired interests" with shares of IntermediateCo Class B common stock. If IntermediateCo makes distributions to us other than solely with respect to our Class A common stock, the holders of paired interests will be entitled to receive distributions pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective shares of IntermediateCo Class B common stock. 
 
 Our Class B common stock has voting rights but no economic interest in the Company and therefore are excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. 
 
 Warrants 
 As described above, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding warrants to purchase up to shares of Class A common stock (including Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants). One whole warrant entitled the holder thereof to purchase share of Mirion Class A common stock at a price of per share. warrants were outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The Company s warrants are not included in the Company s calculation of basic loss per share and are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 
 
 Founder Shares 
 Founder shares are subject to certain vesting events and forfeit if a required vesting event does not occur within of the closing of the Business Combination. The founder shares are subject to vesting in equal tranches, based on the volume-weighted average price of our Class A common stock being greater than or equal to , and per share for any trading days in any consecutive trading day period. Holders of the founder shares are entitled to vote such founder shares and receive dividends and other distributions with respect to such founder shares prior to vesting, but such dividends and other distributions with respect to unvested founder shares will be set aside by the Company and shall only be paid to the holders of the founder shares upon the vesting of such founder shares. 
 
 As the holders of the founder shares are not entitled to participate in earnings unless the vesting conditions are met, the founders shares have been excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share. The founders shares are also excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of Mirion s financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes of Mirion Technologies, Inc. that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 that are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section entitled Risk Factors included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this section to we, us, our, Mirion and the Company refer to the business and operations of Mirion Technologies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts in this section are in millions. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a global provider of products, services, and software that allow our customers to safely leverage the power of ionizing radiation for the greater good of humanity through critical applications in the medical, nuclear and defense markets, as well as laboratories, scientific research, analysis, and exploration. 
 We provide dosimetry solutions for monitoring the total amount of radiation medical staff members are exposed to over time, radiation therapy quality assurance solutions for calibrating and verifying imaging and treatment accuracy, and radionuclide therapy products for nuclear medicine applications such as shielding, product handling, and medical imaging furniture. We provide robust, field-ready personal radiation detection and identification equipment for defense applications and radiation detection and analysis tools for power plants, labs, and research applications. Nuclear power plant product offerings are used for the full nuclear power plant lifecycle including core detectors, essential measurement devices for new build, maintenance, decontamination and decommission, and equipment for monitoring and control during fuel dismantling and remote environmental monitoring. 
 We manage and report results of operations in two business segments: Medical and Technologies. 
 Our revenues were 206.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 191.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, of which 35.8 and 36.0 were generated in the Medical segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 64.2 and 64.0 were generated in the Technologies segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Our revenues were 606.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 570.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which 35.3 and 35.6 were generated in the Medical segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 64.7 and 64.4 were generated in the Technologies segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Backlog (representing committed but undelivered contracts and purchase orders) was 814.9 million and 857.1 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. There was no impact to backlog as of September 30, 2024 from the long-term strategic partnership agreement signed with customer EDF during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, a contract in our Technologies segment was modified in which a portion of the future consideration in the contract became contingent on future actions under the control of the customer. As a result, the backlog of 21 million was removed. The impact of this modification was immaterial to our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 We believe that our business and results of operations and financial condition may be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following: 
 International conflict such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and conflict in the Middle East International conflict such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict has impacted and may continue to impact us, and conflict in the Middle East may impact us in the future, including through increased inflation, limited availability of certain commodities, supply chain disruption, disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including cyberattacks, 
 
 39 

Table of Content s 

 increased terrorist activities, volatility or disruption in the capital markets, and delays or cancellations of customer projects. 
 Inflation and interest rates We continue to actively monitor, evaluate and respond to developments relating to operational challenges in the current inflationary environment. Global supply chain disruptions and the higher inflationary environment remain unpredictable and our past results may not be indicative of future performance. In addition, the increase in interest rates has in turn led to increases in the interest rates applicable to our indebtedness and increased our debt service costs. 
 Tariffs or sanctions The United States imposes tariffs on imports from China and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs and restrictions implemented by China and other countries. There are, at any given time, a multitude of ongoing or threatened armed conflicts around the world. As one example, sanctions by the United States, the European Union, and other countries against Russian entities or individuals related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, along with any Russian retaliatory measures could increase our costs, adversely affect our operations, or impact our ability to meet existing contractual obligations. 
 Medical end market trends Growth and operating results in our Medical segment are impacted by: 
 Changes to global regulatory standards, including new or expanded standards; 
 Increased focus on healthcare safety; 
 Changes to healthcare reimbursement; 
 Potential budget constraints in hospitals and other healthcare providers; 
 Medical/lab dosimetry growth supported by growing and aging demographics, increased number of healthcare professionals, and penetration of radiation therapy/diagnostics; and 
 Medical radiation therapy quality assurance RT QA growth driven by growing and aging population demographics, low penetration of RT QA technology in emerging markets, and increased adoption of advanced software and hardware solutions for improved outcomes and administrative and labor efficiencies. 
 Strategic transactions A large driver of our historical growth has been the acquisition and integration of related businesses. Our ability to integrate, restructure, and leverage synergies of these businesses will impact our operating results over time. From time to time we also divest businesses, which could also impact our operating results. 
 Environmental objectives of governments Growth and operating results in our Technologies segment are impacted by environmental policy decisions made by governments in the countries where we operate. Our nuclear power customers may benefit from decarbonization efforts given the relatively low carbon footprint of nuclear power to other existing energy sources. In addition, decisions by governments to build new power plants or decommission existing plants can positively and negatively impact our customer base. 
 Government budgets While we believe that we are poised for growth from governmental customers in both of our segments, our revenues and cash flows from government customers are influenced, particularly in the short-term, by budgetary cycles. This impact can be either positive or negative. 
 Nuclear new build projects A portion of our backlog is driven by contracts associated with the construction of new nuclear power plants. These contracts can be long-term in nature and provide us with a strong pipeline for the recognition of future revenues in our Technologies segment. We perform our services and provide our products at a fixed price for certain contracts. Fixed-price contracts carry inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs, operational difficulties and other changes that may occur over the contract period. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate or if we do not execute the contract within our cost estimates, we may incur losses or the contract may not be as profitable as we expected. In addition, even though some of our longer-term contracts contain price escalation provisions, such provisions may not fully provide for cost increases, whether from inflation, the cost of goods and services to be delivered under such contracts or otherwise. 
 Research and development A portion of our operating expenses is associated with research and development activities associated with the design of new products. Given the specific design and application of certain of these products, there is some risk that these costs will not result in successful products in the market. Further, the timing of these products can move and be challenging to predict. 
 Financial risks Our business and financial statements can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our tax rates (including as a result of changes in tax laws) or income tax liabilities/assessments, changes in interest rates, and fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities. 
 Global risk Our business depends in part on operations and sales outside the United States. Risks related to those international operations and sales include new foreign investment laws, new export/import regulations, and additional trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes). New laws that favor local competitors could prevent our ability to compete outside the United States. Additional potential issues are associated with the impact

 of these same risks on our suppliers and customers. If our customers or suppliers are impacted by these risk factors, we may see the reduction or cancellation of customer orders, or interruptions in raw materials and components. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. GAAP ). However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and other users with additional meaningful information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, and planning decisions, and in evaluating our performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 
 In particular, we use the non-GAAP financial measures EBITA, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA." "Adjusted EBITDA" is used in the calculation of the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio in the 2021 Credit Agreement described in Note 8, Borrowings , to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Recent Developments 
 Russia and Ukraine 
 The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other governments have implemented major trade and financial sanctions against Russia and related parties in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We do business with

Table of Content s 

 Russian customers both within and outside of Russia and with customers who have contracts with Russian counterparties. The conflict s impact on the Company is predominantly in our Technologies segment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has approximately 6.1 million in net contract assets and accounts receivable, net of related reserves of approximately 1.1 million for Russian customers and channel partners. The Company maintains 14.4 million in advance payment guarantees and 14.5 million in performance guarantees in support of these projects. As of September 30, 2024, we continue to experience delays in recognizing project revenue due to the trade and financial sanctions made to date. The remaining performance obligations in our backlog for Russian-related projects was approximately 117.2 million at September 30, 2024. 
 In April 2023, one of our Russian customers made a claim against the Company, including liquidated damages for certain delays under the terms of an active project, in the amount of 19.3 million, and sent an updated claim statement in October 2023 totaling 21 million 18 million of which accrue daily penalties), subject to a 14 million contractual cap (all amounts converted from Euros to U.S. Dollars). No legal actions have been taken to date by the customer on this matter, and management disputes these claims, believes that the Company has substantial defenses and expects to vigorously defend against these claims. However, uncertainty exists as to the resolution, including any impact from potential modifications of the underlying active contract. 
 I n June 2023, the same Russian customer made a demand against the Company for the return of all payments received by the Company 10.2 million) related to a Finland nuclear power plant project cancelled in May 2022. In September 2024, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the customer agreeing to refund 4.8 million. The amount is included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the u naudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, and the settlement resulted in an immaterial impact to the unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company will continue to monitor the social, political, regulatory and economic environment in Ukraine and Russia, and will consider actions as appropriate. 
 Interest Rates 
 Global interest rates remained elevated during the first half of 2024 after the series of interest rate hikes that have occurred since late 2022, with a slight drop in Q3 2024. The Company's 2021 Credit Agreement provides for an 830.0 million senior secured first lien term loan facility (maturing in October 2028) and a 90.0 million senior secured revolving facility (expiring and maturing in October 2026) (collectively, the Credit Facilities ). 
 In response to the current interest rate environment, the Company refinanced the Credit Facilities on May 22, 2024 and reduced the term loan facility applicable margin rate to the greater of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or 0.50 , plus 2.25 (was 2.75 previous to the refinancing) and reduced the credit spread based upon rate term to 0 . There were no other change to the terms of the Credit Facilities as a result of the refinancing. The change was accounted for prospectively as a debt modification in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments. 
 The interest rate for the term loan was 6.85 (with no spread rate based upon rate term) and 8.25 (including spread based upon rate term) as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Biodex Rehab Sale 
 On April 3, 2023, the Company closed the sale of the Biodex Rehabilitation ("Rehab") business to Salona Global Medical Device Corporation ("Salona"). As a result, Rehab operating results are included in Mirion's operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2023. 
 Subsequent to the closing and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, significant events occurred that negatively impacted the Company's ability to collect the remaining 7.0 million of cash payments owned for the sale, including disclosure by Salona that substantial doubt existed as to its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company elected to apply ASC 450 Contingencies to determine the loss on the business disposal since remaining payments were contingent on Salona's financial situation. As a result a loss on sale of business of 6.5 million was recorded in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Salona paid 1.2 million of the amount owed for the sale, and accordingly the Company recorded the payment as a reversal of the contingent loss in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Doubt still exists regarding Salona's ability to pay the remaining amounts owed, and the Company will continue to monitor the situation.

 ec 2 Software Solutions LLC and NUMA LLC Acquisition 
 On November 1, 2023, the Company acquired ec 2 Software Solutions LLC and NUMA LLC (collectively ec 2 for 33 million of cash consideration. Headquartered in Somerset, NJ, ec 2 is a medical software company that designs, implements, and supports comprehensive software solutions servicing the nuclear medicine industry. The ec 2 team and portfolio of solutions were integrated as part of the Company's Medical segment. As a result, ec 2 operating results are included in Mirion's operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 but not included for the same periods ended September 30, 2023. 
 Public and Private Warrants Redemptions 
 On April 18, 2024, the Company announced that it would redeem all Public Warrants that remained outstanding at 5:00 pm New York City time on Monday, May 20, 2024 (the "Redemption Date"). Holders had the option to exercise their warrants and receive the Company's Class A common stock (i) in exchange for a payment in cash of the 11.50 per warrant exercise price, or (ii) on a cashless basis in which the exercising holder received a number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock determined under the warrant agreement based on the redemption date and the redemption fair market value. The fair market value was based on the average last price per share of the Company's Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Notice of Redemption was sent. Substantially all holders elected a cashless exercise in their redemption elections. In addition, on June 4, 2024, the Company entered into a warrant exchange agreement with GS Sponsor II LLC to issue an aggregate of 1,768,000 shares of the Company s Class A common stock upon the exchange of 8,500,000 Private Placement Warrants. 
 
 As a result of the change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities through the Redemption Date, the Company recorded a 0.4 million gain in the change in fair value of these warrant liabilities within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations, and then reclassified the resulting warrant liability of 60.6 million to additional paid-in capital upon completion of the exercises and redemptions during the three months ended June 30, 2024. No warrants remain outstanding as of June 30, 2024. 
 
 Facility Closure 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management announced that it would close its Middleton, Wisconsin office and move operations to our Virginia facility within the Medical segment in an effort to simplify product lines and cease the production of the lasers product line. As a result of the announcement, the Company recorded 3.2 million of losses for the impairment of the facility's right-of-use asset and related leasehold improvements and write-off of inventories (included as part of our restructuring charges, see Note 19, Restructuring and Related Impairments , to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). The closure is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2024.

 Results of Operations 
 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented below (in millions): 
 Unaudited Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues 206.8 191.2 Cost of revenues 113.9 110.4 Gross profit 92.9 80.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 84.3 83.7 Research and development 10.2 7.9 Loss on disposal of business 0.3 Loss from operations (1.6) (11.1) Interest expense, net 12.7 14.2 Foreign currency (gain) loss, net (0.9) 1.5 (Decrease) increase in fair value of warrant liabilities (12.8) Other expense (income), net (0.4) (0.3) Loss before income taxes (13.0) (13.7) Loss (benefit) from income taxes 1.0 (0.8) Net loss (14.0) (12.9) Loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.4) (0.8) Net loss attributable to stockholders (13.6) (12.1) 
 Overview 
 Revenues were 206.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 191.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our Medical segment contributed 74.1 million and 68.8 million of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Technologies segment contributed 132.7 million and 122.4 million of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross profit was 92.9 million and 80.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in an 12.1 million increase from the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net loss was 14.0 million and 12.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Medical segment contributed 4.0 million of income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Technologies segment contributed 14.7 million of income from operations and 5.4 million of income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The overall increase in net loss is primarily driven by a 12.8 million decrease in the loss from fair value of warrant liabilities in the prior year that no longer impacts the current year, higher provision for/lower benefit from income taxes in the current year, increased restructuring costs, and increased compensation costs in the current year. Offsetting these items were increased revenues in the Medical and Technologies segments, a favorable margin for current projects and products in the current period, decreased amortization expense in the current year due to fully amortized intangibles, and lower selling, general and administrative costs associated with stock-based compensation expense. 
 Revenues 
 Revenues were 206.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 191.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues increased 15.6 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Medical segment revenues increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to price increases, organic volume growth, and the current year impact of the ec 2 acquisition. Partially offsetting the increases in Medical segment revenues period over period was reduced revenues from China orders compared to the prior year. 
 
 46 

Table of Content s 

 Technologies segment revenues increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to price increases and organic volume growth, partially offset by execution timing. 
 Cost of revenues 
 Cost of revenues was 113.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 110.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues increased 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of revenues related to the Medical segment increased 4.3 million period over period due to the impact of organic volume growth, increased costs from the ec 2 acquisition, the impact of the inventory provision taken due to the closure of its Middleton site, and inflation. The increase was partly offset by a decrease in cost of revenues due to lower China orders and a favorable margin due to product mix over the same period. 
 Cost of revenues related to the Technologies segment decreased 0.8 million period over period. The decrease was primarily driven by a positive product mix from higher margin projects and products, project timing, and other cost saving initiatives in the current year. Partially offsetting the decrease was organic volume growth and inflation in the current year. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses were 84.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 83.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in an increase of 0.6 million period over period. 
 Our Medical segment incurred higher SG A expenses of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to inflation, higher SG A expenses associated with restructuring in the current year, and the ec 2 acquisition. 
 Our Technologies segment incurred higher SG A expenses of 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher SG A expenses associated with increased compensation costs due to inflation and higher headcount, partially offset by decreased amortization expense resulting from fully amortized intangible assets. 
 Corporate SG A expenses were 18.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 18.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in SG A expenses of 0.4 million was primarily driven by a net decrease in stock-based compensation expense under the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan and Profit Interests (see Note 13, Stock-Based Compensation, to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Partially offsetting the decrease is an increase in compensation costs and external fees incurred for operational improvement initiatives. 
 
 Research and development 
 Research and development R D expenses were 10.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in an increase of 2.3 million period over period. The increase in R D expense was primarily due to increased compensation costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on disposal of business 
 Loss on disposal of business was 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, related to the sale of the Rehab business. See discussion in " Recent Developments Biodex Rehab Sale" for further details.

 Loss from operations 
 Loss from operations was 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with a loss of 11.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. On a segment basis, income from operations in the Medical segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 4.0 million and 4.0 million, respectively, representing consistent operations period over period. Income from operations in the Technologies segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and three months ended September 30, 2023 was 14.7 million and 5.4 million, respectively, representing an increase of 9.3 million period over period. Corporate expenses were 20.3 million and 20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease in income from operations of 0.2 million as discussed in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" above. See Business segments and Corporate and other below for further details. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net, was 12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest expense was due lower interest rates negotiated with the debt refinancing during the three months ended June 30, 2024, interest from derivatives, and additional interest earned on cash deposits in the current period. For more information, see Note 8, Borrowing s, and Note 17, Derivatives and Hedging , to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Foreign currency (gain) loss, net 
 We recorded a 0.9 million net gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a 1.5 million net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from foreign currency exchange. The change in net foreign currency loss (gain) is due primarily to fluctuations in European local currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 
 We recognized an unrealized gain of (12.8) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we settled the Public Warrant and Private Placement Warrant liabilities in conjunction with the warrant redemption/exchange. See Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 16, Fair Value Measurements , to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Income taxes 
 The effective income tax rate was (7.7) and 5.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The difference in effective tax rate between the periods was primarily attributable to mix of earnings and the impact of valuation allowances. 
 The effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 due primarily to U.S. federal permanent differences and the impact of valuation allowances. 
 Business segments 
 The following provides detail for business segment results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Segment (loss) income from operations includes revenues of the segment less expenses that are directly related to those revenues but excludes certain charges to cost of revenues and SG A expenses predominantly related to corporate costs, which are included in Corporate and Other in the table below. Interest expense, loss on debt extinguishment, foreign currency loss (gain), net, and other expense (income), net, are not allocated to segments.

 Medical segment revenues were 74.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 68.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 5.3 million increase period over period. Revenues increased 5.2 million due to price increases and organic growth and 3.0 million due to the acquisition of the ec 2 business. Offsetting the increase in the Medical segment revenues period over period was 2.2 million reduced revenues from Asia orders. 
 Income from operations was 4.0 million and 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing no increase in income from operations period over period. The consistent income from operations period over period was largely due to a favorable margin product mix of 0.6 million, and the increased revenues noted above including the increase in income from the acquisition of the ec 2 business of 0.3 million. Partially offsetting the increase in income was an increase of restructuring and impairment costs by 1.8 million in the current year, with the remainder primarily due to the negative impacts of inflation.

 Technologies segment revenues were 132.7 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 122.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 10.3 million period over period. The increase is primarily driven by increased revenue of 11.7 million due to price increases and organic growth, partially offset by a 2.2 million decrease due to projects execution timing. 
 Income from operations was 14.7 million and 5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income from operations increased 9.3 million period over period driven primarily by the changes in revenues described above, 7.2 million higher net income due to a positive product mix from higher margin projects and products in the current year, and 2.1 million in lower amortization expenses due to fully amortized intangible assets. Partially offsetting the increase in income from operations were increased SG A expenses of 2.8 million due to increased compensation costs and legal fees with the remainder primarily due to the negative impacts of inflation. 
 Corporate and other 
 Corporate and other costs include costs associated with our corporate headquarters located in Georgia, as well as centralized global functions including Executive, Finance, Legal and Compliance, Human Resources, Technology, Strategy, and Marketing and other costs related to company-wide initiatives (e.g., Business Combination transaction expenses, merger and acquisition activities, restructuring and other initiatives).

Table of Content s 

 Corporate and other costs were 20.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represents a decrease of 0.2 million period over period. The decrease versus the comparable period was predominantly driven by a net decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 2.3 million under the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan and Profit Interests (see Note 13, Stock-Based Compensation, to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Partially offsetting the decrease was an increase of 0.7 million in compensation costs, a 0.3 million increase in IT related costs, and a 0.9 million increase in external fees incurred for operational improvement initiatives in the current year.

 Overview 
 Revenues were 606.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 570.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our Medical segment contributed 214.1 million and 203.2 million of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Technologies segment contributed 392.4 million and 367.3 million of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross profit was 277.4 million and 247.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in an 29.5 million increase from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net loss was 52.5 million and 84.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Medical segment contributed 10.4 million of income from operations and 1.6 million of income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Technologies segment contributed 45.8 million of income from operations and 23.7 million of income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The overall decrease in net loss is primarily driven by increased revenues in the Medical and Technologies segments, a decrease in net interest expense in the current year, decreased amortization expense in the current year due to fully amortized intangibles, lower SG A costs associated with stock-based compensation expense, a decrease in loss on debt extinguishment in the current year, a current year gain on disposal of business, and a 1.0 million change in the loss from fair value of warrant liabilities. Partially offsetting these items was higher provision for/lower benefit from income taxes in the current year, increased restructuring and related impairment costs, and compensation costs in the current year.

 Revenues were 606.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 570.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues increased 36.0 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Medical segment revenues increased 10.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to price increases, organic volume growth, and the current year impact of the ec 2 acquisition. Partially offsetting the increases in Medical segment revenues period over period were a negative impact from delayed operations in the Nuclear Medicine business in February caused by the focus on a new ERP system implementation, reduced revenues from China and Russia orders compared to the prior year, and reduced revenues from the disposal of the Rehab business in the prior year. 
 Technologies segment revenues increased 25.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to price increases and organic volume growth, partially offset by projects execution timing. 
 Cost of revenues 
 Cost of revenues was 329.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 322.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues increased 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Cost of revenues related to the Medical segment increased 5.2 million period over period due to an increase in cost of revenues due to higher operations from organic growth over the same period, increased depreciation, increased costs from the ec 2 acquisition, and inflation, partially offset by a reduction of cost of revenues from the disposal of Rehab. 
 Cost of revenues related to the Technologies segment increased 1.4 million period over period. The increase was primarily driven by increased revenues over the same period and inflation, partially offset by a positive product mix from higher margin projects and products in the current year, and other cost saving initiatives. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 SG A expenses were 255.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 252.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in an increase of 3.1 million period over period. 
 Our Medical segment incurred higher SG A expenses of 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to inflation, bad debt expense, higher SG A associated with restructuring, and the impact from the ec 2 acquisition. Partially offsetting the increase were decreased depreciation expenses and the disposal of Rehab. 
 Our Technologies segment incurred higher SG A expenses of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher SG A expenses associated with increased compensation costs due to inflation and higher headcount, partially offset by decreased amortization expense resulting from fully amortized intangible assets and decreased bonus expenses in the current year. 
 Corporate SG A expenses were 55.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 57.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in SG A expenses of 2.1 million was driven by a net decrease in stock-based compensation expense under the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan and Profit Interests (see Note 13, Stock-Based Compensation, to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), partially offset by an increase in external fees incurred for operational improvement initiatives and compensation costs. 
 
 Research and development 
 R D expenses were 26.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 23.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in an increase of 3.0 million period over period. The increase in R D expense was primarily due to increased compensation costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 (Gain) loss on disposal of business 
 (Gain) loss on disposal of business were (1.2) million and 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the sale of the Rehab business. See discussion in " Recent Developments Biodex Rehab Sale" for further details. 
 Loss from operations 
 Loss from operations was 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 35.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On a segment basis, income from operations in the Medical segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 10.4 million and 1.6 million, respectively, representing an increase of 8.8 million period over period. Income from operations in the Technologies segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 45.8 million and 23.7 million, respectively, representing an increase of 22.1 million period over period. Corporate expenses were 60.4 million and 60.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 0.2 million period over period. See Business segments and Corporate and other below for further details. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net, was 39.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 42.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense was due to the 127.3 million early debt repayment using proceeds from the 150.0 million T. Rowe Price direct investment in 2023, lower interest rates negotiated with the debt refinancing during the three months ended June 30, 2024, interest from derivatives, and additional interest earned on cash deposits in the current year. For more information, see Note 8, Borrowing s, and Note 17, Derivatives and Hedging , to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Foreign currency loss, net 
 We recorded a 0.2 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a 1.0 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from foreign currency exchange. The change in net foreign currency loss is due primarily to fluctuations in European local currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 
 We recognized a loss of 5.3 million and 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a 1.0 million reduction in loss period over period. This change is due to a a settlement of the fair value mark-to-market of the Public Warrant and Private Placement Warrant liabilities in conjunction with the warrants redemptions/exchange during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 16, Fair Value Measurements , to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Income taxes 
 The effective income tax rate was (5.8) and 3.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The difference in effective tax rate between the periods was primarily attributable to mix of earnings and the impact of valuation allowances. 
 The effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 due primarily to U.S. federal permanent differences and the impact of valuation allowances. 
 Business segments 
 The following provides detail for business segment results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Segment (loss) income from operations includes revenues of the segment less expenses that are directly related to those revenues but excludes certain charges to cost of revenues and SG A expenses predominantly related to corporate costs, which are included in Corporate and Other in the table below. Interest expense, loss on debt extinguishment, foreign currency loss (gain), net, and other expense (income), net, are not allocated to segments.

 Medical 
 Unaudited (In millions) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues 214.1 203.2 Income from operations 10.4 1.6 Income from operations as a of revenues 4.9 0.8 
 
 Medical segment revenues were 214.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 203.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 10.9 million increase period over period. Revenues increased 9.4 million due to price increases and organic growth, and 10.0 million due to the acquisition of the ec 2 business. Partially offsetting the increase in the Medical segment revenues period over period were reduced revenues from the disposal of Rehab by 3.8 million, reduced revenues from China and Russia orders compared to the prior year by 3.7 million, and a negative impact from delayed operations due to the focus on a new ERP system implementation in the Nuclear Medicine business of approximately 1.6 million. 
 Income from operations was 10.4 million and 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase in income from operations of 8.8 million. The increase in income from operations period over period was largely due to a 7.6 million increase from organic volume growth and price increases, a favorable margin product mix of 2.1 million in the current year, and a net impact from the ec 2 business of 1.4 million. Partially offsetting the increase in income were the net decrease from the impact of China and Russia orders compared to the prior year, higher restructuring and related impairment costs of 4.1 million, a 1.0 million impact from delayed operations due to the focus on a new ERP system implementation in the Nuclear Medicine business, 1.5 million of additional bad debt in the current year, and the remainder primarily due to inflation. 
 Technologies 
 Unaudited (In millions) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues 392.4 367.3 Income from operations 45.8 23.7 Income from operations as a of revenues 11.7 6.5 
 Technologies segment revenues were 392.4 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 367.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 25.1 million period over period. The increase is primarily driven by increased revenue of 30.5 million due to price increases and organic growth, partially offset by a 5.8 million decrease due to project execution timing. 
 Income from operations was 45.8 million and 23.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income from operations increased 22.1 million period over period driven primarily by the changes in revenues described above, 6.3 million in lower amortization expenses due to fully amortized intangible assets, and 12.7 million of a positive product mix from higher margin projects and products in the current year. Partially offsetting the increases in income from operations were increased cost of revenues of 15.5 million due to higher volume, with the remainder primarily due to negative impacts of inflation. 
 Corporate and other 
 Corporate and other costs include costs associated with our corporate headquarters located in Georgia, as well as centralized global functions including Executive, Finance, Legal and Compliance, Human Resources, Technology, Strategy, and Marketing and other costs related to company-wide initiatives (e.g., Business Combination transaction expenses, merger and acquisition activities, restructuring and other initiatives).

Corporate and other costs were 60.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 60.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 0.2 million period over period. Period over period there was a net decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 6.6 million (see Note 13, Stock-Based Compensation, to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), partially offset by a 2.6 million increase in compensation costs and a 3.2 million increase in external fees incurred for operational improvement initiatives.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview of Liquidity 
 Our primary future cash needs relate to working capital, operating activities, capital spending, strategic investments, and debt service. 
 Mirion management believes that net cash provided by operating activities, augmented by long-term debt arrangements, will provide adequate liquidity for the next 12 months of independent operations, as well as the resources necessary to invest for growth in existing businesses and manage its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis. Access to capital and availability of financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including our credit rating, economic conditions, and the overall liquidity of capital markets. There can be no assurance of continued access to financing from the capital markets on acceptable terms or at all. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had 133.7 million and 128.8 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents, which include amounts held by entities outside of the United States of approximately 104.2 million and 105.4 million, respectively, primarily in Europe and Canada. Non-U.S. cash is generally available for repatriation without legal restrictions, subject to certain taxes, mainly withholding taxes. We are asserting indefinite reinvestment of cash for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company has alternative repatriation options other than dividends should the need arise. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for up to 90.0 million of revolving borrowings. The amount available on the revolver as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately 72.2 million and 73.3 million, respectively. 
 The Company uses fixed-to-fixed cross-currency rate swaps ("CCRS") to protect the net investment on pre-tax basis in the Company s EUR-denominated operations against changes in spot exchange rates. One of the CCRS matures and settles on December 31, 2024. The current fair value of this derivative financial instrument is 11.9 million and is classified as a current liability (see Note 17, Derivatives and Hedging , to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
 There is a discussion in Note 8, Borrowings , of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q of the long-term debt arrangements issued by Mirion. For more information on our lease commitments, see Note 9, Leased Assets , of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and for other commitments and contingencies, see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Debt Profile 
 2021 Credit Agreement 
 On the Closing Date, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a credit agreement (as it may be amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, the 2021 Credit Agreement with the lending institutions party thereto. The 2021 Credit Agreement refinanced and replaced an earlier credit facility (the "2019 Credit Facility"). 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for an 830.0 million senior secured first lien term loan facility and a 90.0 million senior secured revolving facility (collectively, the Credit Facilities ). Funds from the Credit Facilities are permitted to be used in connection with the Business Combination and related transactions, to refinance the 2019 Credit Facility referred to above and for general corporate purposes. The term loan facility is scheduled to mature on October 20, 2028 and the revolving facility is scheduled to expire and mature on October 20, 2026. The agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee of 0.50 per annum for unused revolving commitments, subject to stepdowns to 0.375 per annum and 
 
 54 

Table of Content s 

 0.25 per annum upon the achievement of specified leverage ratios. Any outstanding letters of credit issued under the 2021 Credit Agreement reduce the availability under the revolving line of credit. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on the equity interests of the Parent Borrower owned by Holdings and substantially all of the assets (subject to customary exceptions) of the borrowers and the other guarantors thereunder. Interest with respect to the facilities is based on, at the option of the borrowers, (i) a customary base rate formula for borrowings in U.S. dollars or (ii) a floating rate formula based on LIBOR (with customary fallback provisions described below) for borrowings in U.S. dollars, a floating rate formula based on EURIBOR for borrowings in Euro or a floating rate formula based on SONIA for borrowings in Pounds Sterling, each as described in the 2021 Credit Agreement with respect to the applicable type of borrowing. The 2021 Credit Agreement includes fallback language that seeks to either facilitate an agreement with our lenders on a replacement rate for LIBOR in the event of its discontinuance or that automatically replaces LIBOR with benchmark rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or other benchmark replacement rates upon triggering events. 
 On June 23, 2023, the 2021 Credit Agreement was amended to replace the interest rate based on the London interbank offered rate LIBOR and related LIBOR-based mechanics applicable to U.S. Dollar borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement with an interest rate based on SOFR and related SOFR-based mechanics. 
 On May 22, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No.3 Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment reduced the applicable margin rate on the term loans from 2.75 to 2.25 and reduced the credit spread based upon rate term to 0 , with other terms and conditions remaining consistent (effectively the existing loan was refinanced). The Amendment was accounted for prospectively as a debt modification in accordance with ASC 470-50, Debt Modifications and Extinguishments. No further principal payments are due until the expiration of the term. The interest rate was 6.85 (with no spread rate based upon rate term) and 8.40 (including spread rate based upon rate term) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants include, among others and in each case subject to certain thresholds and exceptions, limitations on incurrence of liens, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness, limitations on making dividends and other distributions, limitations on engaging in asset sales, limitations on making investments, and a financial covenant that the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter is not greater than 7.00 to 1.00 if on the last day of such fiscal quarter certain borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility exceed 40 of the total revolving credit commitments at such time. The covenants also contain limitations on the activities of Mirion IntermediateCo, Inc. as the passive holding company. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured or waived, any unpaid amounts under the 2021 Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable, the revolving credit commitments may be terminated and remedies against the collateral may be exercised. 
 Cash flows

 Unaudited (In millions) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 38.3 28.2 Net cash used in investing activities (34.1) (22.3) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (2.0) 22.0 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 38.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 28.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 10.1 million. The change is primarily due to a decrease in net loss and improved operating cash flows from the change in accounts receivable and accounts payable offset by decreased operating cash flows from deferred contract revenue.

Table of Content s 

 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 34.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus 22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 representing a change of 11.8 million. The increase in net cash used was driven primarily by an 11.9 million increase in purchases of property, plant, and equipment and badges. 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 2.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus cash provided of 22.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 24.0 million period over period primarily relates to the 150.0 million of gross proceeds received from the T. Rowe direct investment in the prior year partially offset by debt repayments of approximately 127.3 million in the prior year. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Such estimates are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. 
 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Due to the nature of our activities, we are at times subject to pending and threatened legal actions that arise out of the ordinary course of business. For information regarding legal proceedings and other claims in which we are involved, see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies , to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The disposition of any such currently pending or threatened matters is not expected to have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more legal actions. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on our business because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change and could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2023 annual report. There are no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed, nor have we identified any previously undisclosed risks that could materially adversely affect our business and financial results.
