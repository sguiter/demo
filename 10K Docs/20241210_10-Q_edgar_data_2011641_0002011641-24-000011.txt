The majority of the Company s revenue originates from sales arrangements with a single performance obligation to deliver products, whereby the performance obligations are satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer which is the point the product is delivered to, or collected by, the customer.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations MD A is intended to convey management s perspective regarding the Company s operational and financial performance for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This MD A should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report (the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Annual Report. 
 The following discussion contains trend information and other forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements, as well as from our historical performance, due to various factors, including, but not limited to, those referred to in Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Overview 
 Ferguson is a value-added distributor serving the specialized professional in the residential and non-residential North American construction market. We help make our customers complex projects simple, successful and sustainable by providing expertise and a wide range of products and services from plumbing, HVAC, appliances, and lighting to PVF, water and wastewater solutions, and more. 
 The following table presents highlights of the Company s performance for the periods below: 
 Three months ended October 31, (In millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 Net sales 7,772 7,708 Operating profit 665 739 Net income 470 519 Earnings per share - diluted 2.34 2.54 Net cash provided by operating activities 345 557 Supplemental non-GAAP financial measures: (1) 
 Adjusted operating profit 706 773 Adjusted earnings per share - diluted 2.45 2.65 
 
 (1) The Company uses certain non-GAAP measures, which are not defined or specified under U.S. GAAP. See the section titled Non-GAAP Reconciliations and Supplementary Information . 
 For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, net sales increased by 0.8 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher sales volume and incremental revenue from acquisitions, partially offset by price deflation (approximately 2 ), mainly within certain commodity categories. 
 For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, operating profit decreased by 10.0 (adjusted operating profit decreased 8.7 ), compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease was primarily due to higher operating costs driven by sales volume growth, as well as inflation. 
 For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, diluted earnings per share was 2.34 (adjusted diluted earnings per share: 2.45), decreasing 7.9 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (7.5 on an adjusted basis) due to lower net income, partially offset by the impact of share repurchases. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 0.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with 0.6 billion in the same period in fiscal 2024, primarily reflecting an increase in working capital period-over-period, along with lower net income after adjusting for non-cash items.

Results of Operations 
 Three months ended October 31, (In millions) 2024 2023 Net sales 7,772 7,708 Cost of sales (5,432) (5,377) Gross profit 2,340 2,331 Selling, general and administrative expenses (1,585) (1,512) Depreciation and amortization (90) (80) Operating profit 665 739 Interest expense, net (46) (45) Other income (expense), net 5 (3) Income before income taxes 624 691 Provision for income taxes (154) (172) Net income 470 519 
 Net sales 
 Net sales were 7.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 0.1 billion, or 0.8 , compared with the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales was driven by higher sales volume and incremental sales from acquisitions of 1.1 , partially offset by price deflation of approximately 2 , mainly within certain commodity categories. The Company s increase in net sales was primarily driven by its United States segment, mainly due to growth in non-residential sales. 
 For further discussion on the Company s net sales, see the Segment results section below. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 9 million, or 0.4 , compared with the same period in fiscal 2024, primarily reflecting increased net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.1 and 30.2 in the first quarters of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively.

Non-GAAP Reconciliations and Supplementary Information 
 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the Company believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the Company s financial information with additional meaningful information to assist in understanding financial results and assessing the Company s performance from period to period. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share adjusted EPS - diluted. Management believes these measures are important indicators of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses, and they are consistent with how business performance is planned, reported and assessed internally by management and the Company s Board of Directors. Such non-GAAP adjustments include amortization of acquired intangible assets, discrete tax items, and any other items that are non-recurring. Non-recurring items may include various restructuring charges, gains or losses on the disposals of businesses which by their nature do not reflect primary operations, as well as certain other items deemed non-recurring in nature and/or that are not a result of the Company s primary operations. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results reported under U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of operations that, when viewed with U.S. GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of the business. The Company strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review the Company s financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources
