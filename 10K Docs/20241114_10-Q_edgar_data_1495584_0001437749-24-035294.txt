of its assets for investment purposes in technology companies, which are considered to be those companies that derive at least of their revenues from products and/ or services within the information technology sector or the cleantech sector. Information technology companies include, but are not limited to, those focused on computer hardware, software, telecommunications, networking, Internet, and consumer electronics. While there is no standard definition of cleantech, it is generally regarded as including goods and services designed to harness renewable energy and materials, eliminate emissions and waste, and reduce the use of natural resources. In addition, under normal circumstances we will invest at least of our assets in privately held companies and in public companies with market capitalizations less than 250 million. Our portfolio is primarily composed of equity and equity derivative securities of technology and cleantech companies (as defined above). These investments generally range between million and million each, although the investment size will vary proportionately with the size of the Company s capital base. The Company s shares as of September 30. 2023 were listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol SVVC. Subsequent to September 30, on October 6, 2023, the Company notified NASDAQ of the fund s intention to voluntarily delist. As of the date these financial statements were issued the Company s shares are quoted on the OTCQB market under the symbol SVVC. Firsthand Capital Management, Inc., which was previously known as SiVest Group, Inc. FCM or the Advisor ), serves as the investment adviser to the Company. 
 
 The Company is an investment company and follows accounting and reporting guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946. 
 
 CONSOLIDATION OF SUBSIDIARIES. On May 8, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the formation of a fully owned and controlled subsidiary (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the Company named Firsthand Venture Investors FVI ), a California general partnership formed on March 30, 2015. After the close of business on June 30, 2015, the Company contributed substantially all of its assets to FVI in return for a controlling general partner ownership interest in FVI. The transaction was completed on July 1, 2015. Under this structure, we have all or substantially all of our investment activities conducted through our fully owned subsidiary, FVI. 
 
 During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, with the approval of its Board of Directors, the Company organized three separate fully owned and controlled subsidiaries (as defined by the 1940 Act). Each subsidiary was a Cayman Islands corporation and the financial statements of each subsidiary were reported on a consolidated basis with the Company. Each subsidiary was formed for the purpose of holding one or more investments made by the Company, and was treated as a controlled foreign corporation under the Internal Revenue Code not separately subject to U.S. federal income tax. FVI was treated as the sole U.S. shareholder of each subsidiary. 
 
 The Board of Directors of the Company approved the liquidation of those three Cayman subsidiaries on November 2, 2018. That liquidation was completed on December 27, 2018. 

million. The fair values of our venture capital investments were also determined by the Advisor as the valuation designee. Upon sale of these investments, the values that are ultimately realized may be different from what is presently estimated. The difference could be material.

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, the Board has approved a multi-step valuation process to be followed each quarter, as described below: 
 
 1 each quarter the valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the Advisor s Valuation Committee or the independent valuation firm; 

2 the Valuation Committee of the Board on a quarterly basis reviews the preliminary valuation of the Advisor s Valuation Committee and that of the independent valuation firms and makes the fair value determination, in good faith, based on the valuation recommendations of the Advisor s Valuation Committee and the independent valuation firms; and 

3 at each quarterly Board meeting, the Board considers the valuations recommended by the Advisor s Valuation Committee and the independent valuation firms that were previously submitted to the Valuation Committee of the Board and ratifies the fair value determinations made by the Valuation Committee of the Board. 

of our gross assets. For services rendered under the Investment Management Agreement, the base management fee will be payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee will be calculated based on the average of 1 the value of our gross assets at the end of the current calendar quarter and 2 the value of the Company s gross assets at the end of the preceding calendar quarter; and will be appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter will be pro-rated. 
 
 The incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing on April 15, 2011, and equals of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees, provided that the incentive fee determined as of December 31, 2022, will be calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any realized gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from inception. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were incentive fee adjustments. 
 
 Effective September 30, 2023, the Company has entered into a fee waiver agreement with FCM (the Fee Waiver Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Fee Waiver Agreement, FCM agrees to 1 waive future accruals of the base management fee starting October 1, 2023, through December 31, 2024, with future recoupment to the extent permitted by the Investment Management Agreement, and 2 waive million of base management fee that has been accrued but unpaid prior to but unpaid as of September 30, 2023. Any accrued base management fee waived under section 2 may be recouped by FCM within ten years. 
 
 Effective March 31, 2024, the Company has entered into a fee waiver agreement with FCM (the Fee Waiver Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Fee Waiver Agreement, FCM agrees to waive million of base management fee that has been accrued but unpaid prior to but unpaid as of March 31, 2024. Any accrued base management fee waived may be recouped by FCM within ten years. 

- Income Approach (I): The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present value amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. Those valuation techniques include present value techniques; option-pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes-Merton formula (a closed-form model) and a binomial model (a lattice model), which incorporate present value techniques; and the multi-period excess earnings method, which is used to measure the fair value of certain assets. 

- Asset-Based Approach (A): The asset-based approach examines the value of a company s assets net of its liabilities to derive a value for the equity holders. 

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. In accordance with the guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board on fair value measurements and disclosures under GAAP, the Company discloses the fair value of its investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure the fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to valuations based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to valuations based upon unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation (Level 3 measurements). 
 
 The guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows: 
 
 Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the date of measurement. 

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument in an inactive market, prices for similar instruments in an active or inactive market, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risks, yield curves, default rates, and similar data. 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, to the extent relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability based on the best information available. 

The availability of observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the security. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. 
 
 The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety, is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Company s net assets as of September 30, 2024: 

Total Common Stocks 
 Preferred Stocks

At the end of each calendar quarter, management evaluates the Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities for changes in liquidity, including but not limited to: whether a broker is willing to execute at the quoted price, the depth and consistency of prices from third party services, and the existence of contemporaneous, observable trades in the market. Additionally, management evaluates the Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis for changes in listings or delistings on national exchanges. 

Following is a reconciliation of Level 3 assets (at either the beginning or the ending of the period) for which significant unobservable inputs were used to determine fair value.

The table below represents quantitative disclosure about significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements at September 30, 2024: 

1 Weighted average is calculated by weighting the significant unobservable input by the relative fair value of each investment in the category 
 
 2 An increase in the input would result in an increase in the security s valuation; a decrease in the input would result in a decrease in the security s valuation. 
 
 3 An increase in the input would result in a decrease in the security s valuation; a decrease in the input would result in an increase in the security s valuation. 

1 Weighted average is calculated by weighting the significant unobservable input by the relative fair value of each investment in the category 

2 An increase in the input would result in an increase in the security s valuation; a decrease in the input would result in a decrease in the security s valuation. 

3 An increase in the input would result in a decrease in the security s valuation; a decrease in the input would result in an increase in the security s valuation. 

Changes in any of our unobservable inputs, individually, may change the fair value of certain of the Company s investments. 
 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it. 

In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. 

Gross unrealized depreciation 
 Net unrealized depreciation 
 Federal income tax cost, Investments 

The Company did not qualify as a regulated investment company pursuant to Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, therefore it is taxed as a corporation. As a corporation, the Company is obligated to pay federal and state income tax on taxable income. The Company s net deferred tax asset balance has a full valuation allowance based on management s estimate of future realization of such assets. The Company is currently using an estimated tax rate of for Federal and for state taxes. 
 
 The Company s income tax provision consists of the following as of December 31, 2023: 

State 
 Total deferred tax (expense)/benefit 

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Such temporary differences are principally: (i) taxes on unrealized gains/(losses), which are attributable to the temporary difference between fair market value and tax basis, and (ii) the net tax benefit of accumulated net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using effective tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years such temporary differences are realized or otherwise settled. 

Components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 are as follows: 

Capital loss carryforward 
 Net unrealized losses (gains) on investment securities 
 Total deferred tax assets, net 
 Valuation allowance 
 Net 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had an effective tax rate of and a statutory tax rate of with state income tax) with the difference being attributable to changes in the components of the deferred tax assets and the valuation allowance account. 
 
 The effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 

Statutory federal income tax rate 

The variance in the effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three -month period ended September 30, 2024, is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance account. At September 30, 2024, the Company has established a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. 
 
 To the extent the Company has a deferred tax asset or if a portion of the deferred tax liability is offset by a tax asset resulting from net operating losses, consideration is given to whether or not a valuation allowance is required against the deferred tax asset amount. A valuation allowance is required if, based on the evaluation criterion provided by Accounting Standard Codification ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740 ), it is more-likely-than- not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Among the factors considered in assessing the Company s valuation allowance are: the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of the statutory carryforward periods, and the associated risks that operating and capital loss carryforwards may expire unused. Based on the Company s assessment, it has determined that in the future it is more likely than not that the Company will not generate the necessary appropriate character of income within the carryforward periods to realize its deferred tax assets, and as such, has placed a full allowance on the deferred tax assets. 
 
 From time to time, and as new information becomes available, the Company will modify its forecasts, estimates or assumptions regarding its deferred tax liability or asset. 

Modifications of the Company s estimates or assumptions regarding its deferred tax liability and/or asset balances and any applicable valuation allowance, changes in generally accepted accounting principles or related guidance or interpretations thereof, limitations imposed on net operating losses (if any), and changes in applicable tax law could result in increases or decreases in the Company s NAV, which could be material. Such changes could have a material impact on the Company s NAV and results of operations with respect to the Company s shareholders in the period it is recorded, even though the shareholders at such time might not have held shares in the Company at the time the deferred tax asset or liability had been established. 
 
 The Company s policy is to classify interest and penalties associated with underpayment of federal and state income taxes, if any, as income tax expense on its Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any interest or penalties associated with the underpayment of any income taxes. 
 
 The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and California. The Company has reviewed all major jurisdictions and concluded that there is no significant impact on the Company s net assets and tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions expected to be taken on its tax returns. Furthermore, management of the Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next 12 months. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state of income tax purposes of , which may be carried forward indefinitely. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company had net capital loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes, which may be carried forward for years, as follows:

As of September 30, 2024, Mr. Landis served as interim CEO at IntraOp Medical Corp. and Wrightspeed, Inc. Serving as a director or officer of portfolio companies may cause conflicts of interest. The Advisor has adopted various procedures to ensure that the Company will not be unfavorably affected by these potential conflicts. 

Certain local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on a security or instrument. Since 2020, the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID- 19 has negatively affected the worldwide economy, as well as the economies of individual countries, the financial health of individual companies and the market in general in significant and unforeseen ways. Following Russia s large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order in February 2022 prohibiting U.S. persons from entering transactions with the Central Bank of Russia and Executive Orders in March 2022 prohibiting U.S. persons from importing oil and gas from Russia as well as other popular Russian exports, such as diamonds, seafood and vodka. The duration of the coronavirus outbreak and the Russian-Ukraine conflict could adversely affect the Company s performance. The ultimate impact of COVID- 19 and Russia invasion on the financial performance of the Company s investments is not reasonably estimable at this time.

OVERVIEW 
 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As such, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including securities of private or micro-cap public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, for tax purposes we are treated as a corporation and are subject to federal and state taxes on our income. FCM serves as our investment adviser and manages the investment process on a daily basis. 
 
 Our investment objective is to seek long-term growth of capital, principally by seeking capital gains on our equity and equity-related investments. There can be no assurance that we will achieve our investment objective. Under normal circumstances, we invest at least 80 of our net assets for investment purposes in technology companies. We consider technology companies to be those companies that derive at least 50 of their revenues from products and/or services within the information technology sector or in the cleantech sector. Information technology companies include, but are not limited to, those focused on computer hardware, software, telecommunications, networking, Internet, and consumer electronics. While there is no standard definition of cleantech, it is generally regarded as including goods and services designed to harness renewable energy and materials, eliminate emissions and waste, and reduce the use of natural resources. In addition, under normal circumstances we invest at least 70 of our total assets in privately held companies and public companies with market capitalizations of less than 250 million. Our portfolio is primarily composed of equity and equity derivative securities of technology and cleantech companies (as defined above). These investments generally range between 1 million and 10 million each, although the investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We acquire our investments through direct investments in private companies, negotiations with selling shareholders, and in organized secondary marketplaces for private securities. 
 
 While our primary focus is to invest in illiquid private technology and cleantech companies, we also may invest in micro-cap publicly traded companies. In addition, we may invest up to 30 percent of the portfolio in opportunistic investments that do not constitute the private companies and micro-cap public companies described above. These other investments may include investments in securities of public companies that are actively traded or in actively traded derivative securities such as options on securities or security indices. These other investments may also include investments in high-yield bonds, distressed debt, or securities of public companies that are actively traded and securities of companies located outside of the United States. Our investment activities are managed by FCM. 
 
 PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION 
 
 We make investments in securities of both public and private companies. Our portfolio investments consist principally of equity and equity-like securities, including common and preferred stock, warrants for the purchase of common and preferred stock, and convertible and term notes. The fair value of our investment portfolio was approximately 1.4 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 8.7 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The following table summarizes the fair value of our investment portfolio by industry sector as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

MATURITY OF PRIVATE COMPANIES IN THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO 
 
 The Fund invests in private companies at various stages of maturity. As our portfolio companies mature, they move from the early (development) stage to the middle (revenue) stage and then to the late stage. We expect that this continuous progression may create a pipeline of potential exit opportunities through initial public offerings (IPOs) or acquisitions. Of course, some companies do not progress. The illustration below describes typical characteristics of companies at each stage of maturity and where we believe our current portfolio companies fit within these categories. We expect some of our portfolio companies to transition between stages of maturity over time. The transition may be forward if the company is maturing and is successfully executing its business plan or may be backward if the company is not successfully executing its business plan or decides to change its business plan substantially from its original plan. 

EARLY STAGE 
 MIDDLE STAGE 
 LATE STAGE 

Developing product or service for market, high level of research and development, little or no revenue. 
 Established product, customers, business model; limited revenues. 
 Appreciable revenue; may be break-even or profitable; IPO or acquisition candidate. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 INVESTMENT INCOME 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had investment income of 35,792 primarily attributable to interest accrued on convertible/term note investments with Hera Systems and money market funds. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had investment loss of (234,126) primarily attributable to interest accrued on convertible/term note investments with Hera Systems. 
 
 The higher level of investment income in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was due to decline in accrued interest on current notes was due to a downward adjustment to accrued interest taken during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 . 
 
 OPERATING EXPENSES 
 
 Operating expenses totaled approximately 391,753 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and (2,099,513) during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

Significant components of net operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were management fee expense waiver of 19,472 (see Note 4), professional fees (audit, legal, and consulting) of 194,475, director fees of 169,445 and compliance fees 27,811. 
 
 Significant components of net operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were a management fee waiver of (2,500,000), printing fees of 106,912 and professional fees (audit, legal, and consulting) of 87,623. 
 
 The higher level of net operating expenses for the three months ended ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily attributed to the waiver of management fees in September 2023 (see Note 4). 
 
 NET INVESTMENT INCOME/(LOSS) 
 
 The net investment income/(loss) before taxes was (355,961) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 1,865,387 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The lower level of net investment loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net investment gain for the three months ended September 30, 2023, is primarily attributed to decrease in management fees and the waiver of management fees (see Note 4)

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net realized losses of 11,686,668. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net unrealized depreciation on total investments increased by 12,568,856. The change in net unrealized appreciation and depreciation of our private investments is based on portfolio asset valuations determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. This change in net unrealized depreciation was primarily attributable to the sale of Hera Systems. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized net realized losses of approximately 1. 
 
 NET INCREASE/(DECREASE) IN ASSETS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS AND CHANGE IN NET ASSETS PER SHARE

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 This discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements will require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we will describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements. 
 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 
 As a business development company, we generally invest in illiquid equity and equity derivatives of securities of venture capital stage technology companies. Under written procedures established by our board of directors, securities traded on stock exchanges, or quoted by NASDAQ, are valued according to the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. NASDAQ official closing price, if applicable, or at their last reported sale price as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE (normally 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time). If a security is not traded that day, the security will be valued at its most recent bid price. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market, but not quoted by NASDAQ, are valued at the last sale price (or, if the last sale price is not readily available, at the most recent closing bid price as quoted by brokers that make markets in the securities) at the close of trading on the NYSE. Securities traded both in the over-the-counter market and on a stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and most representative market. We obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). In addition, a large percentage of our portfolio investments are in the form of securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these securities quarterly at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. Our board of directors may use the services of a nationally recognized independent valuation firm to aid it in determining the fair value of these securities. 

48

Table of Contents 

The methods for valuing these securities may include: fundamental analysis (sales, income, or earnings multiples, etc.), discounts from market prices of similar securities, purchase price of securities, subsequent private transactions in the security or related securities, or discounts applied to the nature and duration of restrictions on the disposition of the securities, as well as a combination of these and other factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time, and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 We record interest or dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount, and market discount are capitalized, and we amortize any such amounts as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination is recorded as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. 
 
 Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation 
 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial statements upon effectiveness. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Inflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations in any of the reporting periods presented herein. However, our portfolio companies have experienced, and may in the future experience, the impacts of inflation on their operating results. 
 
 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 
 Subsequent to the close of the fiscal quarter on September 30, 2024, and through the date of the issuance of the financial statements included herein, there have been no material events related to our portfolio of investments. Since that date, there have been no purchases or sales of securities by the Fund. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

The Company s business activities contain elements of risk. We consider the principal types of market risk to be valuation risk and small company investment risk. 
 
 VALUATION RISK 
 
 Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is (i) the market price for those securities for which market quotations are readily available and (ii) fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the direction of, the Board of Directors for all other assets. 

49

Table of Contents 

Because there is typically no public market for our interests in the small privately-held companies in which we invest, the valuation of the securities in that portion of our portfolio is determined in good faith by our Board of Directors with the assistance of our Valuation Committee, comprised of the independent members of our Board of Directors, in accordance with our Valuation Procedures. In addition, the Board of Directors may use the services of a nationally recognized independent valuation firm to aid it in determining the fair value of some of these securities. In the absence of a readily ascertainable market value, the determined value of our portfolio of securities may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for such securities existed. Determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment, although our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining fair value of the portfolio investments. The methods for valuing these securities may include: fundamental analysis (sales, income, or earnings multiples, etc.), discounts from market prices of similar securities, purchase price of securities, subsequent private transactions in the security or related securities, or discounts applied to the nature and duration of restrictions on the disposition of the securities, as well as a combination of these and other factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time, and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. 
 
 Furthermore, changes in valuation of any of our investments in privately-held companies from one period to another may be volatile. 
 
 Investments in privately held, immature companies are inherently more volatile than investments in more mature businesses. Such immature businesses are inherently fragile and easily affected by both internal and external forces. 
 
 Our portfolio companies can lose much or all of their value suddenly in response to an internal or external adverse event. Conversely, these immature businesses can gain suddenly in value in response to an internal or external positive development. 
 
 The values assigned to our assets are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated or become readily marketable. Upon sale of investments, the values that are ultimately realized may be different from what is presently estimated. This difference could be material. 
 
 PRIVATELY PLACED SMALL COMPANIES RISK 
 
 The Company invests in small companies, and its investments in these companies are considered speculative in nature. The Company s investments often include securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale that adversely affect the liquidity and marketability of such securities. As a result, the Company is subject to risk of loss which may prevent our shareholders from achieving price appreciation, dividend distributions and return of capital. 
 
 WE CURRENTLY HOLD A PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IN CASH 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, a portion of the Company s assets was invested in cash and/or cash equivalents, which are expected to earn low yields. Given the current low interest rate environment, to the extent the management fee and other operating expenses exceed interest income on the cash holdings of the Company, the Company may experience losses. Furthermore, the investment advisory fee payable by us will not be reduced while our assets are invested in cash-equivalent securities. 
 
 In some cases, particularly for primary transactions, it is to our advantage to hold sufficient cash reserve so that we can make additional subsequent investments in these companies in order to (a) avoid having our earlier investments become diluted in future dilutive financings, (b) invest additional capital into existing portfolio companies in case additional investments are necessary, and/or (c) exercise warrants, options, or convertible securities that were acquired as part of the earlier transactions. For this reason, in the case of primary transactions (as opposed to secondary transactions where we do not buy the securities from the issuing companies but instead from existing stockholders), we typically reserve cash in an amount at least equal to our initial investment for such follow-on opportunities. Cash reserves held with respect to a particular investment should, therefore, decline as it is held longer, and will typically not be needed once that portfolio company becomes public or we determine it is no longer in our best interest to make investments in such portfolio company. 
 
 We may from time to time liquidate various investments. We are required to distribute substantially all of our net realized gains to stockholders on an annual basis and, therefore, will generally hold the proceeds of liquidated investments in cash pending its distribution.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 At a meeting held on August 11, 2013, the Board of Directors (the Board of the Company approved the continuation of the Company s Investment Management Agreement (the Agreement with Firsthand Capital Management, Inc. (the Adviser for an additional one -year period through August 31, 2024. 
 
 During the course of each year and in connection with their consideration of the continuation of the Agreement, the Board received various materials from the Adviser, including (i) information on the advisory personnel of the Adviser; (ii) information on the internal compliance procedures of the Adviser; (iii) comparative information showing how the Company s fees and expenses compare to other business development companies that follow investment strategies similar to those of the Company; (iv) information regarding brokerage and portfolio transactions; (vi) comparative information showing how the Company s performance compares to other business development companies that follow investment strategies similar to those of the Company; and (vii) information on any material legal proceedings or regulatory audits or investigations affecting the Company or the Adviser. 
 
 After receiving and reviewing these materials, the Board, at a meeting called for such purpose (the Meeting ), discussed the terms of the Agreement. The Meeting was held by video pursuant to an order issued on June 19, 2020 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing that business development companies are temporarily exempt from certain in-person board approval requirements, including with respect to the renewal of investment management agreements, due to conflicts related to the coronavirus. Representatives from the Adviser attended the Meeting and presented additional oral and written information to the Board to assist in its considerations. The Directors who are not parties to the Agreement or interested persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) of any such party (the Independent Directors also met in executive session to further discuss the terms of the Agreement and the information provided by the Adviser. 
 
 Discussed below are certain of the factors considered by the Board in continuing the Agreement. This discussion is not intended to be all-inclusive. The Board, including the Independent Directors, reviewed a variety of factors and considered a significant amount of information, including information received on an ongoing basis at Board and committee meetings and in various discussions with senior management of the Adviser relating specifically to the Adviser and the Agreement. The approval determination was made on the basis of each Director s business judgment after consideration of all the information taken as a whole. Individual Directors may have given different weight to certain factors and assigned various degrees of materiality to information received in connection with the contract review process. 
 
 Taking all of the information and deliberations into account, the Independent Directors reviewed various factors presented to them, the detailed information provided by the Adviser at the Meeting and at other times throughout the year, and other relevant information and the following factors, none of which was dispositive in their decision whether to approve the Agreement:

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services 
 
 The Board received and considered various data and information regarding the nature, extent and quality of services provided to the Company by the Adviser. The most recent Form ADV for the Adviser was provided to the Board, as were written and oral responses of the Adviser to an information request submitted by independent legal counsel on behalf of the Independent Directors. The Board reviewed these responses, which included among other things, information about the background and experience of the investment personnel of the Adviser primarily responsible for day-to-day portfolio management of the Company. The Board also reviewed the Adviser s overall ability to continue to manage and administer the Company as well as to oversee the service providers to the Company. 
 
 The Board evaluated the ability of the Adviser, considering its financial condition, resources, reputation and other attributes, to attract and retain highly qualified investment professionals, including research, advisory, supervisory and administrative personnel. In this regard, the Board considered information regarding the structure of the Adviser s compensation program for its personnel involved in the management and administration of the Company, including incentive and retirement plans. 
 
 The Board considered the effectiveness of policies of the Company in achieving the best execution of portfolio transactions, whether and to what extent soft dollar benefits are used, the extent to which efforts are made to recapture transaction costs and the controls applicable to brokerage allocation procedures. The Board recognized that the Company s investment transactions generally are privately negotiated by the Adviser in complex transactions rather than executed through a broker in a traditional exchange transaction. The Board reviewed the policies of the Adviser regarding the allocation of portfolio investment opportunities among the Company and other clients. The Board noted that the Adviser does not use traditional soft-dollar arrangements, where soft-dollar credits are generated based on the level of trades and then used for products or services from third parties. The Board also noted that the Adviser, from time to time, entered into arrangements where it received research (including invitations to conferences) from broker-dealers that the Adviser used to execute client trades, and that from time to time the Adviser had retained specialized technology consultants or other experts, at the expense of the Company with approval of the Board, for the purpose of evaluating some aspect of a prospective or existing portfolio holding. The Board also considered that the Adviser had outsourced the trading function to achieve certain operating efficiencies. 
 
 The Board also considered the market for the Company s stock and the challenges associated with the Company s raising additional capital under current market conditions. 
 
 In addition, the Board received and reviewed information on SEC and other inquiries, examinations and proceedings relating to the Company and the Adviser. The Board considered the investment and legal compliance programs of the Adviser, including its implementation of enhanced compliance policies and procedures in response to SEC rule changes and other regulatory initiatives, and the level of compliance attained by the Adviser. 
 
 Based on the above factors, together with those referenced below, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, concluded that it was generally satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of the investment advisory services provided to the Company by the Adviser. 
 
 Company Performance 
 
 The Board considered the Company s NAV performance and common stock performance results over the past year and since its inception on April 18, 2011. It also considered these results in comparison to the NAV performance results of the Company compared to relevant benchmark indices and comparable funds. The Board referenced the presentation regarding performance that had occurred earlier in the meeting. The Board noted that for the 12 -month period ended June 30, 2024, the Fund s NAV had fallen 91 while its stock price fell 96 . The Directors were reminded that in the third quarter of 2023, the Fund suffered substantial setbacks involving IntraOp and Wrightspeed that led to write downs of most or all of the value of our securities of those two issuers. Later, in the second quarter of 2024, Revasum failed, and its assets were foreclosed upon by its senior creditor and subsequently sold, leaving no proceeds for equity holders such as SVVC. In all, between June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2024, the Fund s gross assets declined from approximately 21 million to approximately 6 million due to the terminal failures of these three portfolio companies. The Board also considered the Advisor s attempts to improve shareholder value (and related practical constraints). In addition, the Board also reviewed FCM s efforts in working with the Board to explore the practicality of liquidation of the Company versus alternatives to liquidation of the Company. Specifically, the Board received an update from the Adviser during an executive session regarding the proposed transaction to merge the Fund with an operating company in the medical device field. The Board learned that the counterparty had chosen to abandon negotiations in favor of a competing transaction. The Board also reviewed the current state of affairs and options to move forward. 
 
 Investment Advisory Fee Rate and Other Expenses 
 
 The Board reviewed and considered the proposed contractual management fee rate and incentive fee payable by the Company to the Adviser for investment advisory services Advisory Fee Rate ). Additionally, the Board received and considered information comparing the Advisory Fee Rate and the total expense ratio of the Company with those of other funds in an appropriate peer universe. The Board noted that the Company s advisory fee structure was comparable to that of funds in the business development company comparison group, and given that many funds in the comparison group utilized leverage in their investment strategies, the Company s effective Advisory Fee Rate for holders of its common stock was lower than its peers. The Board also noted that the Advisor, in an effort to support the Company and help it to preserve cash, has not collected its accrued management fees for a number of years. In addition, the Adviser has also been paying for certain Company expenses to further help the Company to preserve cash.

Table of Contents 

Effective September 30, 2023, the Company has entered into a fee waiver agreement with FCM (the Fee Waiver Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Fee Waiver Agreement, FCM agrees to 1 waive future accruals of the base management fee starting October 1, 2023, through December 31, 2024, and 2 waive 2.5 million of base management fees that have been accrued but unpaid as of September 30, 2023. Effective March 31, 2024, the Company has entered into a fee waiver agreement with FCM (the Fee Waiver Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Fee Waiver Agreement, FCM agrees to waive 3.0 million of base management fees that have been accrued but unpaid as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 Profitability 
 
 The Board received and considered a profitability analysis of the Adviser with respect to the Company. The Board concluded that, in light of the costs of providing investment management and other services to the Company, the profits and other ancillary benefits that the Adviser received with regard to providing these services were not excessive. 
 
 Economies of Scale 
 
 The Board received and considered information regarding whether there have been economies of scale with respect to the management of the Company, whether the Company has appropriately benefited from any economies of scale, and whether there is potential for realization of any further economies of scale with respect to the Company. The consensus was that the Company is not large enough at this time to produce material economies of scale. 
 
 Information About Services to Other Clients 
 
 The Board also received and considered information about the services and fee rates offered by the Adviser to its other clients, namely Firsthand Technology Opportunities Fund and Firsthand Alternative Energy Fund, two registered investment companies also managed by the Adviser. The Board concluded that the Advisory Fee Rate charged by the Adviser to the Company was not comparable to other clients of the Adviser given the substantial differences in the services provided and the investment strategy employed. Where rates offered to those two clients were lower, the Board concluded that the costs associated with managing and operating a registered closed-end business development company when compared with a registered investment company provided a justification for a higher fee rate, notwithstanding a fee that contains a performance component. 
 
 Other Benefits to the Adviser 
 
 The Board received and considered information regarding potential fall-out or ancillary benefits to the Adviser as a result of its relationship with the Company. Such benefits could include, among others, benefits directly attributable to the relationship of the Adviser with the Company (such as soft dollar benefits) and benefits potentially derived from an increase in the business of the Adviser as a result of its relationship with the Company (such as the ability to market to shareholders other financial products offered by the Adviser). 
 
 Other Factors and Broader Review 
 
 Throughout the year, the Board regularly reviews and assesses the quality of the services that the Company receives from the Adviser. In this regard, the Board reviews reports of the Adviser in each of its quarterly meetings, which include, among other things, a detailed portfolio review and detailed fund performance reports. In addition, the Board interviews the portfolio manager of the Company at various times throughout the year. 
 
 Conclusion 
 
 After considering the aforementioned factors and based on its deliberations and evaluation of the information provided to it, the Board concluded that re-approval of the Company s Investment Management Agreement was in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.
