 million and million, respectively related to these VIEs. 
 Non-Consolidated VIEs 
 million and of investment assets in the form of equity interests issued by non-corporate legal entities determined under the guidance to be VIEs, such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies, including CLOs, hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate-related funds. As an equity investor, the Company is considered to have a variable interest in each of these VIEs as a result of its participation in the risks and/or rewards these funds were designed to create by their defined portfolio objectives and strategies. Primarily through qualitative assessment, including consideration of related party interests or other financial arrangements, if any, the Company was not identified as the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs, largely due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Consequently, the Company continues to reflect these equity interests in the consolidated balance sheets as other equity investments and applies the equity method of accounting for these positions. The net assets of these non-consolidated VIEs are approximately million and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s maximum exposure to loss from its direct involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of its investment of million and and approximately million and million of unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has no further economic interest in these VIEs in the form of guarantees, derivatives, credit enhancements or similar instruments and obligations. 
 
 Impact of Assumption Updates 
 The net impact of assumption changes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased remeasurement of liability for future policy benefits by million, decreased policyholders benefits by million, increased market risk benefits and purchased market risk benefits by million, and decreased other operating costs and expenses by million. This resulted in an increase in income (loss) from operations, before income taxes of million and an increase to net income (loss) by million. 
 The net impact of assumption changes in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased remeasurement of liability for future policy benefits by million, decreased policyholders benefits by million, decreased market risk benefits and purchased market risk benefits by million, and decreased other operating costs and expenses by million. This resulted in an increase in income (loss) from operations, before income taxes of million and an increase to net income (loss) by million.

 The Company maintains a diversified portfolio of corporate securities across industries and issuers and does not have exposure to any single issuer in excess of of total corporate securities. The largest exposures to a single issuer of corporate securities held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively, representing and of the consolidated equity of the Company. 
 Corporate high yield securities, consisting primarily of public high yield bonds, are classified as other than investment grade by the various rating agencies, i.e., a rating below Baa3/BBB- or the NAIC designation of 3 (medium investment grade), 4 or 5 (below investment grade) or 6 (in or near default). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, approximately million and million, or and , of the billion and billion aggregate amortized cost of fixed maturities held by the Company were considered to be other than investment grade. These securities had gross unrealized losses of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the million and million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in corporate securities. In accordance with the policy described in Note 2 of the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company concluded that an allowance for credit losses for these securities was not warranted at either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not intend to sell the securities nor will it likely be required to dispose of the securities before the anticipated recovery of their remaining amortized cost basis. 
 Based on the Company s evaluation both qualitatively and quantitatively of the drivers of the decline in fair value of fixed maturity securities as of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that the unrealized loss was primarily due to increases in interest rates and credit spreads. 
 
 million and million. The agreements require a minimum of of the fair value of the loaned securities to be held as cash collateral, calculated daily. To further minimize the credit risks related to these programs, the financial condition of counterparties is monitored on a regular basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash collateral received in the amount of million and million was invested by the agent bank. A securities lending payable for the overnight and continuous loans is included in other liabilities in the amount of cash collateral received. Securities lending transactions are used to generate income. Income and expenses associated with these transactions are reported as net investment income and were not material for the September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and accrued interest was written off for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Equity-Based and Treasury Futures Contracts Margin 
 All outstanding equity-based futures contracts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are exchange-traded and net settled daily in cash. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company had open exchange-traded futures positions on: (i) the S P 500, Nasdaq, Russell 2000 and Emerging Market indices, having initial margin requirements of million and million and (ii) the 2-year, 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes on U.S. Treasury bonds and ultra-long bonds, having initial margin requirements of million and million. 
 Collateral Arrangements 
 The Company generally has executed a CSA under the ISDA Master Agreement it maintains with each of its OTC derivative counterparties that requires both posting and accepting collateral either in the form of cash or high-quality securities, such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government and government agency securities and investment grade corporate bonds. The Company nets the fair value of all derivative financial instruments with counterparties for which an ISDA Master Agreement and related CSA have been executed. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company held billion and million in cash and securities collateral delivered by trade counterparties, representing the fair value of the related derivative agreements. The unrestricted cash collateral is reported in other invested assets. The Company posted collateral of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in the normal operation of its collateral arrangements. The Company is exposed to losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial derivative transactions with a positive fair value. The Company manages credit risk by: (i) entering into derivative transactions with highly rated major international financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties governed by master netting agreements, as applicable; (ii) trading through central clearing and OTC parties; (iii) obtaining collateral, such as cash and securities, when appropriate; and (iv) setting limits on single party credit exposures which are subject to periodic management review. 
 Substantially all of the Company s derivative agreements have zero thresholds which require daily full collateralization by the party in a liability position. In addition, certain of the Company s derivative agreements contain credit-risk related contingent features; if the credit rating of one of the parties to the derivative agreement is to fall below a certain level, the party with positive fair value could request termination at the then fair value or demand immediate full collateralization from the party whose credit rating fell and is in a net liability position.

 Level 3 Financial Instruments for which Quantitative Inputs are Not Available 
 Certain Privately Placed Debt Securities with Limited Trading Activity 
 Excluded from the tables above as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are approximately million and million of Level 3 fair value measurements of investments for which the underlying quantitative inputs are not developed by the Company and are not readily available. These investments primarily consist of certain privately placed debt securities with limited trading activity, and their fair values generally reflect unadjusted prices obtained from independent valuation service providers and indicative, non-binding quotes obtained from third-party broker-dealers recognized as market participants. Significant increases or decreases in the fair value amounts received from these pricing sources may result in the Company reporting significantly higher or lower fair value measurements for these Level 3 investments. 
 The fair value of private placement securities is determined by application of a matrix pricing model or a market comparable company value technique. The significant unobservable input to the matrix pricing model valuation technique is the spread over the industry-specific benchmark yield curve. Generally, an increase or decrease in spreads would lead to directionally inverse movement in the fair value measurements of these securities. The significant unobservable input to the market comparable company valuation technique is the discount rate. Generally, a significant increase (decrease) in the discount rate would result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurements of these securities.

 Modco receivable Policyholders liabilities: Investment contracts Separate Accounts liabilities 
 
 Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
 Fair values for commercial and residential mortgage loans on real estate are measured by discounting future contractual cash flows to be received on the mortgage loan using interest rates at which loans with similar characteristics and credit quality would be made. The discount rate is derived based on the appropriate U.S. Treasury rate with a like term to the remaining term of the loan to which a spread reflective of the risk premium associated with the specific loan is added. Fair values for mortgage loans anticipated to be foreclosed and problem mortgage loans are limited to the fair value of the underlying collateral, if lower. 
 Policy Loans 
 The fair value of policy loans is calculated by discounting expected cash flows based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve and historical loan repayment patterns.

This adjustment was recorded in other comprehensive income. A valuation allowance of million remains against the portion of the deferred tax asset that is still not more-likely-than-not to be realized. 
 The Company uses the aggregate portfolio approach related to the stranded or disproportionate income tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income related to available for sale securities. Under this approach, the disproportionate tax effect remains intact as long as the investment portfolio remains.

 For other matters, the Company is currently not able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from plaintiffs and other parties, investigation of factual allegations, rulings by a court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts and the progress of settlement discussions. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation and regulatory contingencies and updates the Company s accruals, disclosures and reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews.

 prescribed and permitted practices resulted in surplus that is different from the statutory surplus that would have been reported had NAIC statutory accounting practices been applied. 
 During 2022, Equitable Life Financial Insurance Company of America received approval from the Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions pursuant to A.R.S. 20-515 for Separate Account No. 68A SA 68A for our Structured Capital Strategies product, Separate Account No. 69A SA 69A for our EQUI-VEST product Structured Investment Option and Separate Account No. 71A SA 71A for our Investment Edge Structured Investment Option, to permit us to use book value as the accounting basis of these three non-insulated Separate Accounts instead of fair value in accordance with the NAIC Accounting and Practices and Procedures Manual to align with how we manage and measure our overall general account asset portfolio. The impact of the application is a decrease of approximately million in statutory surplus as of September 30, 2024.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction (H)(2)(a) of Form 10-Q. The management s narrative that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein, with the information provided under Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements and Information included elsewhere herein and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A in Part II, Item 7 and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A included in Equitable America s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ). The management s narrative that follows represents a discussion and analysis of Equitable America s financial condition and results of operations and not the financial condition and results of operations of Equitable Holdings, Inc. Holdings ). 
 
 Executive Summary 
 Overview 
 We are an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. Our primary business is to provide life insurance, annuity, and employee benefit products to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses. We are licensed to sell our products in 49 states (not including New York), the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 
 Macroeconomic and Industry Trends 
 Our business and consolidated results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions and consumer confidence, conditions in the global capital markets and the interest rate environment. 
 Financial and Economic Environment 
 A wide variety of factors continue to impact financial and economic conditions. These factors include, among others, uncertainty regarding the federal debt limit, concerns regarding inflation, high fuel and energy costs, changes in fiscal or monetary policy and geopolitical tensions, including the U.S. presidential election. The Russian invasion of the Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war and broader Middle Eastern regional hostilities, including with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran, and the ensuing conflicts and the sanctions and other measures imposed in response to these conflicts significantly increased the level of volatility in the financial markets and have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty. 
 Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in the capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio. In addition, our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors, including equity market performance and interest rates. An increase in market volatility could continue to affect our business, including through effects on the yields we earn on invested assets, changes in required reserves and capital and fluctuations in the value of our AUM and AV, from which we derive our fee income. These effects could be exacerbated by uncertainty about future fiscal policy, changes in tax policy, the scope of potential deregulation and levels of global trade. 
 The potential for increased volatility could pressure sales and reduce demand for our products as consumers consider purchasing alternative products to meet their objectives. In addition, this environment could make it difficult to consistently develop products that are attractive to customers. Financial performance can be adversely affected by market volatility and equity market declines as fees driven by AV and AUM fluctuate, hedging costs increase and revenues decline due to reduced sales and increased outflows. U.S. equity markets showed strength overall in the third quarter 2024, benefiting from a resilient U.S. economy with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics issuing a strong September 2024 jobs report that exceeded expectations, cooling inflation, and a widely held outlook for monetary easing, including a half-point interest rate reduction in September 2024, with additional, smaller rate cuts expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025 (based on statements of members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). 
 We monitor the behavior of our customers and other factors, including mortality rates, morbidity rates, annuitization rates and lapse and surrender rates, which change in response to changes in capital market conditions, to ensure that our products and solutions remain attractive and profitable. For additional information on our sensitivity to interest rates and capital market prices, see Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Conditions in the Financial Markets and Economy and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 Regulatory Developments 
 Insurance Regulation 
 Regulation of Investments 
 We are regulated primarily by the Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions, with some policies and products also subject to federal regulation. On an ongoing basis, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards. Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact our statutory reserve and capital requirements. 
 The NAIC is evaluating the risks associated with insurers investments in certain categories of structured securities, including CLOs. In March 2023, the NAIC adopted an amendment to the Purposes and Procedures Manual to give the NAIC s Structured Securities Group, housed within the NAIC s Securities Valuation Office (the SVO ), responsibility for modeling CLO securities and evaluating tranche level losses across all debt and equity tranches under a series of calibrated and weighted collateral stress scenarios in order to assign NAIC designations. Under the amended Purposes and Procedures Manual, CLO investments will no longer be broadly exempt from filing with the SVO based on ratings from Credit Rating Providers. The NAIC s goal is to ensure that the weighted average RBC factor for owning all tranches of a CLO more closely aligns with what would be required for directly owning all of the underlying loan collateral, in order to avoid RBC arbitrage. In June 2024, the NAIC approved interim rules that raise capital requirements for holdings of CLO and other asset-backed security residual interests. The NAIC is also collaborating with interested parties to develop and refine the process for modeling CLO investments. In August 2024, the NAIC delayed a requirement for insurers to begin reporting the financially modeled NAIC designations for CLOs with their year-end 2024 financial statement filings to year-end 2025 to allow more time to develop the modeling methodology. 
 Fiduciary Rules 
 In 2023, the U.S. Department of Labor (the DOL proposed a regulation to change the definition of fiduciary for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA and parallel provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and proposed amendments to various existing prohibited transaction exemptions PTEs ), including PTE 84-14 that financial professionals rely on when they make investment recommendations to retirement investors. On April 23, 2024, the DOL finalized and published this new definition of fiduciary for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code and finalized and published amendments to these PTEs (the new definition and the PTE amendments collectively, the Final Rule ). 
 Various industry groups brought litigation against the DOL seeking a variety of remedies for the Final Rule. On July 25, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the E.D. Tex. issued a stay of the effective date of portions of the Final Rule. On July 26, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the N.D. Tex. issued a stay of the effective date of the Final Rule as a whole. As a result of these court opinions, it is uncertain whether the Final Rule will become effective. 
 The DOL has appealed the stay issued in the E.D. Tex. litigation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The DOL has also filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the stay issued in the N.D. Tex. litigation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit; the parties have jointly agreed to stay further proceedings pending the outcome of the interlocutory appeal. 
 For additional information on the regulatory developments and risk we face, see Business Regulation and Risk Factors Legal and Regulatory Risks in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues come from three principal sources: 
 fee income derived from our products; 
 premiums from our traditional life insurance, annuity, and employee benefits products; and 
 investment income from our General Account investment portfolio. 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 Our fee income varies directly in relation to the amount of the underlying AV or benefit base of our life insurance and annuity products which are influenced by changes in economic conditions, primarily equity market returns, as well as net flows. Our premium income is driven by the growth in new policies written and covered lives, and the persistency of our in-force policies, which are influenced by a combination of factors, including our efforts to attract and retain customers and market conditions that influence demand for our products. Our investment income is driven by the yield on our General Account investment portfolio and is impacted by the prevailing level of interest rates as we reinvest cash associated with maturing investments and net flows to the portfolio. 
 Benefits and Other Deductions 
 Our primary expenses are: 
 policyholders benefits and interest credited to policyholders account balances; 
 sales commissions and compensation paid to intermediaries and advisors that distribute our products and services; and 
 compensation and benefits provided to Equitable Financial s employees and other operating expenses. 
 Policyholders benefits are driven primarily by mortality, morbidity, customer withdrawals and benefits which change in response to changes in capital market conditions. In addition, some of our policyholders benefits are directly tied to the AV and benefit base of our variable annuity products. Interest credited to policyholders varies in relation to the amount of the underlying AV or benefit base. Sales commissions and compensation paid to intermediaries and advisors vary in relation to premium and fee income generated from these sources, whereas compensation and benefits to Equitable Financial s employees are more constant and impacted by market wages and decline with increases in efficiency. Our ability to manage these expenses across various economic cycles and products is critical to the profitability of our company. 
 
 Significant Factors Impacting Our Results 
 The following significant factors have impacted, and may in the future impact, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Impact of Hedging on Results 
 We have offered and continue to offer variable annuity and life insurance products. The future claims exposure on these features is sensitive to movements in the equity markets and interest rates. Accordingly, we have implemented hedging programs designed to mitigate the economic exposure to us from these features due to equity market and interest rate movements. Changes in the values of the derivatives associated with these programs due to equity market and interest rate movements are recognized in the periods in which they occur while corresponding changes in offsetting liabilities not measured at fair value, are recognized over time. This results in net income volatility. 
 Effect of Assumption Updates on Operating Results 
 Our actuaries oversee the valuation of the product liabilities and assets and review the underlying inputs and assumptions. We comprehensively review the actuarial assumptions underlying these valuations and update assumptions during the third quarter of each year. Assumptions are based on a combination of Company experience, industry experience, management actions and expert judgment and reflect our best estimate as of the date of the applicable financial statements. Changes in assumptions can result in a significant change to the carrying value of product liabilities and assets and, consequently, the impact could be material to earnings in the period of the change. 
 Most of the variable annuity products, variable universal life insurance and universal life insurance products we offer maintain policyholder deposits that are reported as liabilities and classified within either Separate Accounts liabilities or policyholder account balances. Our products and riders also impact liabilities for future policyholder benefits, market risk benefits and unearned revenues and assets for DAC and DSI. The valuation of these assets and liabilities (other than deposits) is based on differing accounting methods depending on the product, each of which requires numerous assumptions and considerable judgment. The accounting guidance applied in the valuation of these assets and liabilities includes, but is not limited to, the following: (i) universal life insurance and variable life insurance secondary guarantees for which benefit liabilities are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments; and (ii) certain product guarantees reported as market risk benefits at fair value. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 For further details of our accounting policies and related judgments pertaining to assumption updates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Assumption Updates and Model Changes 
 We conduct our annual review of our assumptions and models during the third quarter of each year. We also update our assumptions as needed in the event we become aware of economic conditions or events that could require a change in assumptions that we believe may have a significant impact to the carrying value of product liabilities and assets and consequently materially impact our earnings in the period of the change. 
 2024 Assumption Updates 
 The impact of the assumption update during 2024 was an increase of 20 million to income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes and an increase to net income (loss) of 16 million. 
 The net impact of this assumption update on income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes of 20 million consisted of a decrease in remeasurement of liability for future policy benefits of 9 million, a decrease in policyholders benefits of 6 million, an increase in change in market risk benefits and purchased market risk benefits of 12 million and a decrease in other operating costs and expenses of 17 million. 
 2023 Assumption Updates 
 The impact of the assumption update during 2023 was an increase of 50 million to income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes and an increase to net income (loss) of 40 million. 
 The net impact of this assumption update on income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes of 50 million consisted of an increase in remeasurement of liability for future policy benefits of 1 million, a decrease in policyholders benefits of 1 million, a decrease in change in market risk benefits and purchased market risk benefits of 8 million and a decrease in other operating costs and expenses of 42 million. 
 Model Changes 
 There were no material model changes in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Equitable America 
 Net income attributable to Equitable America decreased 121 million, to net income of 473 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a net income of 594 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The following were notable changes in net income (loss): 
 Unfavorable items included: 
 Change in market risk benefits and purchased market risk benefits increased by 930 million mainly due to less favorable interest rate movements in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. This was partially offset by more favorable equity market movements in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, impacting the assumed liabilities from the Reinsurance Treaty effective April 1, 2023. 
 Interest credited to policyholders account balances increased by 454 million primarily due to business assumed as part of the Reinsurance Treaty and growth of SCS. 
 Policyholders benefits increased by 253 million mainly due to business assumed as part of the Reinsurance Treaty and unfavorable claims. 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 Compensation, benefits, amortization of reinsurance deposits assets and other operating expenses increased by 289 million mainly due to expense recognition related to the reinsurance deposit assets and expenses related to the assumed business as part of the Reinsurance Treaty. 
 Commissions increased by 139 million primarily due to business assumed as part of the Reinsurance Treaty and an increase in sales related to business growth resulting from our initiative to begin offering a full suite of variable annuity products to policyholders located outside of New York. 
 Income tax expense increased 52 million due to a full release of the valuation allowance of 69 million on the deferred tax asset for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to no valuation allowance release in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by less pre-tax income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 These were partially offset by the following favorable items: 
 Net derivative losses decreased 895 million mainly due to lower net embedded derivatives losses related to funds withheld and modified coinsurance portfolios related to the Reinsurance Treaty. 
 Fee-type revenue increased by 664 million mainly due to the Reinsurance Treaty and business growth, primarily driven by an increase in employee benefit premiums, and to a lesser extent from our initiative to begin offering a full suite of variable products to policyholders located outside of New York. 
 Net investment income increased by 432 million mainly due to higher average asset balances and higher investment yields. 
 
 Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining: 
 market risk benefits and purchased market risk benefits; 
 accounting for reinsurance; 
 estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values and investment impairments; 
 estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation; 
 measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and 
 liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters. 
 In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries while others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Due to the material weakness described below, the Company s CEO and CFO, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 62 

Table of Contents 

 As previously reported, the Company identified a material weakness in the design and operation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. We did not timely design and implement effective controls over the Internal Reinsurance Treaty. Specifically, controls were not adequately designed or implemented to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the recording of the transaction in accordance with the contractual terms of the Internal Reinsurance Treaty. We have concluded that the deficiency constituted a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting. 
 Remediation Status of Material Weakness 
 Management continues to execute its plan moving towards remediation of the material weakness. Since identifying the material weakness, management is in the process of designing and implementing new controls to capture the completeness and accuracy of the Internal Reinsurance Treaty contractual terms. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial processes and procedures have been in place for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Accordingly, the material weakness is not remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than as described above, with respect to ongoing remediation efforts, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
