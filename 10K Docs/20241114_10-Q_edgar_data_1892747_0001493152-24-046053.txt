Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment

by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust
Account to the Company s shareholders, as described below. As further described below, on March 1, 2024, pursuant to the IMTA Amendment

Prior
to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, on October 4, 2021, the Sponsor paid to cover certain offering costs of the
Company in consideration for Class B ordinary shares, par value per share (the Class B ordinary shares 
or the Founder Shares ). The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to shares that were subject to forfeiture
depending on the extent to which the underwriters over-allotment option was exercised, so that the number of Founder Shares would
equal, on an as-converted basis, approximately of the Company s issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the Initial Public
Offering (assuming each of the Sponsor and Valuence Partners LP did not purchase any Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering). Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor transferred Founder Shares to Valuence Partners LP, an investment
fund affiliated with the Sponsor. As a result of the underwriters election to partially exercise their over-allotment option 
Class B ordinary shares were forfeited, resulting in the Sponsor and Valuence Partners LP holding an aggregate of Founder Shares. 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward
consummating a Business Combination. The stock exchange listing rules require that the Business Combination must be with one or more
operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the
amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in the Trust Account and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account).
The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the issued
and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it
not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

The
Company will provide the holders of the Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a
portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a general meeting called
to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder
approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders
will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares, for a per share redemption price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on
deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest
(which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares. The per-share amount
to be distributed to the Public Shareholders who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions
the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business
Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. 

If
a shareholder vote is not required in connection with a Business Combination and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote
for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association, as amended (the Articles ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included
in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection
with a Business Combination, the holders of the Company s shares prior to the Initial Public Offering (the Initial Shareholders have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving
a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, without voting, and if they do
vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against a proposed Business Combination. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant
to the tender offer rules, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder
is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
 Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of of the Public
Shares without the Company s prior written consent. 

The
Initial Shareholders have each agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by
it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Articles (i) to modify the
substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company s Business Combination
or to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined
below) or (ii) with respect to any other material provision relating to the rights of Public Shareholders, unless the Company provides
the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price,
payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account and
not previously released to pay taxes, divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares. 

The
Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder
Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Shareholders or
any of their respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust
Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive
their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete
a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the
Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that
the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ). 

In
order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent
any claims by a third party (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality, or
other similar agreement for a Business Combination, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) 
per Public Share and (2) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust
Account due to reductions in the value of trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes.
This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access
to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In
the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent
of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify
the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements
with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

Combination Period in one-month increments up to eighteen (18) additional times, or a total of up to thirty-six (36) months after
the Initial Public Offering, until up to March 3, 2025. In connection with such extensions to the Combination Period, the Sponsor or
its designees was required to deposit into the Trust Account, as a loan, 
for the extension to September 3, 2023 and 
for each monthly extension thereafter (each, a Contribution ). The Company s shareholders also approved an
amendment to the Articles to eliminate (i) the limitation that the Company may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would

agreement relating to, such Business Combination. The Company s shareholders also approved an amendment to the Articles to
permit a holder of the Company s Class B ordinary shares to convert such shares into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one
basis at any time and from time to time prior to the closing of a Business Combination at the election of the holder. In connection
with the May 2023 Meeting, holders of 
Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption exercised their right to redeem such shares. As a result, the Company paid

On
June 3, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting (the June 2024 Meeting ), where shareholders approved
an amendment to the Articles to extend the Combination Period from June 3, 2024 for an initial two month period to August 3, 2024

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of , and a working capital deficit of . 

Based
on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity from the Sponsor
or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors to meet its needs through the earlier of the
consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. However, the Working Capital Loans (as defined below) and the June
2024 Note will provide additional flexibility to continue the identification and pursuit of potential Business Combination targets. Over
this time period, the Company will be using available funds, including those from the Working Capital Loans, for the purpose of paying
existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective
target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating
and consummating the Business Combination. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company has until up to March 3, 2026, if the Company, without shareholder approval,
elects to further extend such deadline and causes to be deposited the New Contributions in connection with each monthly extension of
the Combination Period, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business
Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by the end of the Combination Period, there will be a mandatory
liquidation of the Trust Account and potential subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity condition
and mandatory liquidation of the Trust Account, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts
of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after the end of the Combination Period (up to March 3, 2026, if
the Company, without shareholder approval, elects to further extend the Combination Period monthly to such deadline).

warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the underwriters exercise
of their over-allotment option as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC
480 ), and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants
are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants
meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s
own ordinary shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside
of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional
judgment, is conducted at the time warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

For
issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component
of issuance costs of temporary equity at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all of the criteria for
equity classification, the warrant issuance costs are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and
each balance sheet date thereafter. The fair value of the Public Warrants has been estimated using its quoted market price as of September
30, 2024. As the Company s warrants meet the criteria for equity classification, the Company has accounted for the warrants as
equity classified.

per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement, consisting of 2,666,667 Private Placement Warrants issued to our Sponsor and 4,000,000
Private Placement Warrants issued to Valuence Partners LP, generating gross proceeds of 10,000,000. 

Simultaneously
with the exercise of the over-allotment, we consummated the sale of an additional 267,995 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor,
generating gross proceeds of 401,993. 

Offering
costs for the Initial Public Offering and the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option amounted to 10,718,994, consisting
of 4,000,000 of underwriting fees, net of 2,200,996 reimbursed from the underwriters, 8,105,480 of deferred underwriting fees payable
(which are held in the Trust Account) and 814,510 of other costs. The 8,105,480 of deferred underwriting fee payable is contingent
upon the consummation of a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering and partial exercise of the over-allotment, 226,702,619 10.30 per Unit) from the net proceeds
of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the Trust Account and was invested
in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185
days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by us meeting the conditions
of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of (i) the
completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account. On March 1, 2024, the Company entered into the IMTA
Amendment, which provides that the trustee of the Trust Account may, at the direction of the Company (i) hold funds uninvested, (ii)
hold funds in an interest-bearing or non-interest bearing bank demand deposit account at a U.S. chartered commercial bank with consolidated
assets of 100 billion or more selected by the trustee that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or (iii) invest and reinvest the
Property (as defined in the IMTA) in solely United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act, having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3)
and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act (or any successor rule), which invest only in direct U.S. government
treasury obligations, as determined by the Company. On the same day, pursuant to the IMTA Amendment, the Company instructed Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company to move the Trust Account out of an investment in securities and into an interest-bearing bank deposit
account. As a result, the remaining proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants are no longer invested
in U.S. government securities or money market funds. Investing in our securities is not intended for persons who are seeking a return
on investments in government securities or investment securities.

In
connection with May 2023 Meeting, as described below, shareholders holding an aggregate of 15,799,245 Class A ordinary shares properly
exercised their right to redeem their shares for 167,831,206. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in our Trust Account
was approximately 65.7 million. In connection June 2024 Meeting, shareholders holding an aggregate of 4,343,316 Class A ordinary shares
properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for 49,900,380. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in our
Trust Account was approximately 21.9 million as of September 30, 2024. 

We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust
Account (less taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or
in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

Extraordinary
General Meetings 

On
May 25, 2023, the Company held the May 2023 Meeting, where shareholders approved, among other things, an amendment to the Articles
to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a Business Combination from June 3, 2023 to September 3, 2023 and to allow
the Company, without another shareholder vote, by resolution of the Board of Directors, to elect to further extend the Combination
Period in one-month increments up to eighteen (18) additional times, or a total of up to thirty-six (36) months after the Initial
Public Offering, until up to March 3, 2025. In connection with such extensions to the Combination Period, the Sponsor or its
designees was required to deposit into the Trust Account, as a loan, 420,000 for the extension to September 3, 2023 and 140,000
for each monthly extension thereafter. The Company s shareholders also approved an amendment to the Articles to eliminate (i)
the limitation that the Company may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause the Company s net tangible assets
to be less than 5,000,001 and (ii) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate a Business Combination unless the Company
has net tangible assets of at least 5,000,001 immediately prior to, or upon consummation of, or any greater net tangible asset or
cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to, such Business Combination. The Company s shareholders
also approved an amendment to the Articles to permit a holder of the Company s Class B ordinary shares to convert such shares
into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis at any time and from time to time prior to the closing of a Business Combination
at the election of the holder. In connection with the May 2023 Meeting, holders of 15,799,245 Class A ordinary shares subject to
possible redemption exercised their right to redeem such shares. As a result, the Company paid 167,831,206 (or 10.62 per share) to
the redeeming shareholders. After redemptions the Company had 6,210,718 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption
outstanding. The Company, with the approval by the Board of Directors, extended the Combination Period to June 3, 2024 and caused to
be deposited an additional 1,680,000 into the Company s Trust Account. 

On
June 3, 2024, the Company held the June 2024 Meeting, where shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles to extend the
Combination Period from June 3, 2024 for an initial two month period to August 3, 2024 and to permit the Company, without another
shareholder vote, by resolution of the Board of Directors to elect to further extend such date up to nineteen (19) additional times
for an additional one (1) month each time, up to March 3, 2026, provided that the Sponsor or its designees deposit into the Trust
Account (i) on June 4, 2024, with respect to the initial extension, an amount equal to the lesser of (x) 60,000 or (y) 0.03 per
public share multiplied by the number of Public Shares outstanding and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by
the Company that the Board of Directors has elected to further extend such date for an additional month, an amount equal to the
lesser of (x) 30,000 or (y) 0.015 per public share multiplied by the number of Public Shares outstanding. In connection with the
June 2024 Meeting, holders of 4,343,316 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption exercised their right to redeem such
shares. As a result, the Company paid 49,900,380 (or 11.49 per share) to the redeeming shareholders. After redemptions the Company
had 1,867,402 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption outstanding.

Convertible
Promissory Notes 

On
June 5, 2023, in connection with the required Contributions for monthly extensions to the Combination Period and for working capital
purposes, the Company issued a non-interest bearing, unsecured convertible promissory note to the Sponsor in the aggregate principal
amount of 613,207 and to Valuence Partners LP in the aggregate principal amount of 1,650,941. The Contribution Notes will be repayable
by the Company upon the earlier of (i) consummation of a Business Combination and (ii) the date of the liquidation of the Company. Such
loans may be converted into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at the option of the payees, which shall have terms identical
to the Private Placement Warrants. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, the
outstanding principal amount of the Contribution Notes will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited,
eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Contribution Notes were accounted for using the bifurcation method and it was determined that the
conversion feature had no value and the Contribution Notes were recorded at par value. As of September 30, 2024, 613,207 is outstanding
under the Sponsor Convertible Promissory Note and 1,650,941 has been borrowed against VP Convertible Promissory Note. 

On
June 4, 2024, the Company issued the June 2024 Note to the Sponsor, in the principal amount of 300,000. The June 2024 Note bears no
interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination
or (b) the date of the Company s liquidation. If the Company does not consummate an initial Business Combination by the Maturity
Date, the June 2024 Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise
forgiven. Upon maturity, the outstanding principal balance of the June 2024 Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of 1.50
per warrant, at the option of the Sponsor, provided that the maximum aggregate conversion of all convertible notes issued to the Sponsor
or its affiliates may not exceed 1.5 million. Such warrants will have terms identical to the Private Placement Warrants. On June 4,
2024, the Company borrowed 300,000 under the June 2024 Note, which was outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 

Results
of Operations 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have not commenced any operations. All activity through September 30, 2024 relates to our formation, the Initial
Public Offering, and our search for an initial Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion
of a Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived
from the Initial Public Offering placed in the Trust Account. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 35,034, which consisted of interest earned on investments held in
the Trust Account of 238,177, offset by general and administrative expenses of 203,143. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 792,407, which consisted of interest earned on investments held in
the Trust Account of 1,718,819, offset by general and administrative expenses of 926,412. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 629,766, which consisted of interest earned on marketable securities
held in trust account of 865,387, offset by general and administrative expenses of 235,620. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 3,990,907, which consisted of interest earned on marketable securities
held in trust account of 5,258,993, offset by general and administrative expenses of 1,268,085. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources; Going Concern Consideration 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 15,539 and a working capital deficit of 5,554,762. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company has until up to March 3, 2026 to consummate a Business Combination or liquidate,
provided that we cause to be deposited the New Contributions in connection with each monthly extension of the Combination Period. It
is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated
by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation of the Trust Account and potential subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management
has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent
dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made
to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after the end of the Combination Period
(up to March 3, 2026, if we, with shareholder approval, elect to further extend the Combination Period monthly to such deadline). Based
on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will not have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity from the Sponsor
or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors to meet its needs through the earlier of the
consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this report. However, the Working Capital Loans and the June 2024 Note will provide
additional flexibility to continue our identification and pursuit of potential Business Combination targets. Over this time period, the
Company will be using available funds, including those from the Working Capital Loans, for the purpose of paying existing accounts payable,
identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses,
paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating
the Business Combination.

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do
not participate in transactions that create relationships with entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into
any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities,
or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

Other
than the Contribution Notes and June 2024 Note previously disclosed in this Quarterly Report, we do not have any long-term debt, capital
lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. The underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting commissions
of 0.35 per Unit, or 8,105,480 from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters
from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely if we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements
for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply
with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing
to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards
on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As such, our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

Additionally,
we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions
we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal control over
financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required
of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement
that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation
related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of executive compensation to median
employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering
or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of the unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited
condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The only item that involves
critical accounting estimates is value of conversion feature of the Company s promissory notes. 

Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of
a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, which management
considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual
results could differ significantly from those estimates. 

Ordinary
Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 

We
account for our ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability
instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption
rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within
our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. Our
ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain
future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders 
deficit section of our balance sheets of the financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

21 

Warrant
Instruments 

We
account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments 
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC
815 ). The assessment considers whether the instruments are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition
of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the instruments meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815,
including whether the instruments are indexed to a company s ordinary shares and whether the instrument holders could potentially
require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of a company s control, among other conditions for equity classification.
This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent
quarterly period end date while the instruments are outstanding. Upon review of the warrant agreement, the Company s management
concluded that the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants issued pursuant to such warrant agreement qualify for equity accounting
treatment.

1A. RISK FACTORS 

Factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our Annual
Report. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report. 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

On
March 3, 2022, the Company consummated the sale of 20,000,000 Units in our Initial Public Offering. On March 4, 2022 the underwriters
of the Initial Public Offering partially exercised their over-allotment option and, in connection therewith, on March 8, 2022 the Company
consummated the issuance and sale of an additional 2,009,963 Units in our Initial Public Offering. The Units were sold at a price of
 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds at the time of the Initial Public Offering of 220,099,630. The securities sold in our Initial
Public Offering were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-262246). The SEC declared
the registration statement effective on February 28, 2022. 

Offering
costs for the Initial Public Offering and the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option amounted to 10,718,994, consisting
of 4,000,000 of underwriting fees, net of 2,200,996 reimbursed from the underwriters, 8,105,480 of deferred underwriting fees payable
(which are held in the Trust Account) and 814,510 of other costs. The 8,105,480 of deferred underwriting fee payable is contingent
upon the consummation of a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

On
October 4, 2021, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,750,000 Founder Shares, for an aggregate offering price of 25,000 at an average
purchase price of approximately 0.0043 per share (up to 750,000 shares of which were subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to
which the underwriters over-allotment option was exercised). The number of Founder Shares issued was determined based on the expectation
that the Founder Shares would represent 20 of the outstanding ordinary shares upon completion of the Initial Public Offering. Such securities
were issued in connection with our organization pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act. Our Sponsor is an accredited investor for purposes of Rule 501 of Regulation D. As of April 14, 2022, the underwriters over-allotment
option expired, and therefore, the 247,510 remaining Class B ordinary shares subject to forfeiture were forfeited, resulting in the Sponsor
and Valuence Partners LP holding an aggregate of 5,502,490 Founder Shares. 

In
addition, our Sponsor, together with Valuence Partners LP, one of its affiliates, pursuant to a written agreement, purchased from us
an aggregate of 6,666,667 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.50 per warrant. This purchase took place on a private placement
basis simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Public Offering. This issuance was made pursuant to the exemption from registration
contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

No
underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales of Founder Shares or Private Placement Warrants. 

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants, an aggregate of 226,702,619 10.30 per Unit) from
the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the Trust Account. 

Our
Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, and our Articles provide, that we will have until up to March 3, 2026 to complete our Business
Combination, provided that we cause to be deposited the New Contributions in connection with each monthly extension of the Combination
Period. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination by up to March 3, 2026, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the
purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares,
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up
to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares,
which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further
liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption,
subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no
redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination within
the Combination Period. 

As
of September 30, 2024, after giving effect to our Initial Public Offering and our operations subsequent thereto, including the monthly
Contributions and New Contributions made to the Trust Account, approximately 21.9 million was held in the Trust Account.
