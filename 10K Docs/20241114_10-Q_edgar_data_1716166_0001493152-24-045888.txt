CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report contains forward-looking statements (as defined in Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that reflect our current
expectations and views of future events. The forward-looking statements are contained principally in the section entitled Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Readers are cautioned that known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors, including those over which we may have no control and others listed in this Report and our other public
filings, may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements. 

You
can identify some of these forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as may, hope, will, 
 expect, anticipate, aim, estimate, intend, plan, 
 believe, is/are likely to, potential, continue or other similar expressions.
We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events that we believe
may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements include
statements relating to: 

our
 ability to continue to refine and execute our business plan, including the recruitment of dentists to enroll in our Vivos Integrated
 Practice VIP program and utilize The Vivos Method; 

our
 ability to establish and grow our new marketing and distribution model where we create contractual alliances with operators of multiple
 sleep testing and treatment centers as a means of driving sales of our appliances; 

the
 understanding and adoption by dentists and other healthcare professionals of The Vivos Method, including our proprietary oral appliances,
 as a treatment for dentofacial abnormalities and/or mild to severe obstructive sleep apnea OSA and snoring in adults
 and moderate to severe OSA and snoring in children; 

our
 expectations concerning the effectiveness of treatment using The Vivos Method and patient relapse after completion of treatment; 

the
 potential financial benefits to VIP dentists from treating patients with The Vivos Method; 

our
 potential revenues and profit margin from the enrollment of VIPs, VIP service fees, sales of The Vivos Method treatments and appliances,
 leases of SleepImage home sleep testing rings and from our strategic alliance marketing and distribution model; 

our
 ability to properly train VIPs in the use of The Vivos Method inclusive of the services we offer independent dentists for use in
 treating their patients in their dental practices; 

our
 ability to formulate, implement and modify as necessary effective sales, marketing and strategic initiatives to drive revenue growth
 including, for example, our new strategic alliance marketing and distribution model, our Medical Integration Division, SleepImage 
 home sleep apnea test, arrangements with durable medical equipment companies DMEs and other third-party collaborations; 

the
 viability of our current intellectual property and intellectual property created in the future; 

acceptance
 by the marketplace of the products and services that we market; 

government
 regulations and our ability to obtain applicable regulatory approvals and comply with government regulations including under healthcare
 laws and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and non-U.S. equivalent regulatory
 bodies as well as laws, rules and regulations related to the practice of medicine or dentistry; 

our
 ability to retain key employees; 

adverse
 changes in general market conditions for medical devices and the products and services we offer; 

our
 ability to generate cash flow and profitability and continue as a going concern; 

our
 future financing plans; and 

our
 ability to adapt to changes in market conditions (including as a result of outbreaks of disease such as COVID-19, inflation and volatile
 geopolitical and capital markets) which could impair our operations, financial performance and ability to raise new capital. 

These
forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that our expectations expressed in these forward-looking
statements are reasonable, our expectations may later be found to be incorrect. Our actual results of operations or the results of other
matters that we anticipate herein could be materially different from our expectations. Important risks and factors that could cause our
actual results to be materially different from our expectations are generally set forth in Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and other sections in this Report as well as the Risk
Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and our other public filings. You
should thoroughly read this Report and the documents that we refer to with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially
different from and worse than what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 

The
forward-looking statements made in this Report relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in
this Report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence
of unanticipated events. You should read this Report and the documents that we refer to in this Report and have filed as exhibits to
this Report and our other public filings, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different
from what we expect.

VIVOS
THERAPEUTICS INC. 

 Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

par value per share, of Vivos Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
October 25, 2023, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of (the Reverse
Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock Split, which was approved by the Company s Board of Directors under authority granted by
the Company s stockholders at the Company s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on September 22, 2023, was consummated
pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on October 25, 2023 (the Certificate of Amendment ).
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in the accompanying financial statements, these footnotes to the financial statements
in general to shares of the Company s common stock, including prices per share of the common stock, reflect the Reverse Stock Split.
Fractional shares were not issued, and the final number of shares were rounded up to the next whole share. 

The
Company s flagship CARE program, which is part of The Vivos Method, features the Company s patented DNA, mRNA and mmRNA appliances,
which are also FDA 510(k) cleared for mild-to-severe OSA and snoring in adults. The Vivos Method may also include adjunctive myofunctional,
chiropractic/physical therapy, and laser treatments that, when properly used with the CARE appliances, constitute a powerful non-invasive
and cost-effective means of reducing or eliminating OSA symptoms. In a small subset of a study, the data has actually shown that The
Vivos Method can reverse OSA symptoms in a large portion (up to of patients. The primary competitive advantage of The Vivos Method
over other OSA therapies is that The Vivos Method s typical course of treatment is limited in most cases to 12 to 15 months, and
it is possible not to need lifetime intervention, unlike CPAP and neuro-stimulation implants. Additionally, out of over 47,000 patients
treated to date worldwide with the Company s entire current suite of products, there have been very few instances of relapse. 

The
Company also offers a suite of diagnostic and support products and services to dental and medical providers and distributors who treat
patients with OSA or related conditions. Such products and services include (i) VivoScore home sleep screenings and tests (powered by
SleepImage technology), (ii) AireO2 (an electronic health record program designed specifically for use by dentists treating
sleep patients), (iii) Treatment Navigator (a concierge service to assist a provider in educating and supporting the doctors as they
navigate insurance coverage, diagnostic indications and treatment options), (iv) Billing Intelligence Services BIS (which
optimizes medical and dental reimbursement), (v) advanced training and continuing education courses at the Company s Vivos Institute
in Denver, Colorado, (vi) MyoCorrect, a service through which Vivos-trained providers can provide orofacial myofunctional therapy OMT to patients via a telemedicine platform, and (vii) the Company s Medical Integration Division MID ), which manages
independent medical practices under management and development agreements which pays the Company from six to eight percent
of all net revenue from sleep-related services as well as development fees. 

Another
aspect of the Company s business model is to teach, train, and support dentists, medical doctors, and distributors in the use of
the Company s products and services. Dentists who use the Company s products and services typically enroll in a variety of
live or online training and educational programs offered through the Company s Vivos Institute an 18,000 sq. ft. facility
located near the Denver International Airport. Dentists are able to select the specific program or clinical pathway that they want to
focus on, such as Guided Growth and Development or Lifeline or both. Dentists may also enroll in the VIP program for the complete set
training, educational, and support services available in all three clinical pathway programs. Dentists enrolled in the VIP Program are
referred to as VIPs. The Company charges upfront enrollment fees to educate and train new providers. The Company also charges
for the ancillary support services listed above and views each product and service as a revenue/profit center. 

Further, in an effort to expand its potential for revenue generation, in
June 2024, the
Company entered into a strategic marketing and distribution alliance with an operator of multiple sleep testing and treatment
centers in Colorado, under which each party s products and services will be offered together as a comprehensive solution to OSA
patients seeking obstructive sleep apnea treatment. Under this model, the Company will invoice patients (rather than dentists), for treatment
by Vivos employed dentists. The Company anticipates this will be the first of a series of similar alliances across the country, marking
an important pivot in the Company s marketing and distribution model for treating patients and distributing its cutting edge OSA
appliances. 

The
Company believes that the disclosures provided herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading when these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements are read in conjunction with the December 31, 2023 audited consolidated financial statements
contained in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March
28, 2024. 

Service
Revenue 

VIP
Enrollment Revenue 

The
Company reviews its VIP enrollment contracts from a revenue recognition perspective using the 5-step method outlined above. All program
enrollees, irrespective of their level of enrollment, are commonly referred to as VIPs, unless it is necessary to specify their particular
program. Once it is determined that a contract exists (i.e., a VIP enrollment agreement is executed and payment is received), service
revenue related to VIP enrollments is recognized when the underlying services are performed. The price of the Premier VIP enrollment
that the VIP pays upon execution of the contract is significant, running at approximately , with different entry levels for the
various programs described above. Unearned revenue reported on the balance sheet as contract liability represents the portion of fees
paid by VIP customers for services that have not yet been performed as of the reporting date and are recorded as the service is rendered.
The Company recognizes this revenue as performance obligations are met. Accordingly, the contract liability for unearned revenue is a
significant liability for the Company. Provisions for discounts are provided in the same period that the related revenue from the products
and/or services is recorded. 

The
Company enters into programs that may provide for multiple performance obligations. Commencing in 2018, the Company began enrolling medical
and dental professionals in a one-year program (now known as the Premier VIP Program) which includes training in a highly personalized,
deep immersion workshop format which provides the Premier VIP dentist access to a team who is dedicated to creating a successful integrated
practice. 

VIP
enrollment fees include multiple performance obligations which vary on a contract-by-contract basis. The performance obligations included
with enrollments may include sleep apnea rings, a six or twelve month BIS subscription, a marketing package, lab credits and the right
to sell our appliances. The Company allocates the transaction price of a VIP enrollment contract to each performance obligation under
such contract using the relative standalone selling price method. The relative standalone price method is based on the proportion of
the standalone selling price of each performance obligation to the sum of the total standalone selling prices of all the performance
obligations in the contract. 

The
right to sell is similar to a license of intellectual property because without it the VIP cannot purchase appliances from the Company.
The right to sell performance obligation includes the Vivos training and enrollment materials which prepare dentists for treating their
patients using The Vivos Method. 

Because
the right to sell is never sold outside of VIP contracts, and VIP contracts are sold for varying prices, the Company believes that it
is appropriate to estimate the standalone selling price of this performance obligation using the residual method. As such, the observable
prices of other performance obligations under a VIP contract will be deducted from the contract price, with the residual being allocated
to the right to sell performance obligation. 

The
Company uses significant judgements in revenue recognition including an estimation of customer life over which it recognizes the right
to sell. The Company has determined that Premier VIPs who do not complete sessions 1 and 2 of training rarely complete training at all
and fail to participate in the Premier VIP program long term. Since the beginning of the Premier VIP program, just under one-third of
new VIP members fall into this category, and the revenue allocated to the right to sell for those VIPs is accelerated at the time in
which it becomes remote that a VIP will continue in the program. Revenue is recognized in accordance with each individual performance
obligation unless it becomes remote the VIP will continue, at which time the remainder of revenue is accelerated and recognized in the
following month. Those VIPs who complete training typically remain active for a much longer period, and revenue from the right to sell
for those VIPs is recognized over the estimated period of which those VIPs will remain active. Because of various factors occurring year
to year, the Company has estimated customer life for each year a contract is initiated. The estimated customer lives are calculated separately
for each year and have been estimated at 15 months for 2020, 14 months for 2021, 18 months for 2022, 23 months for 2023, and 27 months
in 2024, as a result of customers staying active for longer periods of time. The right to sell is recognized on a sum of the years 
digits method over the estimated customer life for each year as this approximates the rate of decline in VIPs purchasing behaviors we
have observed. 

Other
Service Revenue 

In
addition to VIP enrollment service revenue, in 2020 the Company launched BIS, an additional service on a monthly subscription basis,
which includes the Company s AireO2 medical billing and practice management software. Revenue for these services is recognized
monthly during the month the services are rendered. 

The
Company also offers its VIPs the ability to provide MyoCorrect to the VIP s patients as part of treatment with The Vivos Method.
The program includes packages of treatment sessions that are sold to the VIPs and resold to their patients. Revenue for MyoCorrect services
is recognized over the 12-month performance period as therapy sessions occur. 

Allocation
of Revenue to Performance Obligations 

The
Company identifies all goods and services that are delivered separately under a sales arrangement and allocates revenue to each performance
obligation based on relative fair values. These fair values approximate the prices for the relevant performance obligation that would
be charged if those services were sold separately, and are recognized over the relevant service period of each performance obligation.
After allocation to the performance obligations, any remainder is allocated to the right to sell under the residual method and is recognized
over the estimated customer life. In general, revenues are separated between durable medical equipment (product revenue) and education
and training services (service revenue). 

Treatment
of Discounts and Promotions 

From
time to time, the Company offers various discounts to its customers. These include the following: 

1) 
 Discount
 for cash paid in full 

2)

The
amount of the discount is determined up front prior to the sale. Accordingly, measurement is determined before the sale occurs and revenue
is recognized based on the terms agreed upon between the Company and the customer over the performance period. In rare circumstances,
a discount has been given after the sale during a conference which is offering a discount to full price. In this situation, revenue is
measured and the change in transaction price is allocated over the remaining performance obligation. 

The
amount of consideration can vary by customer due to promotions and discounts authorized to incentivize a sale. Prior to the sale, the
customer and the Company agree upon the amount of consideration that the customer will pay in exchange for the services the Company provides.
The net consideration that the customer has agreed to pay is the expected value that is recognized as revenue over the service period.
At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the transaction price to represent the circumstances present at the end of the
reporting period and any changes in circumstances during the reporting period. 

Product
Revenue 

In
addition to revenue from services, the Company also generates revenue from the sale of its line of oral devices and preformed guides
(known as appliances or systems) to its customers, the VIP dentists or OSA patients. These include the DNA appliance ,
mRNA appliance , the mmRNA appliance, the Versa, the Vida, the Vida Sleep and others. The Company expanded its product
offerings in the first quarter of 2023 via the acquisition of certain U.S. and international patents, product rights, and other miscellaneous
intellectual property from Advanced Facialdontics, LLC, a New York limited liability company AFD ). Revenue from appliance
sales is recognized when the control of a product is transferred to the VIP in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to
be entitled to in exchange for those products. The VIP in turn charges the VIP s patient and or patient s insurance a fee
for the appliance and for his or her professional services in measuring, fitting, and installing the appliance and educating the patient
as to its use. The Company contracts with VIPs for the sale of the appliance and is not involved in the sale of the products and services
from the VIP to the VIP s patient. 

The
Company s appliances are similar to a retainer that is worn in the mouth after braces are removed. Each appliance is unique
and is fitted to the patient. The Company utilizes its network of certified VIPs throughout the United States and in some non-U.S.
jurisdictions (notably Canada and Australia) to sell the appliances to their customers as well as in two dental centers that the
Company operates. The Company utilizes third party contract manufacturers or labs to produce its patient-customized, patented
appliances and its preformed guides. The manufacturer designated by the Company produces the appliance in strict adherence to the
Company s patents, design files, treatments, processes and procedures and under the direction and specific instruction of the
Company, ships the appliance to the VIP who ordered the appliance from the Company. All of the Company s contract
manufacturers are required to follow the Company s master design files in production of appliances or the lab will be in
violation of the FDA s rules and regulations. The Company performed an analysis and concluded it is the principal in the
transaction since it has control of the product and is reporting revenue gross. The Company bills the VIP the contracted price for
the appliance which is recorded as product revenue. Product revenue is recognized once the appliance ships to the VIP under the
direction of the Company. 

In
support of the VIPs using the Company s appliances for their patients, the Company utilizes a team of trained technicians to measure,
order and fit each appliance. Revenue is recognized differently for Company owned centers and distribution alliances with third party
sleep centers than it does for revenue from VIPs. Upon scheduling the patient (which is the Company s customer in this case), the
center takes a deposit and reviews the patient s insurance coverage. The Company recognizes revenue in the centers after the appliance
is received from the manufacturer and once the appliance is fitted and provided to the patient. 

The
Company offers certain dentists (known as Clinical Advisors) discounts to standard VIP pricing. This is done to help encourage Clinical
Advisors, who help the VIPs with technical aspects of the Company s products, to purchase Company products for their own practices.
In addition, from time to time, the Company offers credits to incentivize VIPs to adopt the Company s products and increase case
volume within their practices. These incentives are recorded as a liability at issuance and are deducted from the related product sale
at the time the credit is used.

According
to the Internal Revenue Service IRS Notice 2021-20, Guidance on the Employee Retention Credit under Section 2301
of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the period during which there is a significant decline in gross receipts
is determined by identifying the first quarter in 2020 in which the gross receipts are less than of its gross receipts for the same
period in 2019. The employee retention credit is available only to eligible employers. Section 2301(c)(2)(A) of the CARES Act defines
the term eligible employer as any employer carrying on a trade or business during calendar year 2020, and, with respect
to any calendar quarter, for which (1) the operation of the trade or business carried on during calendar year 2020 is fully or partially
suspended due to orders from an appropriate governmental authority limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings (for commercial, social,
religious, or other purposes) due to COVID-19, or (2) such calendar quarter is within the period in which the employer had a significant
decline in gross receipts, as described in section 2301(c)(2)(B) of the CARES Act. VIP dentists and potential VIPs were forced to close
their offices during 2020 as a result of COVID-19. Therefore, the Company qualifies as an eligible employer under this under the CARES
Act. 

Section
2301(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the CARES Act also provides that if an eligible employer averaged 100 or fewer employees in 2019 (a small
eligible employer ), qualified wages are those wages paid by the eligible employer with respect to an employee during any period
described in section 2301(c)(2)(A)(ii)(I) of the CARES Act (relating to a calendar quarter for which the operation of a trade or business
is fully or partially suspended due to a governmental order) or during a calendar quarter within the period described in section 2301(c)(2)(A)(ii)(II)
of the CARES Act (relating to a significant decline in gross receipts). The Company averaged fewer than 80 employees in 2019 and is therefore
considered a small eligible employer under the CARES Act. 

For
2021, the ERTC was of the first ten thousand qualified wages paid per employee each quarter. Accordingly, the credit was limited
to approximately million. As there is no authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP on accounting for government assistance to for-profit
business entities, the Company accounted for the ERTC by analogy to ASC 450, Contingencies . Accordingly, under ASC 450, entities
would treat the ERTCs (whether received in cash or as an offset to current or future payroll taxes) as if they were gain contingencies.
When applying ASC 450-30, entities would not consider the probability of complying with the terms of the ERC program but, rather, would
defer any recognition in the income statement until all uncertainties are resolved and the income is realized or realizable 
(i.e., upon receipt of the funds or formal notice by the IRS that the company is entitled to such funds). In our case, the Company elected
to follow a more conservative approach and instead of recognizing a receivable for amounts to be received when the amended tax forms
were filed in 2022, it was decided to wait for the notice from IRS and cash was received. As for financial statement presentation, it
is believed that either classifying the amounts as a reduction to payroll tax expense (expense off-set is however contrary to U.S. GAAP)
or as other income to be acceptable with appropriate disclosure of the election made by the company. However, the IRS issued a renewed
warning regarding the ERTC on March 7, 2023 urging taxpayers to carefully review the ERTC guidelines. The Company continues to evaluate
additional information from the IRS, and elected to disclose the funds received as a separate line item under long-term liabilities on
the balance sheet, until more information becomes available from the IRS. As a result, as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023,
approximately million is reflected under long-term liabilities. 

The
Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 

In
November 2, 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses ASU 2024-03 ). The
standard s purpose is to improve the disclosures about a public business entity s expenses and address requests from
investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation,
amortization, and depletion) in commonly presented expense captions (such as cost of sales, SG A, and research and development). 
Public companies will be required to disclose in the notes to financial statements specified information about certain costs and expenses
at each interim and annual reporting period. Specifically, they will be required to: 

1. Disclose
 the amounts of (a) purchases of inventory; (b) employee compensation; (c) depreciation; (d)
 intangible asset amortization; and (e) depreciation, depletion, and amortization recognized
 as part of oil- and gas-producing activities (or other amounts of depletion expense) included
 in each relevant expense caption. 
 
 2. Include
 certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under current generally accepted
 accounting principles (GAAP) in the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements. 
 
 3. Disclose
 a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are
 not separately disaggregated quantitatively. 
 
 4. Disclose
 the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity s
 definition of selling expenses. 

The
amendments in the ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on our consolidated
financial statements and disclosures. 

We
have reviewed and considered all other recent accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted and believe there are none that
could potentially have a material impact on our business practices, financial condition, results of operations, or disclosures. 

and million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of September
30, 2024. 

Net
cash used in operating activities amounted to approximately and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total liabilities of approximately million. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents, which will not be sufficient to fund
operations and strategic objectives over the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of these financial statements. Without
additional financing, these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Until
a state of cash flow positivity is reached, management is reviewing all options to obtain additional financing to fund operations. This
financing is expected to come primarily from the issuance of equity securities in order to sustain operations until the Company can achieve
profitability and positive cash flows, if ever. There can be no assurances, however, that adequate additional funding will be available
on favorable terms, or at all. If such funds are not available in the future, the Company may be required to delay, significantly modify
or terminate some or all of its operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its stockholders. 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable regulations of the SEC, that are reasonably likely
to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.

Common
Stock Transactions During the Periods Presented 

On
January 9, 2023, the Company closed a private placement (the January 2023 Private Placement pursuant to which the Company
agreed to issue and sell shares of Common Stock, Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of Common
Stock and Common Stock Purchase Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of Common Stock for net proceeds of approximately
 million. Issuance costs associated with the January 2023 Private Placement were approximately million. 

On
February 28, 2023, the Company acquired certain U.S. and international patents, patent applications, trademarks, product rights, and
other miscellaneous intellectual property from AFD. Pursuant to the asset acquisition, the Company agreed to issue shares of Common
Stock in addition to cash consideration of . As a result of this transaction the Company recorded intangible assets of approximately
 million. As part of the associated Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to a future earnout payment consideration based
on a sliding-scale percentage on the volume of future sales, as well as a cash payment of million upon the achievement of specified
milestones. Per the Company s accounting policy, the contingent consideration obligation will be recorded as the contingency is
resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable. 

In
addition, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Scott Simonetti, DDS, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of
AFD, as part-time Senior Director of Research and Development for an annual salary of approximately million and a five-year warrant
to purchase up to shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of per share; provided, however, that the shares of Common
Stock underlying such warrant are subject to vesting only upon the achievement of specified milestones related to new FDA authorizations
for the intangible assets acquired. 

As
disclosed above, on October 25, 2023 (the Effective Date ), the Company effected a Reverse Stock Split of its outstanding
shares of common stock at a ratio of . As of the Effective Date, every twenty-five shares of the Company s issued and outstanding
Common Stock was combined into one share of Common Stock. As a result, the Company s issued and outstanding Common Stock on the
Effective Date was proportionally reduced from approximately shares to approximately shares. The ownership percentage
of each of the Company s stockholders remained unchanged, other than as a result of fractional shares. No fractional shares of
Common Stock were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and stockholders that would hold a fractional share of Common Stock
as a result of the Reverse Stock Split had such fractional shares of Common Stock rounded up to the nearest whole share of Common Stock.
The number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Company s equity incentive plans and the Common Stock issuable
pursuant to outstanding equity awards and common stock purchase warrants immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were proportionately
adjusted by the ratio of the Reverse Stock Split. The exercise prices of such outstanding options and warrants were also adjusted in
accordance with their respective terms. The number of authorized shares of common stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. 

On
November 2, 2023, the Company closed a private placement (the November 2023 Private Placement with an institutional investor
pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of million of securities in a private placement consisting of (i) shares

 pre-funded warrants were exercised. 

On
February 14, 2024, the Company entered into a warrant inducement letter agreement (the Inducement Agreement with the same
institutional investor in the November 2023 Private Placement pursuant to which the investor agreed to exercise for cash the entirety

shares of Common Stock for issuance under the 2017 Plan. 

In
April 2019, the Company s shareholders approved the adoption of a stock and option award plan (the 2019 Plan ), under
which shares were reserved for future issuance for Common Stock options, restricted stock awards and other equity awards. The 2019 Plan
permits grants of equity awards to employees, directors, consultants and other independent contractors. The Company s shareholders
originally approved a total reserve of shares of Common Stock for issuance under the 2019 Plan. At each of the Company s
annual meeting of stockholders held in 2020 and 2021, the Company s stockholders approved amendments to the 2019 Plan to increase
the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance thereunder by an aggregate of shares of Common Stock such that, after
such amendments, and prior to any grants, shares of Common Stock were available for issuance. 

On
September 22, 2023, stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s 2019 Plan to increase the number of shares of Company common

A full valuation allowance was in effect, which resulted in the Company s zero tax expense. 

Management
assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing
deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred since inception. Such
objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as the Company s projections for future growth.
On the basis of this evaluation, a full valuation allowance has been recorded at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to record the
deferred tax asset that is not likely to be realized. 

The
computation of the annual estimated effective tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and significant judgement including,
but not limited to, the expected operating income for the year, projections of the proportion of income earned and taxed in various jurisdictions,
permanent and temporary differences, and the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets generated in the current year. The accounting
estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is obtained, additional information
becomes known or as the tax environment changes. 

If
an economic recession or depression commences and is sustained, it could have a material adverse effect on our business as demand for
our products could decrease. To date, the Company has been able to manage inflation risk without a material adverse impact on its business
or results of operations. However, inflationary pressures (including increases in the price of raw material components of the Company s
appliances) made it necessary for the Company to adjust its standard pricing for its appliance products effective May 1, 2022, and we
may have to do so again in 2024. The full impact of such price adjustments on sales or demand for the Company s products is not
fully known at this time and may require the Company to adjust other aspects of its business as it seeks to grow revenue and, ultimately,
achieve profitability and positive cash flow from operations. 

An additional inflation-related
risk is the Federal Reserve s response, which included significant increases, and more recently decreases, in interest rates. Such
actions have, in times past, created unintended consequences in terms of the impact on housing starts, overall manufacturing, capital
markets, and banking. If such disruptions become systemic, like in the recession of 2008, then the impact on the Company s revenue,
earnings potential and access to capital of both inflation and inflation-fighting responses would be impossible to know or calculate. 

These
conditions could cause an economic recession or depression to commence, and if such recession or depression is sustained, it could have
a material adverse effect on the Company s business as demand for its products could decrease. Such conditions have also had, and
may continue to have, an adverse effect on the capital markets, with public stock price decreases and volatility, which could make it
more difficult for the Company to raise needed capital at the appropriate time.

Common stock options 

Total 

As
of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
and other accrued liabilities approximated their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 

As
discussed in Note 8, on January 9, 2023, the Company closed on a Private Placement for the sale by the Company of shares of the Company s
common stock and the issuance of pre-funded warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock at an exercise price
of per share, and the issuance of warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock at an exercise price
of per share. The warrants are initially exercisable commencing January 9, 2023 through their expiration date of July 9, 2028. 

On
November 2, 2023, the Company closed a private placement (the November 2023 Private Placement with an institutional investor
pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of million of securities in a private placement consisting of (i) shares
of Common Stock, (ii) a pre-funded warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of per share, (iii)
a five-year Series A Common Stock Purchase Warrant to purchase up to shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of per
share and (iii) an 18-month Series B Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the Series B Warrant to purchase up to shares
of Common Stock with an exercise price of per share. Issuance costs associated with the November 2023 Private Placement were approximately
 million. 

In
addition, as part of the November 2023 Private Placement, we agreed to amend the existing outstanding common stock purchase warrant held
by the purchaser and issued in January 2023 to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of
 per share with an expiration date of . Such amendment, which became effective upon the closing of the November 2023
Private Placement, reduced the exercise price of the January warrant to per share and extended the expiration date of such warrant
to . The amendment also restated in its entirety the definition of Black Scholes Value contained in the
January warrant which resulted in the classification of the warrant from liability to equity. The liability associated with those warrants
was initially recorded at fair value in the Company s consolidated balance sheet upon issuance, and subsequently re-measured as
of March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, and November 2, 2023 when the November 2023 Private Placement closed. The changes
in the fair value between issuance, the March 31, 2023 measurement date, the June 30, 2023 measurement date, the September 30, 2023,
and the November 2, 2023 measurement date are recorded as a component of other income (expense), in the consolidated statement of operations. 

Recurring
Fair Value Measurements 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any assets and liabilities classified as Level 1, Level
2 or Level 3. The Company concluded that the warrants issued in connection with the private placement, met the definition of a liability
under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and classified the liability as Level 3. For the nine months ended September
30, 2023, the Company did not have any assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 or Level 2, and had a warranty liability measured
at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) of approximately million. 

The
Company s policy is to recognize asset or liability transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 as of the actual date of the events
or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 the Company
had no transfers of its assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy. 

Significant
Concentrations 

Credit
Risk 

Financial
instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents on
deposit with financial institutions, the balances of which frequently exceed federally insured limits. Management monitors the soundness
of these financial institutions and believes the Company s risk is negligible. The Company has not experienced any losses in such
accounts. If any of the financial institutions with whom the Company does business was to be placed into receivership, the Company may
be unable to access the cash they have on deposit with such institutions. If the Company were unable to access cash and cash equivalents
as needed, the financial position and ability to operate the business could be adversely affected. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
had cash and cash equivalents with three financial institutions in the United States with an aggregate balance of million. 

Generally,
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company s customer
base and their dispersion across different geographies and industries. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations on certain customers
and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. No single customer represented more than 10 of our accounts receivable
as of September 30, 2024. The Company maintains reserves for potential bad debts. 

Supplier
Concentration 

As
previously disclosed, the Company relies on third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers for the raw materials and components used
in our appliances and to manufacture and assemble our products. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had five suppliers that accounted
for approximately 80 of the Company s total purchases during the year. The Company expects to maintain existing relationships
with these vendors.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial
statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical
financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and
assumptions. Some of the numbers included herein have been rounded for the convenience of presentation. Our actual results may differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. See Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements. 

Overview 

We
are a revenue stage medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative treatment alternatives
for patients with dentofacial abnormalities and/or patients diagnosed with mild to severe obstructive sleep apnea OSA and snoring in adults. We believe our technologies and conventions represent a significant improvement in the treatment of mild to severe
OSA versus other treatments such as continuous positive airway pressure CPAP or palliative oral appliance therapies.
Our alternative treatments are part of The Vivos Method . 

The
Vivos Method is an advanced therapeutic protocol, which often combines the use of customized oral appliance specifications and proprietary
clinical treatments developed by our company and prescribed by specially trained dentists in cooperation with their medical colleagues.
Published studies have shown that using our customized appliances and clinical treatments led to significantly lower Apnea Hypopnea Index
scores and have improved other conditions associated with OSA. Over 47,000 patients have been treated to date, worldwide, with our entire
current suite of products by more than 2,000 trained dentists. 

Our
business model is focused around dentists, and our program to train independent dentists and offer them other value-added services in
connection with their ordering and use of The Vivos Method for patients is called the Vivos Integrated Practice VIP program. 

Strategic
Alliance Agreement . We have historically sought to generate revenues based on enrollments of dentists in our VIP program and sales
of Vivos Method appliances and devices and services to our VIPs. In June 2024, we announced an important pivot in the way we market and
distribute our Vivos Method appliances and devices. This new strategy is seeking to drive revenue by entering into contractual alliances
with dentists, sleep center operators and other healthcare providers. 

31 

This
strategy pivot was accompanied by a 7.5 million equity growth investment V-CO Investors LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company V-CO ),
which is an affiliate of New Seneca Partners, Inc. Seneca ), a leading North American private equity sponsor based in Southfield,
Michigan. This investment materially bolstered our cash on hand and stockholders equity and has facilitated the launch of the
new strategic alliance described below. We hope this will lead to other similar alliances, which would positively impact our revenue
growth. 

On
June 12, 2024, VSI Providers, PLLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company VSI ), and Rebis Health Holdings, LLC Rebis ),
entered into a strategic alliance agreement (the SAA providing for a joint marketing and distribution arrangement under
which each party s products and services will be offered together as a comprehensive solution to patients seeking sleep apnea treatment.
Rebis and its affiliates operate multiple sleep testing and treatment centers in Colorado. VSI has a network of licensed dental professionals
trained in providing various sleep apnea treatment-related services and, through its affiliates, access to additional products and services
related to sleep apnea treatment. The Company and V-CO are third-party beneficiaries of the SAA. Under the SAA VSI is providing Rebis
with access to licensed dental professionals trained in providing certain dental services (each a VSI Dental Provider to provide such dental services in designated practice locations (as described in the SAA); provided, that nothing in the SAA restricts
Rebis right to utilize the dental services of its own employees in a similar capacity as the VSI Dental Providers. Pursuant to
the SAA, Rebis will be entitled to receive from VSI an agreed upon percentage of patient payments collected by VSI Dental Providers,
less certain administrative fees charged by VSI and agreed to direct cost deductions. 

The
term of the SAA commences as of June 10, 2024, and continues for a period of two (2) years unless sooner terminated. At the end of the
initial term of the agreement, the SAA will automatically renew for additional one (1) year terms unless either party gives written notice
of its intent not to renew at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term. VSI and Rebis each may terminate the SAA
(subject to applicable notice and cure periods) on breaches of the SAA, bankruptcy, and similar events. The SAA contains standard covenants
regarding compliance with applicable laws, a two year non-solicitation of personnel provision, intellectual property, insurance and maintaining
the confidentiality of communications and proprietary information. The SAA also contains customary representations and warranties of
the parties, indemnification, and liability limitations. 

We
are aiming to replicate the marketing and distribution alliance memorialized by the SAA with other healthcare professionals as part of
a growing network of providers who offer The Vivos Method as an alternative treatment for mild to severe OSA. We believe this will provide
us with an important opportunity to increase our revenues going forward. 

Management
Services Agreement . Airway Integrated Management Company, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company AIM ), and V-CO entered into a management services agreement (the MSA ). The purpose of the
MSA is to create an incentive for V-CO to assist in establishing and growing our strategic alliance with Rebis. 

Pursuant
to the MSA, V-CO will provide certain management, consulting, and advisory services to the Company related to the SAA. The term of the
MSA commences on June 10, 2024, and continues until the later of (i) June 10, 2027 or (ii) such time as V-CO has received two (2) times
its original investment in the Private Placement (the MSA Term ). The MSA will automatically renew for additional terms
of one (1) year unless any party sooner terminates the agreement in accordance with the terms of the MSA. During the MSA Term, V-CO will
provide to the Company and AIM oversight, management consulting and advisory services, including, without limitation: (i) management
of general and administrative expenses of the SAA, (ii) advice on strategy of the SAA with a view towards maximizing the revenue and
profit generated by the SAA, (iii) searches for additional potential sleep center operators to form strategic alliances with, (iv) making
introductions to industry contacts of V-CO and its affiliates (including Seneca) for purposes of expanding the business and opportunities
of the Company, AIM, VSI and the SAA, and (v) performing other services as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Company,
VSI or the AIM, and agreed to by V-CO, taking into account the level of compensation for services and other engagements that V-CO and
its affiliates may have (collectively, the Management Services ). As consideration for the Management Services, AIM has
agreed to pay to V-CO for three (3) years a management fee equal to 37,500 per quarter, payable quarterly in arrears, with a minimum
of 25,000 per quarter paid in cash and the remaining up to 12,500 per quarter paid in the form of cash or restricted Common Stock,
as decided by V-CO (the Management Fee ). The value of restricted Common Stock, if any, paid as part of the Management Fee
will be calculated based upon the average 5-day closing price of the Common Stock ending as of the end of each applicable quarter (or,
if the Common Stock is not then publicly listed, as determined in good faith by the Board using industry standard valuation metrics). 

32 

In
addition to the Management Fee, V-CO will also receive a quarterly cash participation payment from AIM (the Participation Payment equal to an agreed upon percentage of the net positive cash flow (as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles) generated by the operations of the SAA and received by VSI pursuant to the SAA Net Cash Flow ). The Participation
Payment shall accrue (the Accrued Amount and not be paid until the Company on a consolidated basis is cash flow positive
from operations, as reported in its SEC filings (the Participation Trigger Event (meaning the Company shall receive all
Net Cash Flow (if any) from VSI until the occurrence of the Participation Trigger Event). The Profit Participation shall continue to
be earned quarterly until the later of such time as (i) V-CO receives an amount equal to two (2) times its investment in the Private
Placement; or (ii) or June 10, 2027. The MSA contains customary covenants regarding confidentiality and indemnification. Under the MSA,
V-CO will also assign to AIM or its affiliates V-CO s entire right, title, and interest in any intellectual property it creates
while working for or on behalf of AIM.

Note 1 to the accompanying financial statements for additional background information on our Company and current product and service
offerings. 

Impact
of COVID-19 

Our
business was materially impacted by COVID-19 in 2020 and to some extent thereafter and through the early part of 2023 due to the actions
of governmental bodies that mandated quarantines and lockdowns that resulted in many of our VIPs and potential VIPs having to close their
offices. The impact of COVID-19 on our business diminished somewhat through 2023. However, the residual effects of the pandemic on dental
workforce availability as well as patient precautionary measures continued to negatively impact our VIP dental practices and our revenue
across the U.S. and Canada during 2022 and into 2023. Thus far in 2024, we do not believe COVID-19 issues are impacting our business
in any material way. We continue to monitor the overall landscape of potential viral or other diseases which may pose a threat, and we
will respond appropriately should any such threats materialize. 

Material
Items, Trends and Risks Impacting Our Business 

We
believe that the following items and trends may be useful in better understanding our results of operations. 

Establishment
and Growth of Our New Strategic Alliance Model. We are placing significant emphasis on our new provider-based marketing and distribution
model to grow our revenues. In June 2024, we announced the execution of a strategic marketing and distribution alliance with Rebis, an
operator of multiple sleep testing and treatment centers in Colorado. This alliance, which we hope will be the first of a series of similar
alliances across the country, marks an important pivot in our marketing and distribution model for our cutting edge OSA appliances. Under
the new alliance, we are collaborating with Rebis to offer OSA patients a full spectrum of evidence-based treatments such as CPAP machines,
and our own advanced, proprietary and FDA-cleared CARE oral medical devices, oral appliances and additional adjunctive therapies and
methods. This new model differs from our current model which emphasizes a subscription-based relationship with our VIP dentists together
with sales of our OSA devices to VIPs and the provision of services to VIPs. The new marketing and distribution strategic alliance is
based on a revenue-sharing model between us and Rebis. 

We
are placing significant emphasis on establishing and growing this new model as a means of increasing our revenue. However, this new model
is unproven and we have no operating history associated with this new model. There is therefore a lack of information for you to evaluate
our future prospects utilizing this new model. Moreover, there is a material risk that this new model will not increase our revenues
or be additive to our stockholders equity in the manner we anticipate. Our inability to introduce and scale this marketing and
distribution model would materially harm our business and operating results and likely cause our stock price to suffer. 

New
VIP Enrollments (Service Revenue). Enrolling dental practices as VIPs has historically been the first step in our ability to generate
new revenue (although the growth of strategic partner model could lessen our dependence on VIP enrollments). As part of the VIP enrollment
fee, we enter into a service contract with VIPs under which they receive training on the use of the Vivos treatment modalities. VIPs
have the ability to start generating revenue for us and themselves after this training. To entice dentists to enroll as VIPs, we have
worked with different marketing programs (which we generally call a discovery track with respect to the payment of VIPs
enrollment fee, including discounts and payment plans. Once VIPs execute their VIP enrollment agreement, the discovery track allows the
VIP 45 to 60 days to obtain financing and pay the enrollment fee. Ongoing support and additional training is provided throughout the
year under the services contract, which includes access to our proprietary Airway Intelligence Services, which provides the VIP with
resources to help simplify the sleep apnea diagnostic and Vivos treatment planning process. 

33 

In
addition to enrollment service revenue, we offer additional services, such as our Billing Intelligence Services offering, and MyoCorrect
orofacial myofunctional therapy services, which was introduced in April 2021. Revenue for these services is recognized as the Company s
performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with ASC 606. 

We
are also engaging in strategic collaborations to market the benefits of the Vivos treatment modalities and VIP enrollment to dentists,
including our cooperative relationships with various medical providers to deliver diagnostic and medical consultation services to people
across North America who suffer from OSA. 

We
recognize revenue on VIP enrollments once the contract is executed, payment is received, and as the Company s performance obligations
are satisfied in accordance with ASC 606. 

Product
Sales Revenue. Throughout the latter part of 2023 and into the second quarter of 2024, the Company experienced a decline in Product
Sales Revenue. As previously noted, we believe this decline was due in part to certain adverse events in the larger sleep apnea oral
appliance market, and not specific to Vivos. Another factor contributing to the decline was our Reductions In Force (RIF) which we undertook
during 2022 and 2023. However, those product sales revenue declines began to reverse somewhat in the second quarter of 2024. Enrolling
new VIPs has historically been key to our ability to generate revenue from product sales, and lower VIP enrollments during 2023 and into
the first quarter of 2024 also dampened product sales revenue. Equally as important, however, is the number of Vivos treatment case starts
that our existing VIPs commence, as these lead to appliance orders and related revenue. Once a VIP is fully trained, we encourage them
to start cases. However, our experience has been that VIPs typically start slowly as they introduce The Vivos Method into their practices.
While we work with VIPs to screen their patients for OSA with our SleepImage home sleep apnea ring test (which we expect
will encourage Vivos Method case starts), not all VIPs incorporate our The Vivos Method into their practices at the same rate. We utilize
Practice Advisors to help VIPs with onboarding and starting and increasing case starts over time. We believe VIPs can recoup their investment
in VIP enrollment with approximately eight Vivos Method case starts, but as noted above, many VIPs start and also maintain their case
starts at a significantly slower rate. We presently have a concentration of active VIPs who regularly start new Vivos Method treatment
cases. Approximately 32 of our VIPs initiated a new case as of September 30, 2024. We are working not only to increase the number of
VIPs overall, but the number of active VIPs in terms of case starts. More active VIPs are also more likely to take advantage of our other
service revenue generating offerings such as MyoCorrect orofacial myofunctional therapy and medical Billing Intelligence Services. 

In
addition, an important aspect of our strategy to increase product revenues relates to the products and related intellectual property
we acquired in March 2023 from Advanced Facialdontics, LLC AFD ), including a custom single arch device with an FDA 510(k)
clearance for treating TMD and/or Bruxism (teeth grinding or clenching). We have rebranded the AFD products as Vivos Vida TM 
and Vivos Vida Sleep TM . During the first quarter of 2024, certain of those products were among the fastest growing segment
of our entire product line, and we expect to continue to increase sales of these acquired products throughout the remainder of 2024 and
beyond. 

Marketing
to DSOs . During the second half of 2021, we increased our efforts to market The Vivos Method and related products and services to
larger dental support organizations DSOs ). Marketing to DSOs creates an opportunity to enroll and onboard multiple dental
practices as VIPs under one common ownership structure. This allows us to leverage training and support across multiple VIP practices
and gain economies of scale with the goal of faster growth, both in VIP enrollments and in Vivos case starts. As we cautioned previously,
DSOs tend to move slowly when adopting new technologies or programs, and we do not expect DSO training or product sales to materially
impact overall revenue in 2024. Our other dentist enrollment program, which we refer to as the Airway Alliance Program AAP ),
was also established in the fourth quarter of 2021 and launched in the first quarter of 2022. This subscription program was designed
to attract the vast majority of the estimated 200,000 U.S. and Canadian dentists who are being strongly encouraged by the American Dental
Association to screen their patients for sleep apnea. The AAP program has not contributed meaningful revenue in the first nine months
of 2024. 

34 

Clinical
Trial Work . Our efforts to engage in research to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of our products and obtain additional regulatory
clearances for the use of our products is an important aspect of our overall strategy. In this regard, on May 29, 2023, we and Stanford
University executed an agreement to commence a sponsored clinical research study to evaluate the efficacy of our FDA-cleared DNA appliance
compared to the standard of care, CPAP for treatment of sleep apnea. Our DNA device is currently indicated for the treatment of mild
to severe sleep apnea and jaw repositioning in adults (and in the case of severe OSA, along with positive airway pressure (PAP) and/or
myofunctional therapy, as needed). Enrollment of 150 patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index score of 15 or
greater) will be randomly assigned to either treatment with our FDA-cleared DNA appliance or CPAP. The protocol has been finalized and
the initial start-up fees have been incurred, however, the timing of the enrollment of patients is being determined. This trial may not
meet its designated endpoints, and therefore additional FDA clearances for the DNA device may not be obtained. 

Distribution
Agreements. During 2023, we entered into distribution collaborations with third parties to expand access of our products to potential
patients. For example, the SAA with Rebis is expected to deliver our proprietary treatment options and protocols to mild to severe OSA
patients who have failed being candidates for CPAP. By collaborating with Rebis and other similar sleep clinics, we will be able to drive
top line revenue and lower customer acquisition costs and overhead. We hope that these strategic initiatives will lead to revenue growth
opportunities for us in 2024 and beyond, and our ability to capitalize on these initiatives is expected to be a material aspect of our
sales and marketing program going forward. 

On
June 1, 2023, we entered into a non-exclusive distribution agreement with Lincare, a leading supplier in the United States of respiratory
products, such as CPAP equipment. Lincare currently provides respiratory products to approximately 1.8 million patients nationwide. Pursuant
to this agreement, Lincare began to distribute certain of our products in the United States, including the Vida , VidaSleep ,
and Versa . The distribution agreement was subject to a 90-day pilot program in Colorado and Florida. Within weeks of starting the
pilot program, Lincare reported an initial 36 positive patient response to our products subject to the agreement. 

In October 2023, we announced an exclusive distribution agreement with NOUM DMCC, a Dubai-based company focused on diagnostic testing
and treatment product distribution for healthcare providers and hospital networks treating obstructive sleep apnea patients throughout
the Middle East-North Africa region. Subject to regulatory approvals, which are pending in several countries under the agreement, we
could see revenue from this collaboration in the latter part of 2024. 

Impact
on Sales from Unregistered Oral Appliance Publicity. On or about March 1, 2023, CBS News reported the tragic case of a woman with
a malocclusion and breathing problem who had received treatment via a fixed oral appliance known as the AGGA (Anterior Growth Guidance
Appliance). The AGGA is a non-FDA cleared oral appliance developed by Dr. Steve Galella, a dentist from Tennessee. According to the televised
CBS report, the device created serious issues with her dentition and jaws, resulting in the loss of several anterior teeth. The patient
filed a 10 million lawsuit against the treating dentist. 

Vivos
was not named in the lawsuit, nor was our device implicated in creating the tooth displacement and other concerns that gave rise to the
lawsuit. Vivos has never had any association or affiliation with the AGGA device or its promoters, nor has the Company ever endorsed
these kind of counterfeit fixed oral appliances that make unproven and unsubstantiated claims. 

35 

The
FDA regulates and categorizes all medical devices claiming to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and/or TMD disorders as Class II devices
and requires that they have a 510(k) clearance in order to be used with patients. The AGGA device does not have any such FDA clearance,
nor are there any known peer-reviewed and published studies validating the safety and efficacy of this device. In stark contrast, all
Vivos oral appliances are duly registered or cleared by the FDA according to strict FDA guidelines. Our appliances and attending protocols
for proper use are also backed by extensive peer reviewed published research. Moreover, Vivos appliances operate on a completely different
mechanism of action than that of the AGGA and similar devices on the market. Vivos has always maintained that such appliances tend to
create inflammation and pose other risks that are unacceptable. The AGGA is a fixed appliance, whereas Vivos appliances are removable
devices. 

Unfortunately,
and despite our best efforts to distance ourselves and our products from the AGGA device, the entire matter generated a certain amount
of confusion and fear amongst both existing VIP dentists and other non-affiliated dentist prospects. Thus, new provider enrollments and
sales of Vivos appliances in the first quarter 2023 decreased as word spread. By the latter part of June 2023, we began to see a partial
rebound in new enrollments. Nevertheless, certain Vivos-trained providers remain very cautious and are being far more selective in their
cases, which has continued to impact appliance sales through the end of 2023 and into 2024. 

Our
core product is The Vivos Method, not any one single device. We believe this is a key distinguishing factor for our approach. The Vivos
Method involves far more than just our oral appliances. It begins with proper and thorough diagnosis and ends with a customized multidisciplinary
treatment plan that likely incorporates one or more of several treatment modalities, including oral myofunctional therapy, SOT chiropractic,
physical therapy, laser therapy, nutritional counseling, CPAP, mandibular advancement, CARE device therapy, and more. The Vivos Method
is thus a fully integrated end-to-end diagnostic, training, and treatment platform that can adapt to the needs of virtually any and every
breathing disordered sleep patient. 

Inflation .
The U.S. has been experiencing a period of inflation which has increased (and may continue to increase) our and our suppliers 
costs as well as the end cost of our products to consumers. To date, we have been able to manage inflation risk without a material adverse
impact on our business or results of operations. However, inflationary pressures (including increases in the price of raw material components
of our appliances) made it necessary for us to adjust our standard pricing for our appliance products effective May 1, 2022. In addition,
future price adjustments may be required as we seek to grow revenue and, ultimately, achieve profitability and positive cash flow from
operations. 

An additional inflation-related
risk is the Federal Reserve's involvement with interest rates with recent history both increasing and decreasing interest rates in order
to manage inflation. Such actions have, in times past, created unintended consequences in terms of the impact on housing starts, overall
manufacturing, capital markets, and banking. If such disruptions become systemic, as occurred in the recession of 2008, then the impact
on our revenue, earnings and access to capital of both inflation and inflation-fighting responses would be impossible to know or calculate. 

Supply
Chain. From time to time, we may experience supply chain challenges due to forces beyond our control. For example, the Suez Canal
blockage earlier in 2021 caused some delay in shipments of SleepImage rings from China. Overall, however, as our appliances
are made in the U.S., we have not experienced significant supply chain issues as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, although this may
change in future periods. 

Seasonality .
We believe that the patient volumes of our VIPs will be sensitive to seasonal fluctuations in urgent care and primary care activity.
Typically, the fourth quarter tends to be one where we see higher enrollment levels for new VIP dentists, however, as previously mentioned
reported, in the fourth quarter of 2023 we did not see that same pattern emerge. The first and second quarters of each year tend to be
our weakest quarter of the year for new enrollments, and to a certain extent, appliance sales as well. This was the case in the first
half of 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024. Winter months see a higher occurrence of influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia and similar
illnesses; however, the timing and severity of these outbreaks vary dramatically. Additionally, as consumers shift toward high deductible
insurance plans, they are responsible for a greater percentage of their bill, particularly in the early months of the year before other
healthcare spending has occurred, which may lead to lower than expected patient volume or an increase in bad debt expense during that
period. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future depending on these and other factors. 

36 

War
in Ukraine and Middle East Hostilities. In addition, worldwide supply chain constraints and economic and capital markets
uncertainty arising out of Russia s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the attacks by Hamas on Israel in October of 2023
and Israel s responses (including recent military engagement in Lebanon and with Iran) have disrupted commercial and capital markets, and emerged as potential barriers to long-term economic recovery. If an economic
recession or depression commences and is sustained, it could have a material adverse effect on our business as demand for our
products could decrease. Capital markets uncertainty, with public stock price decreases and volatility, could make it more difficult
for us to raise capital when needed. 

Potential
Nasdaq Delisting. As previously reported, on May 16, 2024, the Company received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff
of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, as of March 31, 2024, the Company failed to comply with Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires stockholders equity of at least 2.5 million (the Equity Requirement ). On
June 25, 2024, the Company reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K that it believed it had stockholders equity of at least 2.5
million as of the date of the filing of such report as a result of the Company s closing of a 7.5 million equity private placement
on June 10, 2024. 

On
June 27, 2024, the Company met with a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel to discuss the Company s past, current, and
anticipated future compliance with the Equity Requirement, and requested the continued listing of its securities on Nasdaq. On July 5,
2024, the Company was notified that the Panel had granted the Company s request for continued listing on Nasdaq, subject to the
Company s filing of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, with the SEC by August 15, 2024, evidencing the Company s
compliance with the Equity Requirement. 

The
Company is working diligently to ensure its continued compliance with the Equity Requirement, including its 4.3 million shelf offering
in September 2024 as well as exploring potential additional equity capital financings to stay above the minimum threshold of the Equity
Requirement. The Company anticipates that its previously disclosed strategic marketing and distribution alliance will also positively
impact the Company s revenue growth and stockholders equity in upcoming fiscal quarters. However, there is a risk that the
Company will be unable to raise sufficient capital or generate sufficient revenue or operating results to maintain compliance with the
Equity Requirement. If the Company fails to achieve ongoing compliance and its common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, such delisting would
likely have a material adverse effect on the Company s stock price, the ability of its stockholders to buy or sell their common
stock, the ability of the Company to raise capital and on the Company s reputation, all of which could make it significantly more
difficult to operate the Company. 

Key
Components of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations 

Net
revenue. We recognize revenue when we satisfy our performance obligations over time as our customers receive the benefit of the
promised goods and services, which generally occurs over a short period of time. Performance obligations with respect to appliance sales
are typically satisfied by shipping or delivering products to our VIPs or, in the case of enrollment or service revenue, upon our satisfaction
of performance obligations associated with VIP enrollments. Net revenue consists of the gross sales price, net of estimated allowances, discounts,
and personal rebates that are accounted for as a reduction from the gross sale price. 

Cost
of sales. Cost of goods sold primarily consists of direct costs attributable to the purchase from third party suppliers and related
products. It also includes freight costs, fulfillment, distribution, and warehousing costs related to products sold. A prior period amount of less than 0.2 million previously classified as Loss on inventory write-down 
has been reclassified to Cost of sales in the current period s financial statements to better reflect the nature of these
transactions and to enhance the comparability of financial statemen line items across periods. 

Sales
and marketing. Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of personnel costs for employees engaged in sales and marketing activities,
commissions, advertising and marketing costs, website enhancements, and conferences for our sales and marketing staff. 

General
and administrative expenses. General and administrative G A expenses consist primarily of personnel costs
for our administrative, human resources, finance and accounting employees, and executives. General and administrative expenses also include
contract labor and consulting costs, travel - related expenses, legal, auditing and other professional fees, rent and facilities
costs, repairs and maintenance, and general corporate expenses. 

37 

Depreciation
and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense is comprised of depreciation expense related to property and
equipment, amortization expense related to leasehold improvements, and amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets. 

Other
income. Other income relates to interest income in 2024, as well as excess warrant fair value and change in fair value of warrant
liability in 2023.

Comparison
of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenue 

Revenue
increased by approximately 0.6 million, or 17 , to approximately 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024
compared to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in total revenue during the third quarter of
2024 due to an increase of approximately 0.5 million in product revenue due to higher product sales and an increase of
approximately 0.1 million in service revenue. The increase in product revenue is attributable to an increase of approximately 0.4
million in appliances sales and approximately 0.1 million in guide sales to existing VIPs. The increase in service revenue is
attributable to an increase of approximately 0.2 million in sponsorship, seminar and other service revenue, offset by a decrease of
 0.1 in VIP enrollments and Myofunctional therapy revenues. Lastly, BIS and sleep testing services revenue remained flat for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we enrolled 5 VIPs and recognized VIP enrollment revenue of approximately 0.9 million, a
decrease of approximately 6 in enrollment revenue, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, when we enrolled 29 VIPs
for a total of approximately 1.0 million in revenue. Revenue decrease in the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by a reduction in
VIP enrollments due to a change in sales strategy and focus toward sleep center affiliations, offset by a higher
incidence of breakage in contracts. This accelerated revenue recognition on several contracts for VIPs who did not complete their
training during the first 90 days of their enrollment. Approximately 0.5 million in revenue was attributable to breakage during the
three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to approximately 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30,
2023. 

38 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 1,954 oral appliance arches for a total of approximately 2.0 million, a 34 
increase in revenue from the three months ended September 30, 2023, when we sold 1,809 oral appliance arches for a total of
approximately 1.5 million. The increase in revenue is directly attributable to an 83 decrease in discounts for such appliances,
offered during the same period, with less than 0.1 million in discounts offered during the three months ended September 30, 2024
when compared to approximately 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to the section Material
Items, Trends and Risks Impacting Our Business above for events that impacted our product sales. 

Cost
of Sales and Gross Profit 

Cost
of sales remained relatively constant with a decrease of less than 0.1 million or 2 at approximately 1.5 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, compared 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily related to 0.1 million
decrease in sleep testing reporting and 0.1 million decrease in VIP training related costs, due to lower enrollments and fewer training
sessions scheduled during the period. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit increased by approximately 0.6 million to 2.3 million. This increase was attributable
to an increase in revenue of approximately 0.6 million. Gross margin increased to 60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to 53 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to the revenue increase. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses decreased approximately 0.1 million, or approximately 2 , to approximately 4.5 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of
this decrease was 0.1 million in employee compensation, including salaries and benefits, paid time off, stock-based compensation,
and other employee-related expenses, as a result of the reduction in force implemented during the second and third quarter of 2023
and 2024. Coupled with a decrease of approximately 0.1 million in travel, meals and entertainment, and a decrease of approximately
 0.1 million related to taxes, licenses and other fees. This was offset by an increase of approximately 0.2 million related to
professional fees including fees for consultants and legal services. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses decreased by approximately 0.3 million or approximately 46 , to 0.3 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024, compared to approximately 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by
lower commissions and digital media and marketing supplies. 

Depreciation
and Amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization expense was approximately 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Depreciation and amortization
decreased slightly during the period due to some assets being fully depreciated and a small amount of depreciable assets placed into
service. 

Other
Income 

Other
income of less than 0.1 million includes interest income from financial institutions. 

39 

Excess
warrant fair value and change in fair value of warrant liability, net of issuance costs 

The
liability for the warrants issued in the January 9, 2023 private placement totaled approximately 14.5 million which included 186,667
pre-funded warrants with a fair value of approximately 6.7 million and 266,667 additional common stock purchase warrants with a fair
value of approximately 7.7 million. The difference between the fair value of the 14.5 million liability-classified warrants and the
net proceeds received of approximately 8.0 million, or approximately 6.5 million, was recognized as a day-one non-operating expense.
The change in fair value of the warrant liability was 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by a decrease
of 62 in the stock price or approximately 7.95 per share during the period. The derivative warrant liability was eliminated in November
2023, and as a result, no change in fair value of warrant liability was recorded in the third quarter of 2024. 

Comparison
of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenue 

Revenue
increased approximately 0.8 million, or 7 , to approximately 11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
 10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue during the nine months of 2024 due to an increase of approximately 0.8 million in product revenue due to higher product sales. The increase in product revenue is attributable
to an increase of approximately 0.5 million in appliances sales, coupled with an increase of approximately 0.3 million in guide sales
to existing VIPs. The decrease in service revenue is attributable to a decrease of approximately 0.2 million in Myofunctional therapy
revenues followed by a decrease of approximately 0.2 million in VIP enrollment revenue. This was offset by an increase of approximately
 0.3 million in sponsorship, seminar and other service revenue, and an increase of approximately 0.1 million in sleep testing services.
BIS revenue remained unchanged for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we enrolled 87 VIPs and recognized VIP enrollment revenue of approximately 3.0 million, a
decrease of approximately 6 in enrollment revenue, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, when we enrolled 110 VIPs for
a total of approximately 3.2 million. Revenue decrease in the first nine months of 2024 was due to changes to key inputs in our revenue
recognition methodology, primarily estimated customer lives. As part of our annual process, the estimated customer lives are calculated
separately for each year and was estimated to be 27 months in 2024, an increase of 17 , compared to 23 months in 2023, and an even higher
increase of 50 when compared to 18 months in 2022. Estimated customer lives impacts the amortization of revenue to be spread over a
longer period of time, thus decreasing the revenue that is recognized over the same period when compared to 2023. Although such adjustment
to customer lives negatively impacts our revenue recognition, increasing estimated customer lives results in customers staying active
for a longer period of time, thus increasing our customer retention year-over-year. Additionally, our revenue was lowered by a sales
strategy shift and focus toward sleep center affiliations, coupled with lower enrollments late 2023 and all of 2024, which resulted in
lower service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was offset by a higher incidence of breakage in contracts, this
accelerated revenue recognition on several contracts for VIPs who did not complete their training during the first 90 days of their enrollment.
Approximately 1.5 million in revenue was attributable to breakage during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to
approximately 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 5,993 oral appliance arches for a total of approximately 5.6 million, a 17 
increase in revenue from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, when we sold 6,261 oral appliance arches for a total of
approximately 4.8 million. The increase is directly attributable to a 66 decrease in discounts offered during the same period,
with less than 0.2 million in discounts offered during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to approximately 0.6
million of discounts offered during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to the section Material Items, Trends and
Risks Impacting Our Business above for events that impacted our product sales. 

Cost
of Sales and Gross Profit 

Cost
of sales remained relatively constant with an increase of less than 0.1 million, or 1 , at approximately 4.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to slightly under 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due
to 0.7 million in higher costs directly related to an increase in lab fees from our primary vendors, offset by a decrease of less than
 0.3 million related to lower costs associated with the ring lease program and a decrease of slightly over 0.2 million in VIP training,
and a decrease of approximately 0.2 million for inventory obsolescence expense. 

40 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit increased by approximately 0.7 million to 6.9 million. This increase was attributable
to an increase in revenue of approximately 0.8 million offset by an increase in cost of sales of less than 0.1 million. Gross margin
increased to 61 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 59 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 3.5 million, or approximately 20 , to approximately 13.5 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary cause of
this decrease was 1.6 million in professional fees and a change in personnel and related compensation of approximately 1.1
million, including salaries and benefits, paid time off, stock-based compensation, and other employee-related expenses, as a result
of the reduction in force implemented beginning with the second and third quarter of 2023 and 2024. Other cause of the decrease in
general and administrative expenses included a decrease of approximately 0.2 million related to change in allowance for credit losses, a decrease of
approximately 0.3 million related to insurance, a decrease of approximately 0.2 million in travel, meals and entertainment, and a
decrease of approximately 0.1 million in training and education. This was offset by an increase of approximately 0.1 million in
fees related to being a public company. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expenses decreased by 0.5 million or 29 to 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately
 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by lower commissions and digital media
and marketing supplies. 

Depreciation
and Amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization expense was approximately 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 0.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization decreased slightly during the period due to some assets being
fully depreciated and a small amount of depreciable assets placed into service. 

Other
Income 

Other
income of less than 0.1 million includes interest income from financial institutions. 

Excess
warrant fair value and change in fair value of warrant liability, net of issuance costs 

The
liability for the warrants issued in the January 9, 2023 private placement totaled approximately 14.5 million which included 186,667
pre-funded warrants with a fair value of approximately 6.7 million and 266,667 additional common stock purchase warrants with a fair
value of approximately 7.7 million. The difference between the fair value of the 14.5 million liability-classified warrants and the
net proceeds received of approximately 8.0 million, or approximately 6.5 million, was recognized as a day-one non-operating expense.
The change in fair value of the warrant liability was approximately 10.2 million, or 9.6 million of other income net of issuance costs
of 0.6 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net impact of the private placement warrants for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 was approximately 3.9 million of other income. The derivative warrant liability was eliminated in November 2023,
and as a result, no change in fair value of warrant liability was recorded nine month ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of
the Company as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses since inception, including 8.3 and 9.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately 101.4 million as of September
30, 2024. 

Net
cash used in operating activities amounted to approximately 9.8 and 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total liabilities of approximately 7.7 million. 

41 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 6.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, which will not be sufficient to fund operations
and strategic objectives over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. Without additional financing,
these factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
have implemented cost savings measures that lead to reduced impact to cash used in operations. However, sales did not grow in
2023 or in the first half of 2024 as anticipated, as our product offerings and strategies continue to be refined. As such, we have raised
equity capital in late 2023 and early 2024 and will be required to obtain additional financing to satisfy our cash needs and bolster
our stockholders equity for Nasdaq compliance purposes, as management continues to work towards increasing revenue to achieve
cash flow positive operations in the foreseeable future. 

Until
a state of cash flow positivity is reached, management is reviewing all options to obtain additional financing to fund operations. This
financing is expected to come primarily from the issuance of equity securities in order to sustain operations until we can achieve profitability
and positive cash flows, if ever. We expect the SAA with Rebis to increase patient volume, drive top line revenue and lower customer
acquisition costs and overhead. However, there can be no assurances that adequate additional funding will be available on favorable terms,
or at all. If such funds are not available in the future, or that our SAA agreement will result in the patient volume and financial results
within the expected timeline and we may be required to delay, significantly modify or terminate some or all of our operations, all of
which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders. 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable regulations of the SEC, that are reasonably likely to have a
current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Cash
Flows

Net
cash used in operating activities of approximately 9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is an increase of approximately
 0.6 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. This increase is due primarily to a 1.2 million decrease in account payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease
of 0.7 million of prepaid expenses and other assets, 0.5 million in accounts receivable, a decrease of approximately 0.5 million in
contract liability, and a decrease of approximately 0.4 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities. This was offset by the absence
of a 2023 unfavorable net change in the fair value of warrant liability of approximately 3.9 million. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures for software of 0.4
million related to the development of software for internal use expected to be placed in service in 2024. This compares to net cash used
in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 0.7 million due to capital expenditures for internally developed
software and an asset purchase. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities of 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is attributable to proceeds of
 15.7 million from the issuance of Common Stock and Warrants, net of approximately 0.9 million of professional fees and other issuance costs,
in our February warrant inducement, as well as the June and September private placements. This compares to net cash used in
investing financing for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 7.4 million, attributable to gross proceeds of 8.0 million
from the issuance of Common Stock, net of approximately 0.6 million of professional fees and other issuance costs, from our private
placement in January 2023.

Critical
Accounting Policies Involving Management Estimates and Assumptions 

Our
critical accounting policies and estimates are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Involving Management Estimates and Assumptions in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as amended. We have reviewed and determined that those critical accounting
policies and estimates remain our critical accounting policies and estimates as of and for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that
are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed in Note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements included in this Report, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective could
have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption. For additional information on recently issued
accounting standards and our plans for adoption of those standards, please refer to the section titled Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 under Note 1 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Trade
Policy Risk. Certain of our products or components are manufactured outside the United States. Most products imported into the United
States is subject to duty and restrictive quotas on the amount of products that can be imported from certain countries into the United
States each year. Because of the duty rates and quotas, changes in U.S. trade policy as reflected in various legislation, trade preference
programs and trade agreements have the potential to materially impact our sourcing strategy and the competitiveness of its contract manufacturers.
We manage this risk by continually monitoring U.S. trade policy, analyzing the impact of changes in such policy and adjusting its manufacturing
and sourcing strategy accordingly. 

Foreign
Currency Risk. We receive United States dollars for all of our product sales. Currently, all inventory purchases from our non-U.S.
contract manufacturers are also denominated in United States dollars; however, should we make purchases in foreign currencies in the
future, purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar, which
may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods in the future. 

Commodity
Price Risk. We are subject to commodity price risk arising from price fluctuations in the market prices of sourced titanium and steel
products or the various raw materials components of its manufactured products. We are subject to commodity price risk to the extent that
any fluctuations in the market prices of its purchased titanium and steel products and raw materials are not reflected by adjustments
in selling prices of its products or if such adjustments significantly trail changes in these costs. We neither enter into significant
long-term sales contracts nor enter into significant long-term purchase contracts. We do not engage in hedging activities with respect
to such risk . 

Credit
Risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms
of their contractual obligations. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing
of expected cash flows. Certain financial instruments potentially subject our company to a concentration of credit risk. These financial
instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts and vendor receivables. We place our cash and cash equivalents
with high-credit, quality financial institutions. The balances in these accounts exceed the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the appropriate time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. We, under the supervision of
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting, which we describe in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, as amended (the Form 10-K ). 

Remediation
of Material Weakness 

We
are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that significant
deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated as soon as possible. We believe we have made progress towards remediation
and continue to implement our remediation plan for the previously reported material weakness in internal control over financial reporting,
described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our remediation plan, which we implemented in 2023, included: (i) increasing
dedicated personnel and the use of third-party consultants with technical account expertise, (ii) improving our internal reporting processes,
(iii) designing and implementing new controls, and (iv) enhancing our supporting technology. In particular, we believe we have significantly
improved our revenue recognition procedures, our technical accounting capabilities, including with respect to accounting for our outstanding
warrants, and process-level control activities. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have taken strides to complete the full remediation of all of our internal control deficiencies and associated
material weakness by undertaking the plan noted above. We believe that additional review and testing is required in the coming periods
during 2024 before we can affirmatively declare that the material weakness has been fully remediated. 

We
will consider the material weakness remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management
has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. We expect to engage in this testing during 2024. However,
we cannot provide assurance that these or other measures will fully remediate our material weaknesses in a timely manner. If our remediation
of these material weaknesses is not effective, it may cause our company to become subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. It
may also adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. There can be no assurance
that all existing material weaknesses have been identified, or that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
as described above, we made no other changes in internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Below
is a description of our outstanding pending litigation matters. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result
in the below described or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. 

On
June 5, 2020, we filed suit against Ortho-Tain, Inc. Ortho-Tain in the United States District Court for the District
of Colorado seeking relief from certain false, threatening, and defamatory statements to our business affiliate, Benco Dental Benco ).
We believe such statements have interfered with our business relationship and contract, causing harm to our reputation, loss of goodwill,
and unspecified monetary damages. On February 12, 2021, we amended our complaint to add claims for false advertising and unfair business
practices, as well as additional variants of the original claims to address Ortho-Tain s alleged false advertising campaign against
us in the fall of 2020. Our amended complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief to prevent what we believe are defamatory statements
and interference with our business relationships by Ortho-Tain. 

We
further seek declaratory relief to refute the defendant s false allegations, as well as monetary damages. Prior to filing suit,
we worked collaboratively with legal counsel at Benco to address and resolve this matter. Such efforts were unsuccessful. On February
26, 2021, Ortho-Tain, Inc. filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. We opposed the motion. On June 21, 2022, the Tenth Circuit
entered an order and judgment. Pursuant to such order, the appeal was terminated, and the case remanded to the U.S. District Court for
the District of Colorado for further proceedings. On July 13, 2022, the Clerk of Court for the Tenth Circuit transferred jurisdiction
back to the District Court. On February 14, 2024, the District Court issued an order denying Ortho-Tain s motion to dismiss after
analyzing the issue of litigation privilege under the standard ordered by the Tenth Circuit. In response, Ortho-Tain filed a notice of
appeal of the District Court s order on February 14, 2024. The appeal has been docketed in the Tenth Circuit, and the record has
been completed. On March 5, 2024, Vivos filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Ortho-Tain filed its response
to the motion to dismiss on March 19, 2024. Vivos reply in support of the motion to dismiss was filed on March 26, 2024. On March
20, 2024, the Court ordered that Vivos motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction would be referred to the panel of judges to
be assigned to the appeal, and that no ruling on the motion to dismiss would be issued at that time. Ortho-Tain filed its opening brief
on April 29, 2024. Vivos filed its Answer Brief on May 29, 2024. Ortho-Tain filed its response brief on June 20, 2024. 

On
July 22, 2020 Ortho-Tain filed a Complaint at Law (the Ortho-Tain Complaint in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois naming Vivos, along with the Company s Chief Executive Officer, R. Kirk Huntsman, Benco Dental Supply
Co., Dr. Brian Kraft, Dr. Ben Miraglia, and Dr. Mark Musso. The Ortho-Tain Complaint alleges violation of the Lanham Act and an alleged
civil conspiracy among the defendants to violate the Lanham Act by an alleged false designation of origin related to a presentation given
by Dr. Brian Kraft at an event sponsored by the Company and Benco Dental. Ortho-Tain also alleges that the actions of the defendants,
including the Company, diverted sales from Ortho-Tain, deprived Ortho-Tain of advertising value and resulted in a loss of goodwill to
Ortho-Tain. Ortho-Tain also alleges two separate breach of contract actions against Dr. Brian Kraft and the Company s Chief Executive
Officer, R. Kirk Huntsman. On September 9, 2020, the Company moved to dismiss the claims against it. On May 14, 2021, the United States
District Judge entered an order granting the Company s motion to stay this case pending the outcome of a substantially similar,
first-filed suit by the Company pending in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. In light of the stay, the Court
denied, without prejudice, the Company s pending motion to dismiss. On March 2, 2023, the Court lifted the stay. 

The
Defendants renewed their motions to dismiss. On August 23, 2024, the Court issued its order partially granting the motions to dismiss.
Ortho-Tain subsequently sought leave to amend its Complaint to try and address the deficiencies identified by the Court in its August
23, 2024 order. The Defendants opposed the Motion for Leave to Amend, and, on October 9, 2024, the Court held a hearing to address
the Motion for Leave to Amend. The Court denied Plaintiff s Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint without Prejudice. 

The
Parties submitted a Joint Discovery Plan to the Court on October 21, 2024. On October 22, 2024, the Court ordered the parties to exchange
Rule 26(a)(1) initial disclosures by November 22, 2024 and Initial Written Discovery to Be Issued by the same date. The Court set a deadline
of May 16, 2025 to Amend pleadings and July 30, 2025 to complete fact discovery. 

On
April 13, 2023, the Court ordered the parties to exchange Rule 26(a) disclosures by May 1, 2023 and issue initial written discovery by
May 15, 2023. Further, the Court referred the matter to the Magistrate Judge to conduct a settlement conference. On April 28, 2023, the
Court clarified that Dr. Musso s court ordered participation in settlement and discovery did not waive his objections to personal
jurisdiction and venue, and that Defendants did not need to file a response to the Complaint at this time. On June 2, 2023, the case
was reassigned to the Hon. LaShonda A. Hunt. On July 11, 2023, the Magistrate Judge scheduled a settlement conference for September 1,
2023. On August 1, 2023, Judge Hunt set a deadline to refile motions to dismiss as August 15, 2023, stayed discovery pending resolution
of the motions, and authorized the parties to cancel the settlement conference. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on August 15, 2023,
and a reply brief on October 3, 2023. The Parties are currently awaiting a decision on the motion to dismiss.
