 N otes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (unaudited) 

, the Company has its corporate headquarters in Alpharetta, Georgia. The Company s activities since inception have primarily consisted of developing product and technology rights, raising capital and performing research and development activities. The Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties similar to those of other life science companies at a similar stage of development, including, among others, the need to obtain adequate additional financing, successful development efforts including regulatory approval of products, compliance with government regulations, successful commercialization of potential products, protection of proprietary technology and dependence on key individuals. Liquidity The Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of million as of September 30, 2024. Historically, the Company has funded its operations primarily through the sale of common stock and convertible preferred stock, the issuance of warrants, the issuance of long-term debt, and license agreements. On February 6, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors and an existing stockholder, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold, in a registered direct offering (the Registered Direct Offering ): (i) an aggregate of shares of its common stock; and (ii) warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock (the Warrants ). The combined purchase price of each share and accompanying Warrant was . The exercise price for the Warrants is per share. The Warrants will be exercisable from and will expire on . The net proceeds to the Company from the Registered Direct Offering were million. On January 31, 2024 (the Amendment Effective Date ), the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the license agreement (as amended, the Emory License Agreement with Emory University and Georgia Tech Research Corporation (collectively, the Licensor pursuant to which the parties agreed to reduce the Sublicense Percentage (as defined in the Emory License Agreement) from a low double digit percentage to a high single digit percentage that the Company will pay the Licensor applicable to any fees or payments paid to the Company by any Sublicensee (as defined in the Emory License Agreement) of the Licensed Patents and/or Licensed Technology (each as defined in the Emory License Agreement), excluding (i) amounts paid to the Company by a Sublicensee to reimburse the Company for certain research and development costs pursuant to a written agreement between the Company and such Sublicensee, (ii) the value of intellectual property transferred or granted to the Company if necessary or helpful to the development or commercialization of Licensed Products (as defined in the Emory License Agreement) and (iii) amounts paid for shares of the Company s stock. The payment to Licensor of any such Sublicense Percentage is due within 30 days of receipt by the Company of a qualifying payment from a Sublicensee, provided however, with respect to any qualifying payments received by the Company from a Sublicensee prior to January 1, 2025, the payment to Licensor of any such Sublicensee Percentage is due to Licensor by March 31, 2025. The parties also agreed to a revised annual license maintenance fee due each year (the Maintenance Fee starting in 2023 through 2028, as follows: for 2023 through 2025, for 2026, for 2027 and for 2028. The Company paid the Maintenance Fee for 2023 in February 2024 and the Maintenance Fee for 2024 in October 2024. The remaining annual Maintenance Fee payments are due on October 1st of each year. On December 22, 2023, Clearside Biomedical, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary Clearside Royalty LLC ("Royalty Sub"), entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement with HCR (as defined below) and HCR Clearside SPV, LLC (as assignee of HCR Collateral Management, LLC) Agent amending that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of August 8, 2022, by and among Royalty Sub, HCR and Agent ("Purchase and Sale Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement, Royalty Sub and Agent mutually agreed that Royalty Sub waived any and all rights to the million milestone payment which was deposited in an escrow account First Milestone Payment") in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement and agreed to the release of the First Milestone Payment to Agent. On November 1, 2023, the Company, entered into a license agreement (the BioCryst License Agreement with BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. BioCryst pursuant to which the Company granted BioCryst an exclusive, worldwide and sublicensable license to the Company s SCS Microinjector for the delivery of BioCryst s proprietary plasma kallikrein inhibitor known as avoralstat for the treatment and prevention of diabetic macular edema DME ). The Company received an upfront license fee payment of million in connection with signing of the BioCryst License Agreement. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive up to an additional million in clinical and regulatory milestone payments, and up to a total of million in a series of post-approval sales-based milestone payments based on the achievement of annual global net product sales milestones up to billion. Further, during the royalty term, BioCryst has also agreed to pay the Company tiered mid-single digit royalties on annual global net product 

 7 

billion, subject to reductions in specified circumstances. The Company s rights to these royalties and milestone payments have been sold pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement as described in Note 5. In May 2023, the Company terminated its at-the-market sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC (the "ATM Agreement"). The Company sold shares of its common stock for net proceeds of million under its ATM Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC d uring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, prior to the termination of the ATM Agreement. In May 2023, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. ("Cantor") under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to million through Cantor as its sales agent. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold shares of its common stock for net proceeds of million under the Sales Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold shares of its common stock for net proceeds of million pursuant to the Sales Agreement. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company sold shares of its common stock for net proceeds of million pursuant to the Sales Agreement. The Company has suffered recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant revenue. The Company has no current source of revenue to sustain present activities. The Company does not expect to generate other meaningful revenue until and unless the Company's licensees successfully commercialize XIPERE and the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, its other licensees receive regulatory approval and successfully commercialize its product candidates, or the Company commercializes its product candidates either on its own or with a third party. In the absence of product or other revenues, the amount, timing, nature or source of which cannot be predicted, the Company s losses will continue as it conducts its research and development activities. The Company will continue to need to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, including completing the development, partnering and potential commercialization of its primary product candidates. The Company will need to obtain financing to complete the development and conduct clinical trials for the regulatory approval of its product candidates if requested by regulatory bodies. If such product candidates were to receive regulatory approval, the Company would need to obtain financing to prepare for the potential commercialization of its product candidates, if the Company decides to commercialize the products on its own. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Based on its current plans and forecasted expenses, the Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of the filing date, November 12, 2024, will enable the Company to fund its planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2025. The Company has based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and it could exhaust its capital resources sooner than expected. Until the Company can generate sufficient revenue, the Company will need to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, license agreements, debt financings or restructurings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing or distribution arrangements. The Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

There were additional issuance costs of million related to the Purchase and Sale Agreement resulting in net proceeds of million. An additional million was deposited by HCR in an escrow account which was released to HCR pursuant to the Letter Agreement described below. The terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement also provide for an additional million milestone payment to Royalty Sub upon attainment of a second pre-specified sales milestone related to 2024 XIPERE sales (the "Second Milestone Event"). On December 22, 2023, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Royalty Sub, entered into the Letter Agreement with the Agent amending the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement, Royalty Sub and Agent mutually agreed that Royalty Sub waived any and all rights to the First Milestone Payment in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement and agreed to the release of the First Milestone Payment to Agent. Issuance costs pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement consisting primarily of advisory and legal fees, totaled million including the amount of HCR's transaction-related expenses that the Company reimbursed. The effective interest rate includes cash flow projections for future royalty and milestone payments, which are sensitive to certain assumptions, including market size, market penetration and sales price, that are forward looking and could be affected by future market conditions.

 Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on revolutionizing the delivery of therapies to the back of the eye through the suprachoroidal space, or SCS . Our novel SCS injection platform, utilizing our proprietary SCS Microinjector , enables an in-office, repeatable, non-surgical procedure for the targeted and compartmentalized delivery of a wide variety of therapies to the macula, retina or choroid to potentially preserve and improve vision in participants with sight-threatening eye diseases. Our SCS injection platform can be used in conjunction with existing drugs designed for delivery to the SCS, novel therapies and future therapeutic innovations. We believe our proprietary suprachoroidal administration platform has the potential to become a standard for delivery of therapies intended to treat chorioretinal diseases. 
 We are leveraging our SCS injection platform by building an internal research and development pipeline targeting retinal diseases and by creating external collaborations with other companies. We are developing our own pipeline of small molecule product candidates for administration via our SCS Microinjector, and we also strategically partner with companies developing other ophthalmic therapeutic innovations to be administered using our SCS injection platform. Our first product, XIPERE (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) for suprachoroidal use, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in October 2021. Approval of XIPERE was a significant milestone for us as it is the first approved therapeutic delivered into the SCS, the first commercial product developed by us and the first therapy for macular edema associated with uveitis. We believe that we are creating a broad therapeutic platform for developing product candidates to treat serious eye diseases. 
 18 

The current development status of our pipeline of internal product candidates and external collaborations is summarized in the charts below: 

Clinical Development Pipeline 
 CLS-AX (axitinib injectable suspension) 
 CLS-AX, our most advanced product candidate, is our proprietary suspension of the TKI axitinib for suprachoroidal injection delivered via our SCS Microinjector. We are developing CLS-AX for administration to the SCS as a long-acting therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), a retinal degenerative disease that causes a progressive loss of central vision. 
 In February 2023, we announced the final, positive results from the OASIS Phase 1/2a clinical trial in wet AMD. CLS-AX was well-tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile across all cohorts. The full extension data for Cohorts 3 and 4 showed promising durability and signs of biological effect. 
 Based on the results from the OASIS trial, we conducted a randomized, active-controlled, double-masked, parallel-group, multicenter, 36-week, Phase 2b clinical trial of CLS-AX in participants with wet AMD previously treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, which is the standard of care therapy for the treatment of wet AMD. The trial is referred to as ODYSSEY. A total of 60 participants were treated for 36 weeks and randomized to either CLS-AX (1 mg) or aflibercept (2 mg) with a 2:1 randomization schedule (40 participants in CLS-AX arm and 20 participants in aflibercept arm). CLS-AX was administered by suprachoroidal injection via our SCS Microinjector, and aflibercept was administered via intravitreal injection. Participants in the trial were determined to have active disease with a median duration of wet AMD diagnosis of 9.9 months. Eligible participants underwent diagnostic imaging at their screening visit, followed by masked reading center confirmation of persistent active disease. 
 On October 9, 2024, we announced positive topline results from the ODYSSEY trial of CLS-AX for the treatment of wet AMD. The ODYSSEY trial achieved its primary and secondary outcomes including the mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, changes from baseline in visual function and ocular anatomy, the need for supplemental treatment, treatment burden as measured by total injections over the trial duration, and safety measures. 
 19 

Participants in the trial maintained stable BCVA throughout the trial as measured by the mean change in BCVA from baseline to week 36. In addition, participants maintained stable central subfield retinal thickness, or CSRT, throughout the trial as measured by the mean change in CSRT from baseline to week 36, as confirmed by the independent reading center. 
 In terms of durability, after receiving the baseline CLS-AX dose, 100 (40/40) of participants went 3 months without receiving any additional treatment, 90 (35/39) of participants went 4 months without receiving any additional treatment, 81 (30/37) of participants went 5 months without receiving any additional treatment and 67 (26/39) of participants went 6 months without receiving any additional treatment before mandatory re-dosing at week 24. If intervention were strictly based on the disease activity assessment criteria, 100 (40/40) of participants would have gone 3 months without receiving any additional treatment, 95 (37/39) of CLS-AX participants would have gone 4 months without receiving any additional treatment, 87 (32/37) of participants would have gone 5 months without receiving any additional treatment and 79 (30/38) of participants would have gone 6 months without receiving any additional treatment before mandatory re-dosing at week 24. 
 Additionally, we observed reduced injection frequency by 84 in the 24 weeks after baseline compared to the average monthly injections in the 24 weeks prior to screening. 
 CLS-AX was well-tolerated with a safety profile through 36 weeks that included mandatory re-dosing of CLS-AX at week 24. There were no reported ocular serious adverse events, or SAEs, and no treatment or injection procedure-related SAEs. All ocular adverse events were considered clinically mild in both groups. We observed similar discontinuation rates in the CLS-AX and aflibercept arms. 
 Although our Phase 3 plans are in development and subject to change, we are currently planning to run two Phase 3 trials with aflibercept 2 mg as a comparator. We are likely to conduct the studies in treatment-na ve patients with a flexible dosing component, consistent with the Phase 3 trial designs for recently approved aflibercept high dose and faricimab. We expect to conduct an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in early 2025 to align on the essential components of our Phase 3 program. 
 Preclinical 
 We have an experienced team of scientists and researchers evaluating small molecules that may be utilized as potential treatment options for back of the eye diseases utilizing our SCS Microinjector for delivery in the suprachoroidal space. Our research team is currently evaluating various small molecules through in vivo models for the potential treatment of geographic atrophy, or GA. We believe that GA is primarily a choroidal disease. Delivery of small molecules via suprachoroidal injection enables comprehensive drug coverage of both the retina and choroid, while also potentially minimizing systemic and anterior segment side effects. 
 External Collaborations Pipeline 
 In order to expand the global reach of our suprachoroidal injection platform, we have strategically partnered some of our assets for development and/or commercialization and intend to continue partnering our assets. By entering into these partnerships, we have been able to expand the use of our suprachoroidal injection platform to other indications and geographies globally. We currently have collaborations with Bausch + Lomb, Arctic Vision, REGENXBIO, Inc., Aura Biosciences and BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 Commercial Product 
 XIPERE (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension) for suprachoroidal use, was approved by the FDA in October 2021. XIPERE is the first approved therapeutic delivered into the SCS, the first commercial product developed by us and the first therapy for macular edema associated with uveitis. XIPERE commercialization rights are licensed to Bausch + Lomb in the United States and Canada and Arctic Vision in the Asia Pacific region, not including Japan. 
 ISO and EC Certifications 
 We have received the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Certification EN ISO 13485:2016 for The design, development, and manufacture of sterile piston syringes, needles, and associated accessories for the area of ophthalmology. The certificate is available on our website. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We have received European Community (EC) Certification for the SCS Microinjector from our Notified Body, Intertek Medical Notified Body, AB. The Certificate of Conformance with the Medical Device Regulation 2017/745, Annex IV was issued July 21, 2023, with the Intended Purpose of the SCS Microinjector as "delivery of triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, 40 mg/mL to the suprachoroidal space of the eye".

Operating Outlook 
 We have incurred net losses since our inception. In recent years, our operations have consisted primarily of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, raising capital and undertaking other research and development initiatives. To date, we primarily generated revenue through upfront payments and milestone payments related to license agreements and from collaboration agreements, and we have primarily financed our operations through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities, issuance of warrants, issuances of convertible promissory notes and loan agreements. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 348.0 million. We recorded net losses of 7.7 million and 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 27.0 million and 27.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We anticipate that a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts in the foreseeable future will be focused on completing the necessary development for and obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates, as well as discovering compounds and developing proprietary formulations to utilize with our SCS Microinjector. 
 We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses at least for the next several years. We do not expect to generate significant product or license and other revenue unless and until XIPERE is successfully commercialized by our licensees or until we successfully complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize additional product candidates, either on our own or together with a third party. Our financial results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect clinical trial expenses to increase in the remainder of 2024 as a result of our Phase 2b clinical trial of CLS-AX and activities related to preparation for a Phase 3 clinical trial of CLS-AX, as well as continuing our pipeline development. We also will continue our efforts to discover, research and develop additional product candidates and obtain regulatory approvals in additional regions for XIPERE for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Unfavorable conditions in the economy in the United States and abroad may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic events, rising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates, and conflicts in Ukraine, Russia and the Middle East have led to economic uncertainty globally. The effect of macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. If, however, economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. For further discussion of the potential impacts of macroeconomic events on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024. 
 Components of Operating Results 
 License and Other Revenue 
 We have not generated any revenue from the sale of XIPERE and we do not expect to generate any other product revenue unless or until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our other product candidates, either on our own or with a third party. The revenue received under the Bausch license agreement, as well as other certain payments from our licensees, will be recorded as non-cash revenue until we have fulfilled our obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Our revenue in recent years has been generated primarily from our license agreements. We are seeking to enter into additional licenses and other agreements with third parties to evaluate the potential use of our proprietary SCS Microinjector with the third party s product candidates for the treatment of various eye diseases. These agreements may include payments to us for technology access, upfront license payments, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties. 
 Costs of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold are related to the sales of our SCS Microinjector kits to our licensees for approved products. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the research and development of our preclinical and clinical product candidates, which include: 
 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense for research and development personnel; 

expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as contract manufacturing organizations and consultants that conduct clinical trials and preclinical studies; 

costs associated with preclinical activities and clinical trials; 

costs associated with submitting regulatory approval applications for our product candidates; 

21 

costs associated with training physicians on the suprachoroidal injection procedure and educating and providing them with appropriate product candidate information; 

costs associated with technology and intellectual property licenses; 

costs for our research and development facility; and 

depreciation expense for assets used in research and development activities. 

We expense research and development costs to operations as incurred. These costs include preclinical activities, such as manufacturing and stability and toxicology studies, that are supportive of the product candidate itself. In addition, there are expenses related to clinical trials and similar activities for each program, including costs associated with CROs. Clinical costs are recognized based on the terms of underlying agreements, as well as an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as participant enrollment, clinical site activations and additional information provided to us by our vendors about their actual costs incurred. Expenses related to activities that support more than one development program or activity, such as salaries, share-based compensation and depreciation, are not classified as direct preclinical costs or clinical costs and are separately classified as unallocated. 
 The following table shows our research and development expenses by program for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).

Our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of participant enrollment and related expenses at clinical investigator sites as well as estimates for the services received and efforts expended under contracts with research institutions, consultants and CROs that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. We generally accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on contracted amounts applied to the level of participant enrollment and activity according to the protocol. If future timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we would modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. However, it is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our current or future preclinical programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our current or future product candidates. 
 The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that may include, among others: 
 the costs associated with process development, scale-up and manufacturing of our product candidates including the SCS Microinjector for clinical trials and for requirements associated with regulatory filings; 

the number of trials required for approval and any requirement for extension trials; 

per participant trial costs; 

the number of participants that participate in the trials; 

the number of sites included in the trials; 

the countries in which the trials are conducted; 

the length of time required to enroll eligible participants; 

the number of doses that participants receive; 

the drop-out or discontinuation rates of participants; 

potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; 

22 

the duration of participant follow-up; and 

the efficacy and safety profiles of the product candidates. 

In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment of each product candidate s commercial potential. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including share-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative costs historically included commercial pre-launch preparations for XIPERE, and also include facility related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, and accounting and audit services. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of the accrued interest and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest income is not considered significant to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net consists of expenses allocated to the warrants issued in connection with our registered direct offering in February 2024 and the change in fair value during the period. 
 Non-cash Interest Expense on Liability Related to the Sales of Future Royalties 
 Non-cash interest expense on liability related to the sales of future royalties consists of imputed interest on the carrying value of the liability and the amortization of the related issuance costs. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Significant estimates include assumptions used in the determination of share-based compensation and some of our research and development expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024, other than the warrant liabilities discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

License and other revenue . In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 1.0 million and 0.9 million, respectively, of revenue associated with our license agreements, which includes revenue for services and the sales of our SCS Microinjector kits to our licensees. 
 Cost of goods sold. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 0.1 million in cost of goods sold related to the sales of our SCS Microinjector kits to our licensees of approved products. 
 Research and development . Research and development expenses decreased by 1.0 million from 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a 1.9 million decrease in costs related to the CLS-AX program, which includes costs for ODYSSEY, our Phase 2b clinical trial. This is partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in employee related costs, a 0.2 million increase in device development and a 0.3 million research and development tax credit received in the prior year. 
 General and administrative . General and administrative expenses increased by 0.2 million from 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This is primarily due to an increase in patent-related expenses and consulting fees. 
 Interest income. Interest income decreased by 0.1 million from 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is due to the lower balance of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 Other income, net. Other income, net was 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was due to the decrease in fair value of the warrant liabilities from the June 30, 2024 valuation date. 
 Non-cash interest expense on liability related to the sales of future royalties . Non-cash interest expense on liability related to the sales of future royalties was 2.5 million and 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was comprised of imputed interest on the liability related to the sales of future royalties and the amortization of the associated issuance costs.

License and other revenue . In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized 1.4 million and 1.9 million, respectively, of revenue associated with our license agreements, which includes revenue for services and the sales of our SCS Microinjector kits to our licensees. 
 Cost of goods sold. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 0.4 million in cost of goods sold related to the sales of our SCS Microinjector kits to our licensees. 
 Research and development . Research and development expenses decreased by 0.2 million from 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a 1.2 million decrease in costs related to the CLS-AX program, which includes costs for ODYSSEY, our Phase 2b clinical trial, and a 0.7 million decrease in costs related to our preclinical programs. This is partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in consulting fees, a 0.2 million increase in recruiting fees, a 0.1 million increase in depreciation and a 0.1 million increase in the amortization of a license maintenance fee. In addition, there was a 0.8 million research and development tax credit received in the prior year. 
 General and administrative . General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.2 million, from 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily attributable to a 0.6 million decrease in professional fees partially offset by a 0.4 million increase in consulting fees. 
 Interest income. Interest income decreased by 0.3 million from 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is due to the lower balance of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
 Other income, net. Other income, net was 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was due to the decrease in fair value of the warrant liabilities of 1.6 million from February 9, 2024, the issuance date of the warrants, to September 30, 2024 partially offset by 0.8 million of direct registered offering costs that were allocated to the warrants. 
 Non-cash interest expense on liability related to the sales of future royalties . Non-cash interest expense on liability related to the sales of future royalties was 7.2 million and 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was comprised of imputed interest on the liability related to the sales of future royalties and the amortization of the associated issuance costs. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We have funded our operations primarily through the proceeds of public offerings of our common stock, sales of convertible preferred stock, issuance of warrants and the issuance of long-term debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 23.6 million. We invest any cash in excess of our immediate requirements primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. As of September 30, 2024, our funds were held in cash, money market funds and treasury bills. 
 On February 6, 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold, in a registered direct offering: (i) an aggregate of 11,111,111 shares of our common stock; and (ii) 11,111,111 Warrants. The combined purchase price of each share and accompanying Warrant was 1.35. The exercise price for the Warrants is 1.62 per share. The Warrants will be 
 25 

exercisable from August 9, 2024 and will expire on August 9, 2029. The net proceeds to us from the Registered Direct Offering were 13.9 million. 
 On January 31, 2024, or the Amendment Effective Date, we entered into a fourth amendment to the license agreement, or the Emory License Agreement, with Emory University and Georgia Tech Research Corporation, or, collectively, the Licensor, pursuant to which the parties agreed to reduce the Sublicense Percentage (as defined in the Emory License Agreement) from a low double digit percentage to a high single digit percentage that we will pay the Licensor applicable to any fees or payments paid to us by any Sublicensee (as defined in the Emory License Agreement) of the Licensed Patents and/or Licensed Technology (each as defined in the Emory License Agreement), excluding (i) amounts paid to us by a Sublicensee to reimburse us for certain research and development costs pursuant to a written agreement between us and such Sublicensee, (ii) the value of intellectual property transferred or granted to us if necessary or helpful to the development or commercialization of Licensed Products (as defined in the Emory License Agreement) and (iii) amounts paid for shares of our stock. The payment to Licensor of any such Sublicense Percentage is due within 30 days of receipt by us of a qualifying payment from a Sublicensee, provided however, with respect to any qualifying payments received by us from a Sublicensee prior to January 1, 2025, the payment to Licensor of any such Sublicensee Percentage is due to Licensor by March 31, 2025. The parties also agreed to a revised annual license maintenance fee due each year, or the Maintenance Fee, starting in 2023 through 2028, as follows: 0.3 million for 2023 through 2025, 0.4 million for each of 2026 and 2027 and 0.5 million for 2028. We paid the Maintenance Fee for 2023 in February 2024 and the Maintenance Fee for 2024 in October 2024. The remaining annual Maintenance Fee payments are due on October 1st of each year. 
 On December 22, 2023, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary Royalty Sub, entered into a letter agreement, or the Letter Agreement, with HCR and HCR Clearside SPV, LLC (as assignee of HCR Collateral Management, LLC), or the Agent, amending that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of August 8, 2022, by and among Royalty Sub, HCR and Agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement, Royalty Sub and Agent mutually agreed that Royalty Sub waived any and all rights to the 12.5 million milestone payment which was deposited in an escrow account, or the First Milestone Payment, in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement and agreed to the release of the First Milestone Payment to Agent. 
 In November 2023, we entered into a license agreement, or the BioCryst License Agreement, with BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or BioCryst, pursuant to which we granted BioCryst an exclusive, worldwide and sublicensable license to our SCS Microinjector for the delivery of BioCryst s proprietary plasma kallikrein inhibitor known as avoralstat for the treatment and prevention of diabetic macular edema, or DME. We received an upfront license fee payment of 5.0 million in connection with signing of the BioCryst License Agreement. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to an additional 30.0 million in clinical and regulatory milestone payments, and up to a total of 47.5 million in a series of post-approval sales-based milestone payments based on the achievement of annual global net product sales milestones up to 2.0 billion. Further, during the royalty term, BioCryst has also agreed to pay us tiered mid-single digit royalties on annual global net product sales, with the highest royalty rate applied to sales over 1.5 billion, subject to reductions in specified circumstances. Our rights to these royalties and milestone payments have been sold pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement described in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 In May 2023, we terminated our at-the-market sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC (the "ATM Agreement"). During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, prior to the termination of the ATM Agreement, we sold 515,959 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 0.7 million under the ATM Agreement. 
 In May 2023, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") with Cantor Fitzgerald Co., or Cantor, under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million through Cantor as our sales agent. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 339,912 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 0.5 million under the Sales Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 330,210 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 0.4 million under the Sales Agreement. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we sold 1,097,932 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of 1.3 million under the Sales Agreement . 
 Funding Requirements 
 Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, research and development costs to build our product candidate pipeline, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs. In addition, we have certain contractual obligations for future payments. Refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As such, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of CLS-AX or any future product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from product sales. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of: 
 successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; 

26 

receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; 

obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and 

launching commercial sales of the products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that candidate. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and potential collaboration, license and development agreements. Other than potential payments we may receive under our license and other agreements, we do not currently have any committed external source of funds, though, as described above, we may also be able to sell our common stock under the Sales Agreement with Cantor subject to the terms of that agreement and depending on market conditions. We expect that we will require additional capital to fund our ongoing operations. Additional funds may not be available to us on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide and related macroeconomic changes, such as rising inflation. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. 
 If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, including any future collaboration or licensing arrangement for XIPERE outside of the territories in which we have previously licensed or granted options to license XIPERE, we may be required to relinquish additional rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 We also incur costs as a public company, including costs and expenses for fees to members of our board of directors, accounting and finance personnel costs, directors and officers insurance premiums, audit and legal fees, investor relations fees and expenses for compliance with reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. 
 Outlook 
 We have suffered recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and anticipate incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that we can generate significant milestone payments and royalties from XIPERE and other licensing arrangements or revenues from other product candidates. We will need additional financing to fund our operations. Our plans primarily consist of raising additional capital, potentially in a combination of equity or debt financings, monetizing royalties, or restructurings, or potentially entering into additional collaborations, partnerships and other strategic arrangements. 
 Based on our current plans and forecasted expenses, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of the filing date, November 12, 2024, will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2025. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. We will require additional capital in order to complete the clinical development of CLS-AX. 
 These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 27 

Cash Flows 
 The following is a summary of the net cash flows (used in) provided by our operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 

2024

(19,616) 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating activities used net cash of 19.4 million and 18.6 million, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to ongoing research and development expenses to develop our pipeline and ongoing costs for ODYSSEY, as well as the supporting general and administrative costs. The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to ongoing research and development expenses to develop our pipeline and startup costs for ODYSSEY, as well as the supporting general and administrative costs. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our investing activities used net cash of 9.9 million and 1.7 million, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 16.9 million for the purchase of short-term investments and 0.5 million for the acquisition of property and equipment, partially offset by 7.5 million of maturity of short-term investments. The net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 1.7 million for the acquisition of property and equipment. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our financing activities provided net cash of 14.4 million and 0.7 million, respectively. The cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 13.9 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering and 0.5 million of net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement. The cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of 0.9 million of proceeds received from the sale of our common stock under the ATM Agreement partially offset by a payment of 0.4 million related to the Purchase and Sale Agreement. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at the reasonable assurance level. 
 28 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal control over financial reporting. 
 29 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. In addition to the other information set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors described below and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2024. 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. 
 Our historical financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 348.0 million and we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 23.6 million. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Based on its current plans and forecasted expenses, the Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of the filing date, November 12, 2024, will enable the Company to fund its planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2025. The Company has based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and it could exhaust its capital resources sooner than expected. Until the Company can generate sufficient revenue, the Company will need to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, license agreements, debt financings or restructurings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing or distribution arrangements. 
 The perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors and employees. Additionally, if we are unable to continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company. 
 Additional financing may not be available to us when needed or, if available, it may not be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the necessary additional financing on a timely or commercially reasonable basis, we will be forced to delay or scale down some or all of our development activities (or perhaps even cease the operation of our business). Our access to additional capital may be negatively affected by future recessions, downturns in the economy or the markets as a whole, or inflation. 
 We have no commitments for any additional financing and such commitments may not be obtained on favorable terms, if at all. Any additional equity financing will be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, raising future capital, and other financial and operational matters. If we are unable to obtain additional financing as needed, we may be required to reduce the scope of our operations or our anticipated expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 None. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 None. 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) , or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
