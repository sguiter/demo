Business
Overview 

Agape
ATP Corporation is a company that provides health and wellness products and health solution advisory services to our clients. The Company
primarily focus its efforts on attracting customers in Malaysia. Its advisory services center on the ATP Zeta Health Program ,
which is a health program designed to effectively prevent diseases caused by polluted environments, unhealthy dietary intake and unhealthy
lifestyles, and promotion of health. The program aims to promote improved health and longevity in our clients through a combination of
modern medicine, proper nutrition and advice from skilled nutritionists and/or dieticians. 

In
order to strengthen the Company s supply chain, on May 8, 2020, the Company has successfully acquired approximately of ASL,
with the goal of securing an established network marketing sales channel that has been established in Malaysia for the past 15 years.
ASL has been offering the Company s ATP Zeta Health Program as part of its product lineup. As such, the acquisition creates synergy
in the Company s operation by boosting the Company s retail and marketing capabilities. The newly acquired subsidiary allows
the Company to fulfill its mission of helping people to create health and wealth by providing a financially rewarding business
opportunity to distributors and quality products to distributors and customers who seek a healthy lifestyle. 

Via

To further its reach in the Health and Wellness Industry, on November 11,

converted into one outstanding share of Common Stock. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock decreased from (pre-split) shares to (post-split) shares. In addition, by reducing the number of outstanding
shares, the Company s loss per share in all prior periods increased by a factor of 20. The Reverse Stock Split affected all shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split. 

Stockholders
who hold a number of pre-reverse stock split shares of the Company s Common Stock not evenly divisible by 20 are entitled the number
of shares rounded up to the nearest whole share. The Company will issue share of the post-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock to any stockholder
who would have received a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. 

The
Reverse Stock Split affected all holders of Common Stock uniformly and did not affect any stockholder s percentage of ownership
interest. The par value of the Company s Common Stock remained unchanged at per share and the number of authorized shares
of Common Stock reduced from shares to shares after the Reverse Stock Split. 

As
the par value per share of the Company s Common Stock remained unchanged at per share, the change in the Common Stock recorded

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Sales
of Skin Care, Health and Wellness products 

-
 Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time 

The
Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when control of the health and wellness
products are transferred to its customer at the Company s office or shipment of the goods. The revenue is recorded net of estimated
discounts and return allowances. Products are given 60 days for returns or exchanges from the date of purchase. Historically, there were
insignificant sales returns. 

Under
the Company s network marketing business, the Company issues product coupons to members and distributors when these customers made
purchases above certain thresholds set by the Company. Depending on the type of product coupons issued, the coupons carry varying values
and can be used by the customers for reduction in the transaction price of product purchases within the coupon validity period. The value
of the product coupons issued is recorded as a reduction of the Company s revenue account upon issuance; the corresponding amount
credited to the customer deposits account. Amounts in customer deposits will be reversed when the coupons are used. The Company s
coupons have a validity period of between six and twelve months. If the Company s customers did not utilize the coupons after the
validity period, the Company would recognize the forfeiture of the originated sales value of the coupons as net revenues. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized and , as forfeited coupon income, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized and , as forfeited coupon income, respectively. 

The

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Lease
terms used to calculate the present value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease,
as the Company does not have reasonable certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised. The Company generally considers
the economic life of its operating lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. The Company has elected
the short-term lease exception, therefore operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve
months or less. Its leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee. The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

The
Company reviews the impairment of its ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for its other long-lived assets. The Company reviews
the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the
asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on its ability to recover the carrying value of the asset
from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations. The Company has elected to include the carrying amount
of operating lease liabilities in any tested asset group and includes the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future
pre-tax cash flows.

instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes the concentration
of credit risk in its account receivable is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short collection
terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for expected credit loss
based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. Historically, the Company
did not have any bad debt on its account receivable.

Exchange rate risk 

The
Company cannot guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain steady; therefore, there is a possibility that the Company could
post the same amount of profit for two comparable periods and because of the fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower
profit depending on exchange rate of RM and HK converted to US on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes
in political and economic environments without notice.

Credit
Facilities 

We
do not have any credit facilities or other access to bank credit. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or
future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include allowance for inventories obsolescence, allowance for expected credit loss, impairment of
long-lived assets and allowance for deferred tax assets. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our
estimates. 

9 

Estimated
allowance for inventories obsolescence 

Management
reviews inventory on hand for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable items, as compared to future demand requirements and the shelf life
of the various products. Based on the review, the Company records inventory write-downs, when necessary, when costs exceed expected net
realizable value. The Company did not recognize any inventory write-downs nor inventory write-off for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. 

Impairment
of long-lived assets 

Operating
right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment are stated at costs less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. In determining
whether an asset is impaired, the Company has to exercise judgment and make estimation, particularly in assessing: (1) whether an event
has occurred or any indicators that may affect the asset value; (2) whether the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable that is
its carrying amount exceeds the amount of expected undiscounted future cash flows result from the use of the asset. Once it is established
that impairment has occurred, the amount of impairment expense is determined as the difference between the carrying value of the asset
and its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the carrying amounts of operating right-of-use assets and property and equipment amounted to 282,734 and 47,508
as compared to December 31, 2023, the carrying amounts of operating right-of-use assets and property and equipment amounted to 357,301
and 77,858, respectively. No impairment losses on operating right-of-use assets and property and equipment were recognized as of September
30, 2024 and 2023. 

Allowance
for deferred tax assets 

The
Company conducts much of its business activities in Malaysia and Hong Kong and is subject to tax in each of these jurisdictions. Significant
estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate
tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from
the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which
such determination is made. 

Deferred
tax assets relating to certain temporary differences and tax losses are recognized as management considers it is more likely than not
that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences or tax losses can be utilized. Where the expectation
is different from the original estimate, such differences will impact the recognition of deferred tax assets and taxation in the periods
in which such estimate is changed . 

Allowance for expected credit loss 

The Company estimates and records an allowance for its expected credit
loss related to its accounts receivable. Credit losses are determined
by Current Estimate of Expected Credit Losses model in accordance with Topic 326 Financial Instruments Credit Losses.
For accounts receivable, the Company considers historical collectivity based on past due status, the age of the accounts receivable balances,
credit quality of the Company s customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable
forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect the Company s ability to collect from customers.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Revenue
recognition 

The
 Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606). The core principle underlying the revenue recognition of this ASU allows
the Company to recognize revenue that represents the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This will require the Company to identify contractual performance obligations
and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers
to a customer. The Company s revenue streams are recognized at a point in time for the Company s sale of health and wellness
products. 

The
ASU requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company
(i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction
price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate
the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies
the performance obligation. 

The
Company accounts for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed in writing, the rights of the parties, including payment
terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of substantially collection. 

Sales
of Skin Care, Health and Wellness products 

-
Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time 

The
Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when control of the health and wellness
products are transferred to its customer at the Company s office or shipment of the goods. The revenue is recorded net of estimated
discounts and return allowances. Products are given 60 days for returns or exchanges from the date of purchase. Historically, there were
insignificant sales returns. 

Under
the Company s network marketing business, the Company issues product coupons to members and distributors when these customers made
purchases above certain thresholds set by the Company. Depending on the type of product coupons issued, the coupons carry varying values
and can be used by the customers for reduction in the transaction price of product purchases within the coupon validity period. The value
of the product coupons issued is recorded as a reduction of the Company s revenue account upon issuance; the corresponding amount
credited to the customer deposits account. Amounts in customer deposits will be reversed when the coupons are used. The Company s
coupons have a validity period of between six and twelve months. If the Company s customers did not utilize the coupons after the
validity period, the Company would recognize the forfeiture of the originated sales value of the coupons as net revenues. 

Sales
of products for the provision of complementary health therapies 

- Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time 

Products
for the provision of complementary health therapies are predominantly Chinese herbs in different forms, processed or otherwise, for prescriptions
for treating non-communicable diseases. 

The
Company based on the health screening test report to prescribe the products for the provision of complementary health therapies, the
Company deliver the products to the customers during the consultation session. 

Provision
of Health and Wellness services 

-
 Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time 

The
Company carries out its Wellness program, where the Company s products are bundled with health screening test. The health screening
test is considered as separate performance obligations. The promises to deliver the health screening test report is separately identifiable,
which is evidenced by the fact that the Company provides separate services of delivering the health screening test report. 

The
Company based on the health screening test contracts with customers, establishes the selling price for the health screening test and
place order to the health screening center. The Company obtains control of the test report before they are delivered to the customers.
The Company analyze the test report, provides consultations to the customers, bundle it with the Company s products and services
depending on the customer s needs. 

The
Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with its customers with revenues being recognized when the test reports are completed
and delivered to its customers during the consultation session in person. 

11 

Fair
value of financial instruments 

The
accounting standard regarding fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements defines financial instruments and
requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. 

The
accounting standards define fair value, establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhance
disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follow: 

Level
 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level
 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
 are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments. 

Level
 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value. 

Financial
instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at face value or cost,
which approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization
and their current market rates of interest. 

Accounting
Standards Adopted in 2024 

In
March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01 Leases (Topic 842) Common Control Arrangements . This ASU provides guidance
in ASC Topic 842 that Leasehold improvements associated with common control leases should be (i) amortized by the lessee over the useful
life of the leasehold improvements to the common control group, regardless of the lease term, as long as the lessee controls the use
of the underlying asset through a lease, and (ii) accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment
to equity if and when the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset. The ASU 2023-01 is effective for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2023. The adoption of this accounting standard has no material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements for the nine months ended and as at September 30, 2024. 

The
adoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months
end and as at September 30, 2024. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates ASUs ). Management periodically reviews new accounting standards that are issued. 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures .
The ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant
segment expenses. The ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU
may have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The ASU 2023-09
requires companies to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items
that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed
by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). The ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU may
have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01 Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest
and Similar Awards . The ASU clarify how an entity determines whether a profits interest or similar award is within the scope of
Accounting Standards Codification ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, by adding illustrative guidance.
The guidance in ASU 2024-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and can be applied either retrospectively
to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements or prospectively to profits interest and similar awards granted
or modified on or after the date at which the entity first applies the amendments. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2024-01
is not expected to have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In
March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02 Codification Improvements Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements .
The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance, but in most instances the references
removed are extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance. Generally, the amendments in ASU 2024-02 are not intended
to result in significant accounting changes for most entities. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2024 and are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

Except
for the above-mentioned pronouncements, there are no other new recent issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on
the consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.

ITEM
3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Foreign
exchange risk . Substantially most of our revenues are denominated in the Malaysian Ringgit while most of our expenses are denominated
in Malaysian Ringgit, U.S. dollar and Hong Kong Dollar. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange
risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments. Although in general,
our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited, the value of an investment in our Common Stock may be affected by the foreign
exchange rate between U.S. dollar and Malaysian Ringgit; and U.S. dollar and Hong Kong Dollar because the value of our business is effectively
denominated in Malaysian Ringgit and Hong Kong Dollar, while the Common Stock is traded in U.S. dollars. 

Credit
risk . Financial instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes
the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively
short collection terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for expected credit loss based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. 

ITEM
4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of the period covered by this Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based on the foregoing evaluation,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below. 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer and effected by the company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

13 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on such evaluation, the Company s management, including
our chief executive and chief financial officer, concluded that, during the period covered by this Report, internal controls and procedures
over financial reporting were not effective. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls
over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

Identified
Material Weakness 

A
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

Management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer identified the following material weakness during its assessment of
internal controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024: 

(i)
insufficient full-time personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to monitor the daily recording of transactions,
address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP; (ii)
lack of a functional internal audit department or personnel that monitors the consistencies of the preventive internal control procedures
and lack of adequate policies and procedures in internal audit function to ensure that the Company s policies and procedures have
been carried out as planned. 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we will prepare written
policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC
guidelines, to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions, including
equity and debt transactions. 

To
further strengthen the Company s internal controls, we plan to initiate the following measures going forward: 

1. 
 We
 intend to establish an internal audit function with assessment of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance requirements and improvement of overall
 internal control. 

2. 
 Once
 we hire additional employees, we intend to initiate a comprehensive training program and development plan to provide ongoing company-wide
 trainings regarding internal control and requirements of U.S. GAAP financial statements and related disclosures, with particular
 emphasis on our accounting staff. 

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the mid of fiscal year 2025. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

Except
as disclosed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024,
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
