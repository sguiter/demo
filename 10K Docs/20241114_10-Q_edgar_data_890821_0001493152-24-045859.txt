as of September 30, 2024, and further
losses are anticipated in the development of its business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has operating cash
outflows of and had a loss from operations of . Being a research and development company, since inception, the Company
has not yet generated revenue and the Company has incurred continuing losses from its operations. The Company s operations have
been funded principally through the issuance of equity. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In
assessing the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and its ability to generate
sufficient cash flow in the future to support its operating and capital expenditure commitments. At September 30, 2024, the Company had
cash of and working capital of . The Company s current cash on hand is not sufficient to satisfy its operating
cash needs for the 12 months from the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date the financial statements are issued.
Management s plan to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include raising additional working capital through public
or private equity or debt financings or other sources, the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park (see Note 7), subject to registration,
and may include additional collaborations with third parties as well as disciplined cash spending. Adequate additional financing may
not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Should the Company be unable to raise sufficient additional capital, the Company
may be required to undertake further cost-cutting measures including delaying or discontinuing certain operating activities. 

ENVERIC

 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

As
a result of these factors, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern for a period of one year after the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The
Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

Inflation
Risks 

The
Company considers the current inflationary trend existing in the North American economic environment reasonably likely to have a material
unfavorable impact on results of continuing operations. Higher rates of price inflation, as compared to recent prior levels of price
inflation, have caused a general increase in the cost of labor and materials. In addition, there is an increased risk of the Company
experiencing labor shortages due to a potential inability to attract and retain human resources due to increased labor costs resulting
from the current inflationary environment. 

Nasdaq
Notice 

On
November 21, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq stating that as of September 30, 2023, the Company did not meet the minimum of in stockholders equity required for
continued listing pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). On February 6, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq, granting
the Company an extension to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement by May 20, 2024. On May 21, 2024,
the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it regained compliance with the minimum stockholders equity
requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq. 

On
May 16, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq s Listing Qualifications Department stating that because the closing bid
price for the Company s common stock listed on Nasdaq was below for 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer meets
the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ).
The Company received an initial period of 180 calendar days from May 16, 2024, or until November 12, 2024, to regain compliance with
the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and was unable to regain compliance during that time. The Company has applied for a second 180-day
compliance period. As of the date hereof, the Company has not heard whether it will be granted the second compliance period. The Company
anticipates conducting a reverse split during the first or second quarter of 2025 in order to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid
Price Requirement if the bid price of the Company s common stock fails to close at or above per share for a minimum of 10
consecutive business days prior the end of the second compliance period.

December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, shares of the Existing Warrants and Investment Options exercised were considered
issued as the Company had the enforceable right to the obtain the cash proceeds, which were in-transit, and the Holders were no longer
able to rescind the exercise election. Due to the beneficial ownership limitation provisions, shares of the Existing Warrants
and Investment Options exercised were initially unissued and held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until notice is received
from the Holder that the shares may be issued in compliance with such limitation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the

Lincoln
Park Equity Line 

On
November 3, 2023, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement and a registration rights agreement
(the Registration Rights Agreement ), with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC Lincoln Park ), pursuant to which
Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to million of the Company s common stock subject to certain limitations and satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. 

Under
the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln
Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to million of the Company s Common Stock (the Purchase Shares ).
However, such sales of Common Stock by the Company, if any, will be subject to important limitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement,
including limitations on number of shares that may be sold. Sales may occur from time to time, at the Company s sole discretion,
over the 24-month period commencing on the date that the conditions to Lincoln Park s purchase obligation set forth in the Purchase
Agreement are satisfied, including that a registration statement on Form S-1 covering the resale of the shares of the Company s
Common Stock that have been and may be issued to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement, which the Company has filed with the SEC
pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, is declared effective by the SEC and a final prospectus relating thereto is filed with
the SEC. As required under the Purchase Agreement, the Company registered a resale of shares of our common stock, plus the
 commitment shares, by Lincoln Park on a registration statement on Form S-1 dated November 8, 2023, which was declared effective
by the SEC on December 5, 2023. As of July 30, 2024, there were no remaining shares available to be issued in connection with this registration
statement. On September 4, 2024, the Company filed an amended Form S-1, which was declared effective by the SEC on September 11, 2024.
The amended Form S-1 registered an additional shares of common stock that are available to be issued to Lincoln Park in connection
with this agreement. 

Because
the purchase price per share to be paid by Lincoln Park for the shares of Common Stock that the Company may elect to sell to Lincoln
Park under the Purchase Agreement, if any, will fluctuate based on the market prices of the Company s Common Stock at the time
the Company elects to sell shares to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, if any, it is not possible for us to predict the
number of shares of Common Stock that the Company will sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement, the purchase price per share
that Lincoln Park will pay for shares purchased from us under the Purchase Agreement, or the aggregate gross proceeds that the Company
will receive from those purchases by Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.

Business
Overview 

We
are a biotechnology company dedicated to the development of novel neuroplastogenic small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of depression,
anxiety, and addiction disorders. Leveraging our unique discovery and development platform, the Psybrary , we have created a robust
intellectual property portfolio of new chemical entities for specific mental health indications. Our lead program, the EVM201 Series,
comprises next generation synthetic prodrugs of the active metabolite, psilocin. We are developing the first product from the EVM201
Series EB-002 for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. We are also advancing its second program, the EVM301 Series
 EB 003, a non-hallucinogenic neuroplastogen expected to offer a first-in-class, new approach to the treatment of difficult-to-address
mental health disorders, mediated by the promotion of neuroplasticity without also inducing hallucinations in the patient. 

Psychedelics 

We
have continued to pursue the development of MagicMed s proprietary library, the Psybrary which we believe will help us to
identify and develop the right drug candidates needed to address mental health challenges, including anxiety. We synthesize novel analogues
of serotonin using a mixture of chemistry and synthetic biology, resulting in the expansion of the Psybrary , which includes 15
patent families with over a million potential variations and hundreds of synthesized molecules. The Company has created over 1,200 novel
molecular compounds that are housed in the Psybrary . Our current focus is develop our lead molecules EB-002 and EB-003, a non-hallucinogenic
neuroplastogen, and to out-license other molecules from the Psybrary .

of 67,822 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities is due to the exercise of 122,000
of warrants on December 28, 2023, resulting in less warrants outstanding and re-valued at September 30, 2024, as well as, the change
in the closing price of Common Stock at the end of each period, as compared to the closing price of Common Stock at the beginning of
each period with a strong inverse relationship between changes in fair value of warrant liabilities and the trading price of Common Stock.

Change
in fair value of investment option liability the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in an expense of 501 as compared to
income of 562,715 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in fair value is due to the exercise of 1,000,000 investment
options on December 28, 2023, resulting in less investment options re-valued at September 30, 2024 and a significant decrease in the
Company s stock price for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

transfer and spin-off its cannabinoid clinical development pipeline assets to Akos Biosciences, Inc., and Delaware franchise taxes of
 246,144 partially offset by an increase in director fees of 107,186.

Research
and Development Expenses 

Our
research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,736,373 as compared to 5,531,436 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 with a decrease of 3,795,063, or approximately 69 . This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease salaries
and wages of 1,542,075, research costs of 1,056,511, product development costs of 532,063, CRO costs of 128,560 and the gain realized
related to the Australian R D tax incentive of 291,439. 

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation
and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 255,002 as compared to 259,300 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, with a decrease of 4,298, or approximately 2 . 

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 

Change
in fair value of warrant liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in income of 20,722 as compared to a loss
of 115,342 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities is due to the exercise of 122,000
of warrants on December 28, 2023, resulting in less warrants outstanding and re-valued at September 30, 2024, as well as, the change
in the closing price of Common Stock at the end of each period, as compared to the closing price of Common Stock at the beginning of
each period with a strong inverse relationship between changes in fair value of warrant liabilities and the trading price of Common Stock. 

Change
in Fair Value of Investment Option Liability 

Change
in fair value of investment option liability the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in income of 18,664 as compared to a
loss of 399,921 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in fair value is due to the exercise of 1,000,000 investment
options on December 28, 2023, resulting in less investment options re-valued at September 30, 2024 and a significant decrease in the
Company s stock price for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 

The
Company s change in fair value of derivative liability is due to the May 2023 redemption which ceased the probability of occurrence
of the Akos spin-off and Akos Series A Preferred Stock redemption. 

Going
Concern, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The
Company has incurred a loss since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of 102,919,859 as of September 30, 2024 and further
losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Further, the Company had operating cash outflows of 6,414,590 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a loss from operations of
 6,458,440. Since inception, being a research and development company, the Company has not yet generated revenue and the Company has
incurred continuing losses from its operations. The Company s operations have been funded principally through the issuance of
debt and equity. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period
of one year from the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In
assessing the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and its ability to generate
sufficient cash flow in the future to support its operating and capital expenditure commitments. At September 30, 2024, the Company had
cash of 3,111,683 and working capital of 3,499,093. The Company s current cash on hand is insufficient to satisfy its operating
cash needs for the 12 months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date the financial statements are issued.
Management s plan to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include raising additional working capital through public
or private equity or debt financings or other sources, and may include additional collaborations with third parties as well as disciplined
cash spending. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Should the Company be unable
to raise sufficient additional capital, the Company may be required to undertake cost-cutting measures including delaying or discontinuing
certain operating activities. 

25 

As
a result of these factors, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern for a period of one year after the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Cash
Flows 

Since
inception, we have primarily used our available cash to fund our product development and operations expenditures. 

Cash
Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates,
assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Our critical
accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes
in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly,
actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Our most critical accounting estimate includes
determining the accruals associated with third party providers supporting research and development efforts. 

26 

There
have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Our
primary market risk exposure is foreign currency exchange risk. From inception through September 30, 2024, the Company s reporting
currency is the United States dollar while the functional currency of certain of the Company s subsidiaries is the Canadian dollar
and Australian dollar. For the reporting periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company engaged in a number of
transactions denominated in Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. As a result, the Company is subject to exposure from changes in
the exchange rates of the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. 

The
Company has not entered into any financial derivative instruments that expose it to material market risk, including any instruments designed
to hedge the impact of foreign currency exposures. The Company may, however, hedge such exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations
in the future. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified under the rules and
forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The matters that management identified in our Annual
Report for the year ended December 31, 2023, continued to exist and were still considered material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting at September 30, 2024. 

As
required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive) and
Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, and in light
of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in paragraph (e) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act)
were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Management s
Remediation Plan 

As
previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, management had concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023, because management identified inadequate segregation of duties
to ensure the processing, review, and authorization of all transactions, including non-routine transactions resulting in deficiencies,
which, in aggregate, amounted to a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

As
of September 30, 2024, there were control deficiencies that constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
Management has taken, and is taking steps to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting: we have conducted evaluation of
the material weakness to determine the appropriate remedy and have established procedures for documenting disclosures and disclosure
controls. 

27 

While
we have taken certain actions to address the material weaknesses identified, additional measures may be necessary as we work to improve
the overall effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the changes discussed above in the Company s remediation plan, there have been no other changes in our internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during quarter ending September 30,
2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

The
Company may be periodically involved in legal proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We do
not have any pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024 and the Company s Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on May 15, 2024 and August 12, 2024,
respectively. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations of financial
condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results
of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, other than as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk
factors disclosed in the Company s Annual Report. 

In
the event that we fail to regain compliance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market or satisfy any of the listing
requirements of Nasdaq, our common stock may be delisted, which could affect our market price and liquidity. 

Our
common stock is listed on Nasdaq. For continued listing on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with the continued listing requirements,
including the minimum market capitalization standard, the stockholders equity requirement, the corporate governance requirements
and the minimum closing bid price requirement, among other requirements. On May 16, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing
Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market stating that because the closing bid price for the Company s common stock
listed on Nasdaq was below 1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement for
continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). The Company received an initial period of 180 calendar days from May 16, 2024, or until November 12, 2024, to regain
compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and was unable to regain compliance during that time. The Company has applied for a
second 180-day compliance period. As of the date hereof, the Company has not heard whether it will be granted the second compliance period.
The Company anticipates conducting a reverse split during the first or second quarter of 2025 in order to regain compliance with the Minimum
Bid Price Requirement if the bid price of the Company s common stock fails to close at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of
10 consecutive business days prior the end of the second compliance period. 

In
the event that we fail to receive a second compliance period, or to otherwise regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price
Requirement or satisfy any of the listing requirements of Nasdaq, our common stock may be delisted. We will have an opportunity to
appeal the determination to a Hearings Panel, but we cannot guarantee that such appeal will be successful. If we are unable to list
on Nasdaq, we would likely be more difficult to trade in or obtain accurate quotations as to the market price of our common stock.
If our common stock is delisted from trading on Nasdaq, and we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange or to have
it quoted on Nasdaq, our securities could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the pink sheets. As a result, we
could face significant adverse consequences including, without limitation: 

a
 limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

28 

a
 determination that our common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers
 trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced
 level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a
 limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our Company; and 

a
 decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form registration
 statements on Form S-3 or obtain additional financing in the future).
