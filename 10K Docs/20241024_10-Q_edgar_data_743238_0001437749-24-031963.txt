See "Note 4 Debt " for further information about the chassis pool agreements. 

of the outstanding membership interests of ITU Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary Independent Truck Upfitters, LLC (collectively ITU for cash consideration of and up to an additional earn-out amount subject to meeting certain performance criteria within the first two years after the acquisition. The purchase price was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility. ITU is a Midwest-based provider of turnkey upfit services for fleets of commercial and government service vehicles . We recorded pretax charges totaling and during the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, for legal expenses and other transaction costs related to the acquisition, which were reported in Selling, general and administrative expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. ITU is part of our Specialty Vehicle segment. 
 
 The ITU acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with the purchase price allocated to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships, backlog, trade names and trademarks, unpatented technology and non-competition agreements. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired of was recorded as goodwill, which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of the net assets acquired were based on a preliminary valuation and the estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. 
 
 The preliminary purchase price was comprised of the following: 

Fair value of contingent consideration 
 Total preliminary purchase price 

The Company recorded a current and a non-current contingent consideration liability for the earn-out at a fair value of and , respectively, as of the acquisition date. The fair value was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation to model the likelihood of achieving the agreed-upon performance criteria based on available information as of the acquisition date. The valuation methodology includes assumptions and judgments regarding the discount rate, estimated probability of achieving the performance criteria, and expected timing of payments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the preliminary purchase price allocation to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows: 

Accounts receivable, less allowance 
 Contract assets 
 Inventory 
 Other current assets 
 Property, plant and equipment 
 Right of use assets-operating leases 
 Other assets 
 Intangible assets 
 Goodwill 
 Total assets acquired 
 
 Accounts payable 
 Contract liabilities 
 Operating lease liabilities 
 Other current liabilities and accrued expenses 
 Long-term operating lease liability 
 Total liabilities assumed 
 Total fair value allocation of preliminary purchase price 

Intangible assets totaling have provisionally been assigned to customer relationships, backlog, trade names and trademarks, unpatented technology and non-competition agreements as a result of the acquisition and consist of the following (in thousands): 
 
 13 Years 
 Backlog 1 Year 
 Trade names and trademarks 6 Years 
 Unpatented technology 10 Years 
 Non-competition agreements 5 Years 

The Company amortizes the customer relationships utilizing an accelerated approach and amortizes backlog, trade names and trademarks, unpatented technology and non-competition agreement assets utilizing a straight-line approach. Amortization expense was for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Goodwill consists of operational synergies that are expected to be realized in both the short and long-term and the opportunity to enter into new markets which will enable us to increase value to our customers and shareholders. Key areas of expected cost savings include an expanded dealer network, complementary product portfolios and manufacturing and supply chain work process improvements. 
 
 Due to its insignificant size relative to the Company, supplemental pro forma financial information of the combined entity for the prior reporting period is not provided.

Chassis Pool Agreements 
 
 The Company obtains certain vehicle chassis for its walk-in vans, service bodies and specialty vehicles directly from the chassis manufacturers under converter pool agreements. Chassis are obtained from the manufacturers based on orders from customers, and in some cases, for unallocated orders. The agreements generally state that the manufacturer will provide a supply of chassis to be maintained at the Company s facilities with the condition that we will store such chassis and will not move, sell, or otherwise dispose of such chassis except under the terms of the agreement. In addition, the manufacturer typically retains the sole authority to authorize commencement of work on the chassis and to make certain other decisions with respect to the chassis including the terms and pricing of sales of the chassis to the manufacturer s dealers. The manufacturer also does not transfer the certificate of origin to the Company nor permit the Company to sell or transfer the chassis to anyone other than the manufacturer (for ultimate resale to a dealer). 
 
 Although the Company is party to related finance agreements with manufacturers, the Company has not historically settled related obligations in cash, except as required under our credit agreement. The obligation is usually settled by the manufacturer upon reassignment of the chassis to an accepted dealer, and the dealer is invoiced for the chassis by the manufacturer. The Company has included this financing agreement on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within Other receivables chassis pool agreements and Short-term debt chassis pool agreements . Typically, chassis are converted and delivered to customers within 90 days of the receipt of the chassis by the Company. The chassis converter pool is a non-cash arrangement and is offsetting between Current assets and Current liabilities on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Long-term debt consists of the following: 

Finance lease obligation 
 Total debt 
 Less current portion of long-term debt 
 Total long-term debt 

Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 On November 30, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among us and certain of our subsidiaries as borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto consisting of Wells Fargo, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., PNC Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. (the "Lenders"). Certain of our other subsidiaries have executed guaranties guarantying the borrowers' obligations under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 On March 27, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) reduced the revolving credit commitments from to , (ii) increased the applicable margin for term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") loans and base rate loans, (iii) adjusted the calculation of debt for purposes of determining the leverage ratio and (iv) temporarily increased the maximum leverage ratio through June 30, 2024. 
 
 Under the Credit Agreement, we may borrow up to from the Lenders under a secured revolving credit facility, which matures November 30, 2026. We may also request an increase in the facility of up to in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The revolving credit facility is also available for the issuance of letters of credit of up to and swing line loans of up to , subject to certain limitations and restrictions. The revolving credit facility carries an interest rate of either (i) the highest of prime rate, the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus , or the one month adjusted SOFR including a credit spread adjustment plus 1.50 ; or (ii) adjusted SOFR, in each case plus a margin based upon our ratio of debt to earnings from time to time. The applicable borrowing rate including the margin was (or one -month SOFR including a credit spread adjustment plus at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The revolving credit facility is secured by security interests in, and liens on, all assets of the borrowers and guarantors, other than real property and certain other excluded assets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling and , respectively, related to our workers compensation insurance. 
 
 Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, available borrowings (exclusive of outstanding borrowings) totaled and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial covenants; prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness; limits certain acquisitions, investments, advances or loans; limits our ability to pay dividends in certain circumstances; and restricts substantial asset sales, all subject to certain exceptions and baskets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our Credit Agreement.

Legal Proceedings Relating to Environmental Matters 
 
 As previously disclosed, in May 2020, the Company received an information request from the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA requesting certain information regarding emissions labels on chassis, vocational vehicles, and vehicles that the Company manufactured or imported into the U.S. between January 1, 2017 to the date the Company received the request in May 2020. The Company responded to the EPA s request and furnished the requested materials in the third quarter of 2020. 
 
 On April 6, 2022, the Company received a Notice of Violation from the EPA alleging a failure to secure certain certifications on manufactured chassis and a failure to comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to supplier-provided chassis. 
 
 On September 27, 2024, the Company received the final approval from the EPA to settle this matter for . We had an accrual of as of September 30, 2024 and paid the settlement in full in October of 2024.

The tax expense (benefit) represented a and effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively 
 
 The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differs from the U.S. statutory rate of primarily due to the tax benefit of research credits partially offset by state tax expense and non-deductible officer compensation and a discrete tax expense in 2024 related to the difference in stock compensation expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes upon vesting. The tax benefit rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is additionally affected by a discrete tax benefit for a 2022 return-to-provision adjustment for the research credit.

Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The Shyft Group, Inc. was organized as a Michigan corporation and is headquartered in Novi, Michigan. We are a niche market leader in specialty vehicle manufacturing and assembly for the commercial vehicle (including last-mile delivery, specialty service and vocation-specific upfit) and recreational vehicle industries. Our products include walk-in vans, truck bodies, cargo van and pick-up truck upfits used in e-commerce/parcel delivery, upfit equipment used in the utility trades, as well as luxury Class A diesel motorhome custom chassis and contract manufacturing and assembly services. We also supply replacement parts and offer repair, maintenance, field service and refurbishment services for the vehicles that we manufacture. 
 
 Our vehicles, parts and services are sold to commercial users, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), dealers, individual end users, and municipalities and other governmental entities. Our diversification across several sectors provides numerous opportunities while reducing overall risk as the various markets we serve tend to have different cyclicality. We have an innovative team focused on building lasting relationships with our customers by designing and delivering market leading specialty vehicles, vehicle components, and services. Additionally, our business structure provides agility to quickly respond to market needs, take advantage of strategic opportunities when they arise and correctly size and scale operations to ensure stability and growth. 
 
 We believe we can best carry out our long-term business plan and obtain optimal financial flexibility by using a combination of borrowings under our credit facilities, as well as internally or externally generated equity capital, as sources of expansion capital. 
 
 Executive Overview 

Sales of 194.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3.6 compared to 201.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. 

Gross margin of 20.4 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 18.3 for the third quarter of 2023. 

Operating expense of 34.3 million, or 17.7 of sales for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 32.6 million, or 16.2 of sales for the third quarter of 2023. 

Operating income of 5.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. 

Income tax benefit of 0.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. 

Net income of 3.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 4.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. 

Diluted earnings per share of 0.09 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 0.13 for the third quarter of 2023. 

Order backlog of 345.4 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 119.0 million or 25.6 from our backlog of 464.4 million at September 30, 2023. 

We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of long-term opportunities and continue our efforts to bring product innovations to each of the markets that we serve. Some of our recent innovations, strategic developments and strengths include: 

Acquired Independent Truck Upfitters ITU ), a Midwest-based provider of vocational service body upfit for commercial fleets and government service vehicles, on July 24, 2024 for cash consideration of 50.9 million and up to an additional 8.0 million earn-out amount. The ITU acquisition aligns with our growth strategy by expanding our service body product offerings and upfit capabilities. This transaction provides unique synergies and cross-selling opportunities with current products, adds a chassis pool and increases ship-thru capability to support future growth. ITU is part of our Specialty Vehicle segment. 

In March 2022, we announced Blue Arc Electric Vehicle EV Solutions. Leveraging a scalable, commercial grade, purpose built design, the full Blue Arc EV offering will include Class 3, 4 and 5 walk-in van configurations with body length options from 12 to 22 feet. Designed for last-mile delivery fleets, these vehicles will be powered by lithium-ion battery packs that can deliver over 150 mile range at 50 payload. We expect Shyft customers can maximize productivity and minimize cost of ownership, including fuel and maintenance costs with our Blue Arc EV product offering. 

The Velocity lineup of last-mile delivery vehicles span Gross Vehicle Weight Rating class sizes 2 and 3 and are available on Ford Transit, Mercedes Sprinter, and RAM Promaster chassis. The Velocity combines fuel efficiency, comfort, and maneuverability with the cargo space, access, and load capacity similar to a traditional walk-in van. 

Royal Truck Body s Severe Duty body, built to fit General Motors medium duty truck class and Ford's Super Duty truck class, includes more standard features than any other service body on the market. With its fortress five-point lock system, 10-gauge steel box tops treated with a protective Polyurea coating and 3/8 tread plate steel floors, this work truck is built to last and is ideal for contractors and business owners that need heavy-duty work trucks.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Sales 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported consolidated sales of 194.1 million, compared to 201.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 7.2 million or 3.6 . This decrease is driven by lower sales volumes in our Fleet Vehicles and Services FVS segment attributed to lower sales volumes of truck bodies including lower USPS pass-through chassis sales, partially offset by higher upfit sales and higher sales in our Specialty Vehicles SV segment attributed to higher service body sales and the contribution of the ITU acquisition. 
 
 Cost of Products Sold 
 
 Cost of products sold was 154.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 164.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 10.1 million or 6.1 . The decrease was due to 9.1 million in lower volume and mix including impact of the ITU acquisition and 6.0 million in lower pass-through chassis costs, partially offset by 5.0 million higher manufacturing and other costs. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit was 39.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 36.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 2.8 million or 7.7 . The increase was due to 6.8 million of favorable product mix, partially offset by 4.0 million in higher manufacturing and other costs.

The consolidated backlog at September 30, 2024 totaled 345.4 million, a decrease of 119.0 million, or 25.6 , compared to 464.4 million at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Our FVS backlog decreased by 115.5 million, or 30.1 , primarily due to vehicle sales and softer demand in delivery vans. Our SV segment backlog decreased by 3.5 million, or 4.4 , across product lines, partially offset by added backlog from the acquisition of ITU. 
 
 Orders in the backlog are subject to modification, cancellation or rescheduling by customers. Although the backlog of unfilled orders is one of many indicators of market demand, several factors, such as changes in production rates, available capacity, new product introductions, supply of chassis, and competitive pricing actions, may affect actual sales. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period-to-period is not necessarily indicative of eventual actual shipments. 
 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 This report presents Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP measure is calculated by excluding items that we believe to be infrequent or not indicative of our underlying operating performance, as well as certain non-cash expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to eliminate the impact of restructuring charges, acquisition related expenses and adjustments, non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and other gains and losses not reflective of our ongoing operations. 
 
 We present the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA enables investors to better understand our operations by removing items that we believe are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We believe this measure to be useful to improve the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors, as well as to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not indicative of our continuing operating performance. 
 
 We believe that presenting this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our historical performance. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to that measure, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained in the absence of this disclosure. 
 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to our segments. Adjusted EBITDA is also used, along with other financial and non-financial measures, for purposes of determining annual incentive compensation for our management team and long-term incentive compensation for certain members of our management team.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased by 11.5 million from December 31, 2023, to a balance of 21.4 million as of September 30, 2024. These funds, in addition to cash generated from future operations and availability under our existing credit facility, are expected to be sufficient to finance our foreseeable liquidity and capital needs, including potential future acquisitions. 
 
 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 
 We generated 17.2 million of cash from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in cash provided of 27.6 million from 44.8 million of cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 17.2 million of cash provided in the first nine months of 2024 was driven by a 20.9 million net inflow related to income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations, partially offset by a 3.7 million net outflow related to the change in net working capital. The change in working capital in the first nine months of 2024 was driven by a 21.5 million net outflow related to decreased payables primarily attributable to payment timing and lower purchasing volume, partially offset by a 7.5 million net inflow driven by changes in accounts receivable and contract assets, 6.9 million net inflow related to decreased inventories, and a 3.7 million net inflow related to accrued compensation and related taxes. 
 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 
 We used 60.0 million in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in cash used of 43.5 million from 16.5 million used during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to a 48.1 million increase in cash used to acquire ITU, partially offset by 4.7 million decrease in the purchases of property, plant and equipment. 
 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 
 We generated 54.3 million of cash through financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in cash provided of 84.2 million from 29.9 million used during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to 35.0 million of increased proceeds from long-term debt driven by the acquisition of ITU for 50.9 million, 26.0 million of decreased payments on long-term debt, a 19.1 million decrease in the purchase and retirement of common stock, and 4.0 million decrease in the exercising and vesting of stock incentive awards. 
 
 Debt 
 
 On November 30, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among us and certain of our subsidiaries as borrowers, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto consisting of Wells Fargo, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., PNC Bank, N.A., National Association and Bank of America, N.A. (the "Lenders"). Certain of our other subsidiaries have executed guaranties guarantying the borrowers' obligations under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 On March 27, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) reduced the revolving credit commitments from 400.0 million to 300.0 million, (ii) increased the applicable margin for term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") loans and base rate loans, (iii) adjusted the calculation of debt for purposes of determining the leverage ratio and (iv) temporarily increased the maximum leverage ratio through June 30, 2024. 
 
 Under the Credit Agreement, we may borrow up to 300.0 million from the Lenders under a secured revolving credit facility which matures November 30, 2026. We may also request an increase in the facility of up to 200.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The revolving credit facility is also available for the issuance of letters of credit of up to 20.0 million and swing line loans of up to 15.0 million, subject to certain limitations and restrictions. The revolving credit facility carries an interest rate of either (i) the highest of prime rate, the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5 , or the one month adjusted SOFR including a credit spread adjustment plus 1.50 ; or (ii) adjusted SOFR, in each case plus a margin based upon our ratio of debt to earnings from time to time. The applicable borrowing rate including the margin was 6.45 (or one-month SOFR including a credit spread adjustment plus 1.50 at September 30, 2024.

The revolving credit facility is secured by security interests in, and liens on, all assets of the borrowers and guarantors, other than real property and certain other excluded assets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 1.9 million and 1.6 million, respectively, related to our workers compensation insurance. 
 
 Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, available borrowings (exclusive of outstanding borrowings) totaled 34.1 million and 83.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial covenants; prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness; limits certain acquisitions, investments, advances or loans; limits our ability to pay dividends in certain circumstances; and restricts substantial asset sales, all subject to certain exceptions and baskets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our Credit Agreement. 
 
 Equity Securities 
 
 On February 17, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 250.0 million of our common stock in open market transactions. We believe that we have sufficient resources to fund potential stock buybacks in which we may engage. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 The amounts or timing of any dividends are subject to earnings, financial condition, liquidity, capital requirements and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. We declared dividends on our outstanding common shares in 2024 and 2023 as shown in the table below.

Effect of Inflation 
 
 Inflation affects us in two principal ways. First, our revolving credit facility is generally tied to the Prime and SOFR interest rates so that increases in those interest rates would be translated into additional interest expense. Second, general inflation impacts prices paid for labor, parts and supplies. Whenever possible, we attempt to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of our products. However, we generally do not attempt to negotiate inflation-based price adjustment provisions into our contracts. We have limited ability to pass on cost increases to our customers on a short-term basis. In addition, the markets we serve are competitive in nature, and competition limits our ability to pass through cost increases in many cases. We strive to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity. Refer to the Commodities Risk section in Item 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding commodity cost fluctuations.

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and the effect of such a change on outstanding variable rate short-term and long-term debt. At September 30, 2024, we had 110.0 million debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility. An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in 1.1 million of incremental interest expense on an annualized basis. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources to accommodate this hypothetical increase in interest rates. We do not enter into market-risk-sensitive instruments for trading or other purposes. 
 
 Commodities Risk 
 
 We are also exposed to changes in the prices of raw materials, primarily steel and aluminum, along with components that are made from these raw materials. We generally do not enter into derivative instruments for the purpose of managing exposures associated with fluctuations in steel and aluminum prices. We do, from time to time, engage in pre-buys of components that are impacted by changes in steel, aluminum and other commodity prices in order to mitigate our exposure to such price increases and align our costs with prices quoted in specific customer orders. We also actively manage our material supply sourcing and may employ various methods to limit risk associated with commodity cost fluctuations due to normal market conditions and other factors including tariffs. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part 1, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on the impacts of changes in input costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We do not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the primary market risk exposures or in the particular markets that present our primary risk of loss. As of the date of this report, we do not know of or expect any material changes in the general nature of our primary market risk exposure in the near term. In this discussion, near term means a period of one year following the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Prevailing interest rates, interest rate relationships and commodity costs are primarily determined by market factors that are beyond our control. All information provided in response to this item consists of forward-looking statements. Reference is made to the section captioned Forward-Looking Statements before Part I of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of the limitations on our responsibility for such statements.

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 On July 24, 2024, The Shyft Group, Inc. acquired Independent Truck Upfitters ("ITU"). We are currently integrating policies, processes, and operations for the combined company. The acquired operations are excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as permissible under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 Except as described above regarding the acquisition and integration of ITU, there have been no changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 An effective internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or overriding of controls, and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to reliable financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.
