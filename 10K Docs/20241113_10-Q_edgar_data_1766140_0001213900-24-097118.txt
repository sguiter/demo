Unicycive Therapeutics, Inc. 

Notes to the Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

. The Company was dormant until July 2017 when it began evaluating a number
of drug candidates for in-licensing. 

In September 2018, the Company purchased a second
drug candidate, Renazorb RZB 012 and its trademark, RENALAN, and various patents from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Spectrum (Note 3). Renazorb oxylanthanum carbonate is being developed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease CKD ). 

In 2017, the Company in-licensed the drug candidate UNI 494 from Sphaera
Pharma Pte. Ltd, a Singapore-based corporation, Sphaera (Note 3). UNI 494 is a pro-drug of nicorandil that is being developed
as a treatment for acute kidney injury. 

The Company continues to evaluate the licensing
of additional technologies and drugs, targeting orphan diseases and other renal, liver and other metabolic diseases affecting fibrosis
and inflammation. 

Liquidity 

The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties
common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological
innovations, protection of proprietary technology, dependence on key personnel, compliance with governmental regulations and the need
to obtain additional financing to fund operations. The Company s product candidates currently under development will require significant
additional research and development efforts prior to commercialization. Future revenue streams may consist of collaboration or licensing
revenue as well as product sales. The Company has not generated any licensing revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company has incurred operating losses and
negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects to continue to incur negative cash flows from operations in the future.
As the Company increases its research and development activities, the operating losses are expected to increase. The Company has historically
relied on private equity offerings, debt financing and loans from a stockholder to fund its operations. As of December 31, 2023 and September
30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million and million, respectively. 

In connection with its initial public offering IPO ), on July 13, 2021, the Company began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol UNCY , and
on July 15, 2021, received approximately million in net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discounts, commissions and other
offering expenses. The Company has used the net proceeds from the IPO to complete pre-clinical and clinical studies, prepare regulatory
filings for the FDA, and for general and corporate purposes, including hiring additional management and conducting market research and
other commercial planning. 

On March 3, 2023, the Company entered into a
securities purchase agreement with certain healthcare-focused institutional investors that may provide up to million in gross
proceeds through a private placement and that included initial upfront funding of million in net proceeds. 

On March 13, 2024, the Company entered into a
securities purchase agreement with certain healthcare-focused institutional investors to provide million in gross proceeds through
a private placement. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the Company issued institutional investors million in shares
of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company received million in net proceeds (net of issuance costs). 

The Company expects to continue incurring losses
in the future and will be required to raise additional capital in the future to complete its planned clinical trials, pursue product
development initiatives and penetrate markets for the sale of its products. Management believes that the Company will continue to have
access to capital resources through possible equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means. There can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, on a timely basis or at
all. If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, it may be required to curtail any clinical trials and development of new
or existing products and take additional measures to reduce expenses in order to conserve its cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations
and meet its obligations. Based on the Company s current level of expenditures, the Company believes that it has sufficient resources
such that there is not substantial doubt about the ability to continue operations for at least one year after the date that these financial
statements are available to be issued.

likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing
authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that
a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. The Company s policy is to recognize
interest or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.

will be due commencing with the initiation by the Company
of a second clinical trial and on completion of such trial. If the FDA accepts a NDA application submitted by the Company for
the product, the Company will pay Sphaera million. Upon commercialization and sale of the drug product, royalty payments will also
be payable quarterly to Sphaera equal to of net sales on the preceding quarter. 

11 

shares of common stock to Spectrum valued at approximately 
which represented four percent of the Company on a fully-diluted basis at the date of the execution of the Spectrum Agreement. The Spectrum
Agreement has an anti-dilution provision, which provides that Spectrum maintain its ownership interest in the Company at of the Company s
shares on a fully-diluted basis. Fully-diluted shares of common stock for purposes of the oxylanthanum carbonate Purchase Agreement assumes
conversion of any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock or any combination thereof, including any
common stock reserved for issuance under a stock option plan, restricted stock plan, or other equity incentive plan approved by the Board
of Directors of the Company immediately following the issuance of additional shares of the Company s common stock (but prior to
the issuance of any additional shares of common stock to Spectrum). Spectrum s ownership shall not be subject to dilution until
the earlier of thirty-six months from the first date the Company s stock trades on a public market, or the date upon which the
Company attains a public market capitalization of at least million. On July 13, 2021, the Company s initial public offering
resulted in a public market capitalization of at least million, and as a result the Company was required to issue anti-dilution
shares of common stock. This issuance represented the final anti-dilution calculation required under the Spectrum Agreement, and no further
anti-dilution shares will be issued. The Company calculated the fair value of the shares and recognized million to research and
development expenses as cost to issue those shares during the third quarter of 2021. In the event an NDA filing for oxylanthanum carbonate
is accepted by the FDA, the Company will be required to pay million to Altair Nanomaterials, Inc., Altair in accordance
with the Spectrum Agreement. In addition, in the event FDA approval for oxylanthanum carbonate is received, the Company will be required
to pay million to Altair. The Company is also required to pay Spectrum of all the Company s sublicense income for any
sublicense granted to certain sublicensees during the first 12 months after the Closing Date (as that term is defined in the Spectrum
Agreement) and of all other sublicense income. The Company s payment obligations to Spectrum will expire on the twentieth (20th)
anniversary of the Closing Date of the Spectrum Agreement. In August 2022, the Company received an upfront payment of approximately 
million resulting from a sublicense development agreement with Lee s Pharmaceutical (HK) Limited. In February 2023, the Company
received an upfront payment of approximately million resulting from a sublicense development agreement with Lotus International
Pte Ltd. The payment represents sublicense income as described in the Spectrum Agreement, and of the amount received has been accrued
as an R D expense in the accompanying statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

On July 19, 2021, the Company entered into an
agreement with Syneos Health LLC Syneos pursuant to which Syneos will provide preclinical research and analysis services
related to the development of UNI-494. The initial budget for the study, which includes clinical pharmacology, translational sciences,
and bioanalytical services, was approximately million. Approximately million has been paid to Syneos and the research was completed
during 2023. 

On January 6, 2022, the Company entered into
a Master Services Agreement with Quotient Sciences Limited Quotient ), a UK based company that provides drug development
and analysis services, for the purpose of performing clinical research in support of UNI-494. The initial budget for the study is
approximately million, and subsequent revisions reduced the overall budget to million. Related payments totaling approximately
 million have been paid to Quotient as of September 30, 2024, approximately million of related expense has been recorded, and
approximately million and million has been recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying balance
sheets as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. 

On February 9, 2022, the Company entered into
a Master Services Agreement with CBCC Global Research Inc. CBCC ), a California based company that provides clinical trial
and related services, for the purpose of performing clinical research in support of oxylanthanum carbonate. The budget for the initial
study was approximately million. Payments relating to the initial agreement totaling approximately million have been paid to
CBCC as of March 31, 2023, and approximately million of related expense has been recorded. In September 2022, a statement of work

paid to Celerion as of December 31, 2023, and the research was completed during 2023. 

On February 1, 2023, the Company entered into
a license agreement with Lotus International Pte Ltd. Lotus (see Note 4). Under the terms of the agreement, Lotus will
be responsible for development, registration filing and approval for oxylanthanum carbonate in the licensed territory of South Korea.
In addition, Lotus will have sole responsibility for the importation of the drug product from the Company and for the costs of commercialization
of oxylanthanum carbonate in the licensed territory. The Company has received an upfront payment of million, may receive up to 
million in future milestone payments and will be eligible for tiered royalties upon achievement of specified commercial achievements. 

On June 29, 2023 and October 26, 2023, the Company
entered into services agreements with Shilpa Medicare Ltd related to NDA filing support for oxylanthanum carbonate. The agreements provide
for total payments of up to million, and the Company has made million in payments pursuant to the agreements as of September
30, 2024. 

million, expects to receive up
to million in milestone payments upon product launch in China and will be eligible for tiered royalties of between and upon
achievement of prespecified regulatory and commercial achievements. 

The Company has evaluated the Lee s Agreement
in accordance with ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ASC 808 and ASC 606. The Company first assessed whether
the contractual arrangement is within the scope of ASC 808 which defines a collaborative arrangement as a contractual arrangement that
involves a joint operating activity. Under ASC 606, the counterparty is considered a customer only if it is acquiring goods or services
that are an output of the entity s ordinary activities . The Lee s Agreement is consistent with the Company s
current ongoing operations, which is an operating model adopted by many early-stage biotech companies. The license portion of the contract
as well as the future potential transactions under a manufacturing and supply agreement both represent a vendor-customer relationship. 

The Company does not believe that its promise
to provide goods under a future manufacturing and supply agreement represents a material right to Lee s, and therefore the promise
does not represent a current performance obligation. The Company has concluded the agreement contains one performance obligation 
the IP license. 

ASC 606 indicates that constrained variable consideration
should be included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative
revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Variable
considerations consisting of milestone payments and sales-based royalties may be received based on the completion of certain clinical,
regulatory, and commercial activities. The Company has concluded that the future milestone payments should be excluded from the transaction
price due to the uncertainty of achievement as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. The Company will reassess this conclusion
at each reporting date until the uncertainties are resolved.

million upfront fee. 

The Company has concluded that the license of
the oxylanthanum carbonate IP is functional IP as it contains all the necessary information for Lee s to develop for commercialization
in the Territory. Unicycive s ongoing activities do not significantly affect the standalone functionality of the IP. In addition,
the functionality of the IP is not expected to substantially change during the license period based on Unicycive s activities.
The revenue should therefore be recognized at a point in time. This intellectual property was transferred to Lee s in July 2022. 

On February 1, 2023, the Company entered into
a license agreement (the Lotus Agreement with Lotus International Pte Ltd. Lotus ). Under the terms of the
agreement, Lotus will be responsible for development, registration filing and approval for oxylanthanum carbonate in the licensed territory
of South Korea. In addition, Lotus will have sole responsibility for the importation of the drug product from the Company and for the
costs of commercialization of oxylanthanum carbonate in the licensed territory. The Company has agreed to complete development of the
drug product, at its own expense, as required for obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S. Both parties agreed to enter into a separate
manufacturing and supply agreement whereby Unicycive will supply Lotus with oxylanthanum carbonate product. The Company has received
an upfront payment of million, may receive up to million in future milestone payments and will be eligible for tiered royalties
upon achievement of specified commercial achievements. 

The Company has evaluated the Lotus Agreement
in accordance with ASC 808 and ASC 606. The Company first assessed whether the contractual arrangement is within the scope of ASC 808
which defines a collaborative arrangement as a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity. Under ASC 606, the counterparty
is considered a customer only if it is acquiring goods or services that are an output of the entity s ordinary activities .
The Lotus Agreement is consistent with the Company s current ongoing operations, which is an operating model adopted by many early-stage
biotech companies. The license portion of the contract as well as the future potential transactions under a manufacturing and supply
agreement both represent a vendor-customer relationship. 

The Company does not believe that its promise
to provide goods under a future manufacturing and supply agreement represents a material right to Lotus, and therefore the promise does
not represent a current performance obligation. The Company evaluated the development services and concluded that although not material
in cost, they are highly interrelated with the license grant. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to
combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.
The combination of the license grant and development services is distinct as Lotus plans to use the product of this bundled unit for
developing its regulatory applications. The Company concluded that the Lotus agreement contains one performance obligation, the bundle
of the license grant and development services. 

ASC 606 indicates that constrained variable consideration
should be included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative
revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Variable
considerations consisting of milestone payments and sales-based royalties may be received based on the completion of certain clinical,
regulatory, and commercial activities. The Company has concluded that the future milestone payments should be excluded from the transaction
price due to the uncertainty of achievement as of September 30, 2024. The Company will reassess this conclusion at each reporting date
until the uncertainties are resolved.

amount of the upfront payment. ASC 606 generally requires an entity to allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices (i.e., on a relative standalone selling price basis).
The Company identified the bundle of the license grant and development services as the single performance obligation in the agreement.
The initial transaction price will therefore be entirely allocated to this obligation. 

The Company has concluded that the license of
the oxylanthanum carbonate IP is functional IP. However, since it is not distinct, revenue must be recognized based on the combination
of the functional IP and the related development services. Lotus will not simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of the oxylanthanum
carbonate IP or development services. Since the performance of the development services creates an asset that will also be used by the
Company and can be licensed to other customers outside of the Territory, the Company is considered to control the asset as it is created,
and it does create an asset with an alternative use. Therefore, the Company concluded that control is not deemed to be transferred over
time and is instead transferred at a point in time. The intellectual property was transferred to Lotus in February 2023, and the development
services were determined to be immaterial to the contract. The Company has recognized a total of in the accompanying statements
of operations as licensing revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Indemnification 

In the normal course of business, the Company
enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications,
including for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual
property infringement claim by any third party with respect to its technology. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally
perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The Company s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves
claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but that have not yet been made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims
or been required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations. 

The Company believes that the likelihood of conditions
arising that would trigger these indemnities is remote and, historically, the Company had not made any significant payment under such
indemnification provisions. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any liabilities relating to these agreements. However, the Company
may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations. 

Additionally, the Company has agreed to indemnify
its directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was serving, at the Company s
request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director s or officer s
service. 

Employee Benefit Plan 

In December 2021, the Company implemented a 401(k)
Plan which covers all eligible employees of the Company (the 401(k) Plan ). Employer matching contributions are immediately
 vested. The Company s 401(k) Plan provides that the Company match each participant s contribution at up to of
the employee s eligible compensation. Company contributions to the 401(k) Plan totaled approximately and for
the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

of the Series A Convertible Voting Preferred Stock (the Series A Certificate of Designation ), the Company issued a total
of shares of common stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock in settlement of the auto-conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred
Stock.

Each holder of shares of common stock shall be
entitled to one vote for each share thereof held. 

shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock for an aggregate net proceeds of million (the Preferred
Stock Offering ), net of placement agent fees and offering expenses of million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds
from the Preferred Stock Offering to support the Company s New Drug Application (NDA) submission for approval of oxylanthanum carbonate
for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia and, if approved, for the commercial launch of oxylanthanum carbonate in the U.S. 

Pursuant to the Series A Certificate of Designation,
as of March 3, 2023, each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock was, subject to approval of the Company s stockholders, convertible
into a unit Unit consisting of: (i) shares of common stock of the Company and, if applicable, shares of Series A-2 Preferred
Stock, in lieu of common stock, (ii) a tranche A warrant to acquire approximately shares (excluding deemed dividends) of Series

A-1 Preferred Stock, shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, shares of Series A-3 Preferred Stock, shares
of Series A-4 Preferred Stock, and shares of Series A-5 Preferred Stock, together the Series A Preferred Stock .
The Series A Preferred Stock has a par value of per share. The Series A Certificate of Designation states that, to the extent that
the conversion of the Series A-1 preferred stock as well as the exercise of the Warrants into Series A-2, Series A-3, Series A-4, and
Series A-5 preferred stock results in a beneficial ownership interest in excess of the maximum percentage of common stock upon conversion,
the holders will receive the as converted equivalent for the remaining shares in preferred stock. 

The Company determined that the Warrants are freestanding
from the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, because the stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock, and the holders will be
able to sell those shares while retaining the Warrants. The Company noted that at contract inception, the Warrants were contingently issuable
upon the occurrence of a specified event (shareholder approval). 

In connection with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock
issuance, the Company recognized liabilities for the associated Warrants, which had an aggregate fair value of million at the time
of issuance. Offering costs of million were allocated to the Warrants and expensed during March 2023. The fair value of the Warrants
was accounted for as a reduction to the net proceeds of the Preferred Stock Offering, which resulted in an initial carrying value of 
million for the Series A-1 Preferred Stock (net of million of placement agent fees and offering costs allocated to the Series A-1
Preferred Stock). Refer to Note 12 for disclosures related to the Warrants. 

On June 26, 2023, the Company held its annual

Stock issued and outstanding.

Voting: Holders of the Series A-2, A-3, A-4, and
A-5 Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together with the common stock on an as-if-converted-to-common-stock basis as determined by dividing

At the option of the holder thereof, each share
of Series A-2 Preferred Stock, Series A-3 Preferred Stock, Series A-4 Preferred Stock, or Series A-5 Preferred Stock shall be convertible

shares of Series A-3 Preferred Stock, (ii) a Tranche B Warrant to acquire 
shares of Series A-4 Preferred Stock, and (iii) a Tranche C Warrant to acquire shares of Series A-5 Preferred Stock. See Note
10 for discussion of exchange agreement related to Series A-2 Preferred Stock and warrants. 

The Warrants are recognized as liabilities in
the balance sheets and were initially recognized at fair value at the time of issuance. The Warrants are also subject to remeasurement
at each balance sheet date after issuance. Any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other income (expense) in the statements
of operations in the period of change. 

The valuation of the Warrants contains unobservable
inputs that reflect the Company s own assumptions for which there is little market data. Accordingly, the Warrants are measured
at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs and are classified as Level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs
used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Warrants include, but are not limited to, probability of obtaining certain shareholder
approvals, probability of reaching certain technical milestones related to the development of oxylanthanum carbonate, and the estimated
term of the Warrants. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower)
fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the probability of obtaining certain shareholder approvals is not
correlated to a change in the probability of reaching certain technical milestones. However, a change to the assumption used for the probability
of obtaining certain shareholder approvals or a change in the probability of reaching certain technical milestones would have been accompanied
by a directionally opposite change and a directionally similar change, respectively, in the assumption used for the estimated term.

Fair Value of Stock Options 

The assumptions are based on the following for
each of the periods presented: 

Expected Term - The expected
term is calculated using the simplified method which is used when there is insufficient historical data about exercise patterns and post-vesting
employment termination behavior. The simplified method is based on the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant, or for
each vesting-tranche for awards with graded vesting. The mid-point between the vesting date and the maximum contractual expiration
date is used as the expected term under this method. 

Common Stock Fair Value - The
fair value of the common stock underlying the Company s stock options prior to the initial public offering was estimated at each
grant date and was determined on a periodic basis and based either on transactions with third parties in which common stock was sold
for cash or with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation expert. Subsequent to our initial public offering, the fair value
underlying the Company s common stock is determined based on the public market closing price on each date of grant. The assumptions
underlying these valuations represented management s best estimates, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application
of significant levels of management judgment.

Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 

Overview 

We are a biotechnology company dedicated to developing
treatments for kidney disease that have the potential to offer clinical benefit. Our development programs are focused on the development
of two novel therapies: oxylanthanum carbonate , for treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, and UNI 494,
for treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI). 

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the gradual loss
of kidney function that can get worse over time leading to lasting damage. Our initial focus is developing drugs and getting them approved
in the U.S., and then to partner with the other global biopharmaceutical companies in the rest of the world. According to United States
Renal Data System (USRDS) 2022 Annual Data Report, 30 million (14 of adults in the United States are estimated to have CKD and, of these,
approximately 13 million patients have advanced CKD (stage 3-5). Approximately 550,000 patients (ESRD) are on dialysis and of those, approximately
450,000 patients (~80 take phosphate binders to control hyperphosphatemia (too much phosphorus in their blood). The number of patients
with ESRD in the U.S. is increasing steadily and is projected to reach between 971,000 and 1,259,000 patients in 2030. 

AKI is a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney
damage (within the first 90 days of injury). After 90 days, the patient is considered to have progressed into CKD. AKI affects more than
2 million US patients and costs the healthcare system in excess of 9 billion per year. More than 300,000 patients per year in the U.S.
die due to AKI that has many causes. 

29 

Our business model is to license technologies
and drugs and pursue development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of those products in global markets. Many biotechnology companies
utilize similar strategies of in-licensing and then developing and commercializing drugs. We believe, however, that our management team s
broad network, expertise in the biopharmaceutical industry, and successful track record gives us an advantage in identifying and bringing
these assets into the Company at an attractive price with limited upfront cost. 

Since our formation we have devoted substantially
all of our resources to developing our product candidates. We have incurred significant operating losses to date. Our net losses were
 22.7 million and 15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September
30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 79.7 million. We expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we advance
our product candidates through pre-clinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval, and prepare for and, if approved, proceed
to commercialization; acquire, discover, validate and develop additional product candidates; obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our
intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel. 

We have funded our operations primarily from the
sale and issuance of common and preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and from a loan, including cash and deferred salary from
our Chief Executive Officer and principal stockholder. 

Our ability to generate product revenue will depend
on the successful development, regulatory approval and eventual commercialization of our current product candidates and future product
candidates. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through
private or public equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing.
Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into agreements to raise
capital as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of our
current product candidates and future product candidates. 

We plan to continue to use third-party service
providers, including contract manufacturing organizations, to carry out our pre-clinical and clinical development and to manufacture and
supply the materials to be used during the development and commercialization of our product candidates. 

Recent Developments 

New Drug Application 

On September 3, 2024, we submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Oxylanthanum Carbonate
(OLC) for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis. On November 11, 2024, we announced
that the FDA has accepted the NDA for OLC and has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of June 28, 2025. 

Series B Preferred Financing 

On March 13, 2024, we signed a securities purchase
agreement with certain healthcare-focused institutional investors that provided 50 million in gross proceeds to us through a private
placement. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, we issued to institutional investors 50.0 million in shares of our Series B-1
Convertible Preferred Stock. 50,000 Shares of Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock were issued at a price of 1,000.00 per share and each share is convertible into shares of common stock at a rate equal to the initial 1,000 purchase price divided by the initial
conversion price of 1.00 per share. 

On June 20, 2024, we held our annual stockholder meeting, and as a result, stockholder approval for the conversion of the Series B-1 Convertible
Preferred Stock was obtained. On July 5, 2024, pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company issued 42,118,000 shares of common stock and 7,882 shares of Series B-2 preferred stock
in settlement of the automatic conversion of the Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock 

Components of Results of Operations 

Revenues 

We recognize revenue from product sales or services
rendered when control of the promised goods is transferred to a counterparty in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we
expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: identify
the contract with the client, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction
price to performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenues when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. We may earn licensing
revenue in the future if we negotiate business development arrangements with third parties.

Research and Development Expenses 

Substantially all of our research and development
expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates. These expenses include fees paid to
third parties to conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf, consulting costs, costs for laboratory supplies, product
acquisition and license costs, certain payroll and personnel-related expenses, including salaries and bonuses, employee benefit costs
and stock-based compensation expenses for our research and product development employees and allocated overheads, including information
technology costs and utilities and expenses for the issuance of shares pursuant to the anti-dilution clause in the purchase of in process
research and development technology. We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. 

We do not allocate our costs by product candidate,
as a significant amount of research and development expenses include internal costs, such as payroll and other personnel expenses, laboratory
supplies and allocated overhead, and external costs, such as fees paid to third parties to conduct research and development activities
on our behalf, are not tracked by product candidate. 

We expect our research and development expenses
to increase substantially for at least the next few years, as we seek to initiate additional clinical trials for our product candidates,
complete our clinical programs, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and prepare for the possible commercialization of
such product candidates. Predicting the timing or cost to complete our clinical programs or validation of our commercial manufacturing
and supply processes is difficult and delays may occur because of many factors, including factors outside of our control. For example,
if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, we
could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Furthermore,
we are unable to predict when or if our product candidates will receive regulatory approval with any certainty. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses consist principally
of payroll and personnel expenses, including salaries and bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses, professional fees for
legal, consulting, accounting and tax services, including information technology costs and utilities, and other general operating expenses
not otherwise classified as research and development expenses. 

We anticipate that our general and administrative
expenses will increase as a result of increased personnel costs, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and accounting services
costs associated with complying with the applicable stock exchange and the SEC requirements, investor relations costs and director and
officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company. 

Other Expenses 

Other expenses consist of the change in fair value
of our warrant liability, interest income and interest expense.

Licensing Revenues 

Licensing revenues decreased approximately 0.7
million, or 100 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an upfront payment of approximately 0.7 million associated with
a licensing agreement entered into with Lotus International Pte Ltd. in February 2023. There was no comparable revenue earned in the current
period. We may earn additional licensing revenue in the future if we negotiate business development arrangements with third parties. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses increased by
approximately 6.0 million, or 70 , from approximately 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 14.7
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a 5.4 million
increase in drug development costs. Labor costs increased 272,000 from the prior period. Consulting and other costs increased 206,000.
Non-cash stock compensation increased 170,000. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses increased
by 1.7 million, or 26 , from approximately 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 8.1 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase of 380,000 in noncash stock compensation expense. Labor costs increased 355,000.
Insurance, travel and other costs increased 928,000 from the prior period. 

Other Income (Expenses) 

Other income (expenses) increased by 15.5 million
(income), or 178 , from 8.7 million expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.8 million income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 due primarily to the change in fair value of our warrant liability. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity 

Since our formation through December 31,
2020, we have funded our operations with the sale of common and preferred stock, convertible notes and from a loan from our Chief Executive
Officer and principal stockholder. 

As a result of our initial public offering IPO ),
on July 13, 2021 we began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol UNCY , and on July 15, 2021 we received approximately
 22.3 million in net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. We have used the net proceeds
from the IPO to complete pre-clinical and clinical studies, submit regulatory filings to the FDA, and for general and corporate purposes,
including hiring additional management and conducting market research and other commercial planning. 

Future revenue streams may consist of collaboration
or licensing revenue as well as product sales. 

On March 3, 2023, we entered into a securities
purchase agreement with certain healthcare-focused institutional investors that may provide up to 130.0 million in gross proceeds through
a private placement and that included initial upfront funding of 30.0 million. Proceeds from the offering will be used to support our
NDA submission with the FDA for approval of oxylanthanum carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in the U.S. and, if approved,
for the commercial launch of oxylanthanum carbonate in the U.S. 

On March 13, 2024, we entered into a securities
purchase agreement with certain accredited investors pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, in a private placement, 50,000 shares
of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 per share at a purchase price of 1,000 per share with an initial conversion
price of 1.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of 50.0 million. 

33 

Future Funding Requirements 

We have incurred net losses since our inception.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 15.2 million, and we expect to incur substantial additional losses
in future periods. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 79.7 million. 

We expect to continue incurring losses in the
future and will be required to raise additional capital in the future to complete our clinical trials, pursue product development initiatives
and penetrate markets for the sale of our products. We believe that we will continue to have access to capital resources through possible
equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional
financing on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to
curtail any clinical trials and development of new or existing products and take additional measures to reduce expenses in order to conserve
our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. Based on our current level of expenditures, we believe
that we have sufficient resources such that there is not substantial doubt about our ability to continue operations for at least one year
after the date that these financial statements are available to be issued. 

We anticipate that we will need to raise substantial
additional capital, the requirements for which will depend on many factors, including: 

the scope, timing, rate of progress and costs of our drug discovery efforts, pre-clinical development activities, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our current product candidates and future product candidates; 

the number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

the cost, timing and outcome of preparing for and undergoing regulatory review of our current product candidates and future product candidates; 

the scope and costs of development and commercial manufacturing activities; 

the cost and timing associated with commercializing our current product candidates and future product candidates, if they receive marketing approval; 

the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of our current product candidates and future product candidates and, ultimately, the sale of our products, following FDA approval; 

the impact, if any, of the coronavirus pandemic on our business operations; 

our ability to access capital; 

our implementation of operational, financial and management systems; and 

the costs associated with being a public company. 

34 

A change in the outcome of any of these or other
variables with respect to the development of any of our current product candidates or future product candidates could significantly change
the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future,
and we will continue to require additional capital to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.
If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which
we enter may impose upon us additional covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or
additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset
sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. 

Adequate funding may not be available to us on
acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and
our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce,
or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials or we may also be required to sell or license to others rights
to our product candidates in certain territories or indications that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. If we are
required to enter into collaborations and other arrangements to supplement our funds, we may have to give up certain rights that limit
our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or may have other terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders,
which could materially affect our business and financial condition. 

R elated Party Payable 

The Company received advances from the stockholder
of 210,000 during February 2023. The Company repaid amounts owed to the stockholder of 210,000 plus accrued interest during March 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates 

Our financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are
based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We consider our critical accounting
policies and estimates to be related to revenue, research and development, stock-based compensation, debt and equity classification and
warrant liabilities. There have been no other material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 from those used for the year ended December 31, 2023. The below policies represent our critical accounting policies. 

Revenue Recognition 

We implemented ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. This included the development of new policies based on the five-step model provided in the new revenue standard, ongoing
contract review requirements, and gathering of information provided for disclosures. We recognize revenue from product sales or services
rendered when control of the promised goods are transferred to a counterparty in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we
expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: identify
the contract with the client, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction
price to performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenues when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. 

Debt and Equity Classification 

In conjunction with the issuance of Series A-1
Preferred Stock in March 2023, and in conjunction with the issuance of Series B-1 Preferred Stock in March 2024, we initially account
for the preferred stock as temporary, or mezzanine, equity. The Series A-1 and Series B-1 Preferred Stock do not fall within the scope
of ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , do not contain any embedded derivatives that require bifurcation, and are not
classified as liabilities. However, as the Series A-1 and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, at issuance, are contingently redeemable upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control, they are required to be initially classified as mezzanine equity and measured
at the amount of net proceeds received. As the Series A-1 and Series B-1 Preferred Stock are not currently redeemable or probable of becoming
redeemable, no subsequent remeasurement is required. 

Warrant Liabilities 

In conjunction with the issuance of Series A-1
Preferred Stock (see Note 10), we established a warrant liability as of March 3, 2023, representing the fair value of warrants that may
be issued, subject to shareholder approval, upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock. We account for these warrants as liabilities
(in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity on the balance sheets as a result of certain redemption clauses
that are not within the control of the Company. The warrant liabilities are initially measured at fair value, resulting in an implied
discount on the related preferred stock financing arrangement (recognized as a partial offset to the carrying value of the Series A-1
Preferred Stock), and are remeasured at fair value each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of the warrant liabilities are recognized
in earnings during each period. The warrant liabilities are measured using Level 3 fair value inputs. See Note 12 for a description of
warrant liabilities and the related valuations. 

36 

Research and Development 

We expense costs when incurred related to the
research and development associated with the design, development and testing of product candidates, as well as acquisition of product
candidates or compounds. Research and development expenses include fees paid to third parties to conduct certain research and development
activities on our behalf, consulting costs, costs for laboratory supplies, product acquisition and license costs, certain payroll and
personnel-related expenses, including salaries and bonuses, employee benefit costs and stock-based compensation expenses for our research
and product development employees and allocated overheads, including information technology costs and utilities and expenses for issuance
of shares pursuant to anti-dilution clause in the purchase of IPR D technology. We expense both internal and external research and
development expenses as they are incurred. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We account for stock-based compensation for all
share-based payments made to employees and non-employees by estimating the fair value on the date of grant and recognizing compensation
expense over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. We recognize forfeitures related to stock-based compensation as they
occur. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires the
input of subjective assumptions, including expected common stock volatility, expected dividend yield, expected term, and the risk-free
interest rate. 

JOBS Act Accounting Election 

On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted.
Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period
provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We have chosen to take advantage of the extended
transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards until
those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not
be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

Subject to certain conditions set forth in the
JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation,
(i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with the requirement adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor s report on financial statements. We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235
billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public
offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv)
the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See the section titled Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly
report for additional information. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have during the periods presented,
and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules. 

37 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information has been accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

In evaluating the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer determined, based upon the existence of the material weakness described below, that we did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. Specifically, we lack a sufficient number of professionals with an appropriate
level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately
while maintaining appropriate segregation of duties. Without such professionals, we did not design and maintain formal accounting policies,
procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including controls over
the preparation and review of account reconciliations and journal entries. 

The lack of adequate staffing levels and expertise
of unusual or infrequent transactions with complex or infrequently applied accounting topics resulted in the insufficient level of supervision,
review and approval of certain information used to prepare our financial statements and the maintenance of effective controls to adequately
monitor and review significant transactions for financial statement completeness and accuracy. These control deficiencies, although varying
in severity, contributed to the material weakness in the control environment. If one or more material weaknesses persist or if we fail
to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately report our financial results
could be adversely affected. 

The above material weakness did not result in
a material misstatement of our previously issued financial statements, however, it could result in a misstatement of our account balances
or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented
or detected. 

Management is taking steps to remediate the material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. To address the issues, we plan to hire additional personnel. Specifically,
management has: 

Increased the number of accounting personnel; 

Engaged third party experts to assist management in analyses and conclusions involving complex or infrequently applied accounting treatment; and 

Engaged third party experts to assist management in completing a comprehensive risk assessment to identify, design and implement control activities. 

In addition, management is taking steps to review
and enhance business policies, procedures and related internal controls to standardize business processes. 

We expect to complete the remediation by the end
of 2024. We expect to incur additional costs to remediate this weakness. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting. 

38 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We are not currently a party to any material legal
proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. We may periodically be the subject of various pending or
threatened legal actions and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings
or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors, and there
can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made in our financial
statements at September 30, 2024 with respect to such matters. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

There have been no material changes from the risk
factors disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the following: 

If we fail to comply
with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock
and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. 

Our Common Stock is currently
listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the continued listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market is contingent on our continued
compliance with a number of listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital
Market, our Common Stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which would limit investors ability to effect transactions
in our Common Stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions. In order to maintain our listing, we must maintain certain share
prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders equity and a minimum number
of public stockholders, as well as satisfy other listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition to these objective standards,
Nasdaq Capital Market may delist the securities of any issuer for other reasons involving the judgment of Nasdaq Capital Market. 

On July 9, 2024, we received
written notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of our common stock had been below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. In
accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810, we have a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 6, 2025, to regain compliance with
the minimum bid price requirement and market value of common stock requirement. To regain compliance with the Nasdaq bid price requirement,
the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive business days during this 180
calendar day period. In the event we do not regain compliance by January 6, 2025, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day
grace period; however, there can be no assurance that we will regain compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. 

There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain
compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing standards and/or continue our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market in the
future. 

If the Nasdaq Capital Market delists our Common
Stock from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect the Common
Stock would qualify to be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences,
including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity for our securities; 

substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds; 

the loss of institutional investor interest and a decreased
ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; 

a determination that our Common Stock is a penny stock, 
which will require brokers trading in our Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading
activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

potential breaches of representations or covenants of our
agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements, which,
regardless of merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time and attention
and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.

Certificate of Correction 

On November 8, 2024, we filed a Certificate of
Correction with the Secretary of State of Delaware Certificate of Correction for our Certificate of Designation of Preferences,
Rights and Limitations of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Series B Certificate of Designation filed with the Secretary
of State of Delaware on March 14, 2024. The Certificate of Correction was filed to correct certain scrivener s errors in the Series
B Certificate of Designation with respect to voting rights for the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock under Section 4(a) and conversion
at the option of holder under Section 6(c) thereof. Specifically, Section 4(a) of the Series B Certificate of Designation inadvertently
stated that the Voting Conversion Price be used for determining the as-converted amount of the Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock instead of using the Conversion Price for such determination and also failed to reference the limitations imposed
by Section 6(f). In addition, Section 6(c) of the Series B Certificate of Designation inadvertently used a fixed number of shares of common
stock into which shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock convert into (one thousand shares), instead of based on the conversion
rate equal to the Stated Value 1,000) divided by the Conversion Price 1.00). Pursuant to Section 103(f) of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, the correction was effective as of March 14, 2024, except as to those persons who are substantially and adversely affected by the
correction, and as to those persons the correction was effective as of November 8, 2024. 

The foregoing description of the Certificate of
Correction is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Correction, which is filed herewith as Exhibit
3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
