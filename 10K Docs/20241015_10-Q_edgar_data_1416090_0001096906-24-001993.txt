In the complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, the Company asserts claims related to alleged breach of contract and unjust enrichment against the Defendants, and seeks a monetary judgment and an award of attorneys fees and other expenses. The complaint arises from the Defendants failure to convey agreed-upon consideration to the Company as contracted for the sale of CMCS. The Company intends to pursue the lawsuit aggressively. Despite several attempts, the Company has not yet effected service of process on Mother Lode Mining, Inc. On January 18, 2023, the Company negotiated a settlement with Antilles Family Office, LLC through which the Company paid to Antilles and the remaining balance of and the accrued interest of under the original Secured Redeemable Convertible Promissory Note was forgiven. The Company s former subsidiary, Compa a Minera Clavo Rico, S.A. de C.V., has been served with a lawsuit filed by SAR, the taxing authority in Honduras, alleging additional tax liability due. The Complaint alleges that HNL7,186,151,96 lempires are due in a demand for execution of a forced extrajudicial title. The Company had accrued in this matter, but the liability was extinguished with the sale of the subsidiary. In the opinion of management, as of June 30, 2024, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such matters, if any, may be likely to have a material impact on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, as the outcome of litigation and other claims is difficult to predict significant changes in the estimated exposures could exist. On September 22, 2023, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with William McCluskey. This agreement requires the Company to pay in consulting fees to William McCluskey before March 31, 2025.

Historically operated two mining projects and currently operate as a consultant and advisor to the mining industry. Additionally, we have been engaged in the production of precious metals. From 2013 to 2020, the Company owned certain real property and the associated exploration permits and mineral rights commonly known as the UP and Burlington Gold Mine in Idaho UP and Burlington ). From 2015 through January 24, 2023, the Company operated the Clavo Rico mine in Honduras through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Compa a Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A de C.V. CMCS and other mining concessions. The Clavo Rico mine s workings include several historical underground mining operations dating back to the early Mayan and Spanish occupation, and the primary mine operated through 2022 is located on the 200-hectare Clavo Rico Concession, located in southern Honduras. 2023 Divestiture of the Clavo Rico Mine On January 12, 2023, Inception Mining, Inc. (the Company entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (the LOI with Mother Lode Mining, Inc. MLM ). The LOI became binding on January 24, 2023 when the final installment of initial payment set forth under the LOI was received by the Company. 18 Table of Contents Pursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company agreed to sell all of the shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Compa a Minera Cerros Del Sur, S.A. de C.V. CMCS ), to MLM. CMCS is the Honduran-based company that owns the Clavo Rico mine. The purchase price for the sale of CMCS by the Company to MLM consisted of the following cash consideration (a) 280,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 3, 2023 to pay outstanding debts owed by the Corporation; (b) 300,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 5, 2023 to satisfy existing debts of the Company; (c) 100,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 16, 2023; (d) 200,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 17, 2023; (e) 1,200,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 18, 2023, to pay a settlement amount for existing debt of the Company; (f) 500,000 was delivered by MLM to the Company on January 23, 2023, to satisfy existing debts of the Company; (g) 500,000 was delivered by MLM to the Corporation on January 24, 2023 to satisfy existing debts of the Corporation.

The Monthly Payments shall be paid as follows: (i) 25,000 due March 1, 2023, (ii) 50,000 due on the first day of each of April, May and June 2023, and (iii) 100,000 due on the first day of each month for the following twenty months, until February 1, 2025 at which point all amounts due and payable hereunder shall be delivered in a final balloon payment. Outstanding balances and missed Monthly Payments will be secured by a 10 NSR on the Clavo Rico mine production until the Monthly Payments are delivered and the purchase price is paid in full. In addition to the Monthly Payments, the Company will receive a carried forward net profits interest royalty NPI of 5 on the Clavo Rico mine production until the total NPI paid to the Company is 1,000,000, subject to limited conditions. Following the Closing of the LOI on January 24, 2023, the Company divested its ownership interest in CMCS and its interests in the Clavo Rico mine, resulting in the transfer of operations to Mother Lode Mining and full control of the Clavo Rico mine asset. Current Operations Since the Divestiture of the Clavo Rico Mine, the Company has been operating as a consultant and advisor to the mining industry. It also has an ongoing financial interest in the Clavo Rico Mine under the LOI. According to the LOI, the Company is entitled to receive 2,700,000 in cash payments through January 2025, with such payments secured by a ten percent net smelter royalty on the Clavo Rico Mine s production. The Company will also receive a carried forward net profits interest royalty of five percent of the Clavo Rico mine production until payment to the Company reaches 1,000,000, subject to reduction for certain limited Clavo Rico mine expenses. Results of Operations Three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 We had net loss of 505,529 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, and a net income of 242,945 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2023. This change in our results over the two periods is primarily the result of a decrease in interest expense of 274,554, the change of derivative liabilities of 31,246, the initial derivative expense of 136,466, a change in gain on extinguishment of debt of 421,289.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our balance sheet as of June 30, 2024, reflects assets of 6,022. We had cash in the amount of 2 and working capital deficit in the amount of 3,187,110 as of June 30, 2024. Thus, we do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months.

Going Concern Consideration As reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of 29,673,091. In addition, there is a working capital deficit of 3,187,110 as of June 30, 2024. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

This decrease in the cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the payments made towards the sale of mine property of 3,435,000 and the net gain from discontinued operations in 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials. Costs of acquiring mining properties and any exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred unless proven and probable reserves exist, and the property is a commercially mineable property. Mine development costs incurred either to develop new gold and silver deposits, expand the capacity of operating mines, or develop mine areas substantially in advance of current production are capitalized. Costs incurred to maintain current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations. Costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment. The Company evaluates, at least quarterly, the carrying value of capitalized mining costs and related property, plant, and equipment costs, if any, to determine if these costs are in excess of their net realizable value and if a permanent impairment needs to be recorded. The periodic evaluation of carrying value of capitalized costs and any related property, plant and equipment costs are based upon expected future cash flows and/or estimated salvage value. The Company capitalizes costs for mining properties by individual property and defers such costs for later amortization only if the prospects for economic productions are reasonably certain. Capitalized costs are expensed in the period when the determination has been made that economic production does not appear reasonably certain. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For recent accounting pronouncements, please refer to the notes to financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosures under this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the 1934 Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, because of the Company s limited resources and limited number of employees, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 22 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Except as set forth below, we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. On March 4, 2024, the Company filed a complaint against Mother Lode Mining, Inc., a Canadian company, and Robert Salna (the Defendants"), alleging an amount of not less than 2,237,800 (plus interest, additional costs and attorneys fees) due from Defendants as a result of their breach of their obligations and duties arising from the sale of Compa a Minera Cerros Del Sur, S.A. de C.V. in 2023 (the Sale ). In the complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, the Company asserts claims related to alleged breach of contract and unjust enrichment against the Defendants, and seeks a monetary judgment and an award of attorneys fees and other expenses. The complaint arises from the Defendants failure to convey agreed-upon consideration to the Company as contracted for the sale of CMCS. The Company intends to pursue the lawsuit aggressively.
