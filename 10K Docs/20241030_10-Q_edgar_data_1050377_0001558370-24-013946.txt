 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance and include statements concerning, among other things, our future financial results, business plans (including statements regarding new products and services we may offer and future expenditures, costs and investments), liabilities, impairment charges, competition, and the expected impact of current macroeconomic conditions on our businesses and results of operations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may, will, would, should, expects, plans, could, intends, target, projects, believes, estimates, anticipates, potential or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. These statements reflect our current views and are based on assumptions as of the date of this report. Such assumptions are based upon internal estimates and other analyses of current market conditions and trends, management expectations, plans, and strategies, economic conditions, and other factors. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations or results projected or implied by forward-looking statements. Such differences may result from actions taken by us, including expense reduction or strategic initiatives (including reductions in force, capital investments and new or expanded product offerings or services), the execution of our business plans (including our inventory management, cost structure and management and other personnel decisions) or other business decisions, as well as from developments beyond our control, including: substantial competition reducing our market share; significant price competition reducing our profit margins; the loss of any of our major vendors adversely affecting the number of type of products we may offer; virtualization of information technology, or IT, resources and applications, including networks, servers, applications, and data storage disrupting or altering our traditional distribution models; service interruptions at third-party shippers negatively impacting our ability to deliver the products we offer to our customers; increases in shipping and postage costs reducing our margins and adversely affecting our results of operations; loss of key persons or the inability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel adversely affecting our ability to operate our business; cyberattacks or the failure to safeguard personal information and our IT systems resulting in liability and harm to our reputation; and macroeconomic factors facing the global economy, including disruptions in the capital markets, economic sanctions and economic slowdowns or recessions, rising inflation and changing interest rates reducing the level of investment our customers are willing to make in IT products. 
 Additional factors include those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including under the captions Risk Factors, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Business, in our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including under the caption Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in the other subsequent filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances. You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statements are made except as required by law. Unless the context otherwise requires, we use the terms Connection , the Company , we , us , and our in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to refer to PC Connection, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

 OVERVIEW We are a Fortune 1000 Global Solutions Provider that simplifies the IT customer experience, guiding the connection between people and technology. Our dedicated account managers partner with customers to design, deploy, and support cutting-edge IT environments using the latest hardware, software, and services. We provide a wide range of IT solutions, from the desktop to the cloud including computer systems, data center solutions, software and peripheral equipment, networking communications, and other products and accessories that we purchase from manufacturers, distributors, and other suppliers. Our Technology Solutions Organization, or TSO, and state-of-the-art Technology Integration and Distribution Center with ISO 9001:2015 certified technical configuration lab offer end-to-end services related to the design, configuration, and implementation of IT solutions. Our team also provides a comprehensive portfolio of managed services and professional services. These services are performed by our personnel and by third-party providers. Our GlobalServe offering ensures worldwide coverage for our multinational customers, delivering global procurement solutions through our network of in-country suppliers in over 150 countries. The Connection brand includes Connection Enterprise Solutions, Connection Business Solutions, and Connection Public Sector Solutions, which provide IT solutions and services to enterprise, small- to medium-sized businesses, and public sector markets. Financial results for each of our segments are included in the financial statements attached hereto. We generate sales through (i) outbound inside sales and field sales contacts by sales representatives focused on the business, educational, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and government markets, (ii) our websites, and (iii) direct responses from customers responding to our advertising media. We offer a broad selection of over 460,000 products at competitive prices, including products from vendors like Apple, Cisco, Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft Corporation, and VMware, and we partner with more than 2,500 suppliers. We are able to leverage our state-of-the art logistic capabilities to rapidly ship product to customers. As a value-added reseller in the IT supply chain, we do not manufacture IT hardware or software products. We are dependent on our suppliers manufacturers and distributors that historically have only sold to resellers rather than directly to end users. However, certain manufacturers have, on multiple occasions, sold or attempted to sell directly to our customers, and in some cases, have restricted our ability to sell their products directly to certain customers, thereby attempting to and, in some cases successfully, eliminate our role. We believe that the success of these direct sales efforts by manufacturers will depend on their ability to meet our customers ongoing demands and provide solutions to meet their needs. We believe more of our customers are seeking out comprehensive and integrated IT solutions, rather than the ability to acquire specific IT products on a one-off basis. Our advantage is our ability to be product-neutral and provide a broader combination of products, services, and advice tailored to our customers individual needs. By providing customers with customized solutions from a variety of manufacturers, we believe we can mitigate the negative impact of continued direct sales initiatives from individual manufacturers. Through the formation of our TSO, we are able to provide customers complete IT solutions, from identifying their needs, to designing, developing, and managing the integration of products and services to implement their IT projects. Such service offerings carry higher margins than traditional product sales. Additionally, the technical certifications of our service engineers permit us to offer higher-end, more complex products that generally carry higher gross margins. We expect these service offerings and technical certifications to continue to play a role in sales generation and gross margin improvements in this competitive environment. The primary challenges we continue to face in effectively managing our business are (1) increasing our product and service revenues while at the same time improving our gross margin in all three segments, (2) recruiting, retaining, and improving the productivity of our sales and technical support personnel, and (3) effectively controlling our selling, general and administrative, or SG A, expenses while making major investments in our IT systems and solution selling personnel, especially in relation to changing revenue levels. To support future growth, we have invested and expect to continue to invest in our IT solutions business, which requires the addition of highly skilled service engineers. Although we expect to realize the ultimate benefit of higher-margin service revenues under this multi-year initiative, we believe that our cost of services will increase as we add additional service engineers. If our service revenues do not grow enough to offset the cost of these headcount additions, our operating results may be negatively impacted.

 Market conditions and technology advances significantly affect the demand for our products and services. Virtual delivery of software products and advanced Internet technology providing customers enhanced functionality have substantially increased customer expectations, requiring us to invest on an ongoing basis in our own IT infrastructure to meet these new demands. Our investments in IT infrastructure are designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and provide our customers enhanced functionality. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth information derived from our statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated (dollars in millions): 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net sales 724.7 693.1 2,093.2 2,154.2 Gross margin 18.7 19.0 18.6 17.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 14.5 14.4 15.1 14.1 Income from operations 4.1 4.6 3.6 3.5 Net sales of 724.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 reflected an increase of 31.6 million, or 4.6 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases in net sales of notebooks/mobility, desktops, software, accessories, and displays and sound of 37.9 million, 10.8 million, 8.7 million, 8.5 million, and 4.1 million, respectively, as shown in the table in Note 2 Revenue in the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of advanced technology categories including net/com products, servers/storage, and other hardware/services of 26.3 million, 6.7 million, and 5.6 million, respectively. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 increased year-over-year by 3.5 million, or 2.7 , to 135.4 million as illustrated in the table and the discussion beginning on page 19 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Gross margin decreased to 18.7 from 19.0 a year ago. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a shift in product mix to lower-margin sales of endpoint devices including notebooks/mobility and desktops as shown in the table in Note 2 Revenue in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the product mix table on page 18. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the amount of software sales recognized on a net basis. SG A expenses increased year-over-year by 5.6 million, or 5.6 , to 105.4 million. SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 14.5 compared to 14.4 a year ago. The increase in SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to increases in personnel costs related to investments in resources designed to strengthen our sales, technical sales, and services capabilities, advertising, and service contracts/subscriptions as shown in the table on page 18 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q combined with the increase in net sales as discussed above. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased year-over-year both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales by 2.0 million and 50 basis points, respectively, primarily as a result of the increase in SG A expenses as discussed above.

Sales to the federal government increased by 25.6 million, or 97.2 , compared to the prior year quarter, and sales to state and local government and educational institutions increased by 2.0 million, or 1.7 . The increase in sales to the federal government was primarily driven by a few large orders in the current period. The increase in net sales is primarily due to increases in net sales of notebooks/mobility, software, and accessories of 30.4 million, 8.4 million, and 4.4 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of net/com products, displays and sound, servers/storage, and desktops of 7.6 million, 4.4 million, 2.6 million, and 1.1 million, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated funds from operations, short-term investments, and borrowings under our credit facility. We have historically used and expect to use in the future those funds to meet our capital requirements, which consist primarily of working capital for operational needs, capital expenditures for computer equipment and software used in our business, repurchases of our common stock for treasury, dividend payments, and as opportunities arise, possible acquisitions of new businesses.

Table of Contents 
 We believe that funds generated from operations, short-term investments, and the available capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, and other requirements for at least the next twelve calendar months and beyond such twelve calendar month period. Our investments in IT systems and infrastructure are designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and to provide our customers enhanced functionality. We expect to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond through a combination of cash on hand, short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and borrowings under our credit facility, as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents . As of September 30, 2024, we had 167.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Short-term Investments . As of September 30, 2024, we had 261.6 million in short-term investments. Cash Generated from Operations . We expect to generate cash flows from operations in excess of operating cash needs by generating earnings and managing net changes in inventories and receivables with changes in payables to generate positive cash flow. Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding under our 50.0 million credit facility, which is available until March 31, 2025. Accordingly, our entire line of credit was available for borrowing as of September 30, 2024. This maximum borrowing capacity under our credit facility can be increased, at our option, to up to 80.0 million for approved acquisitions or other uses authorized by the bank. Borrowings are, however, limited by certain minimum collateral and earnings requirements, as described more fully below. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants of our credit facility. Our ability to continue funding our planned growth, both internally and externally, is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing, or from other sources of financing, as may be required. While we do not anticipate needing any additional sources of financing to fund our operations at this time, if demand for IT products declines, or our customers are materially adversely impacted by the developing macroeconomic trends characterized by inflation and increased interest rates, our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected. Dividends A summary of 2024 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows: 

Dividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date 0.10 February 12, 2024 February 27, 2024 March 15, 2024 0.10 April 30, 2024 May 14, 2024 May 29, 2024 0.10 July 30, 2024 August 13, 2024 August 30, 2024 On October 30, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of 0.10 per share. The dividend will be paid on November 29, 2024 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 12, 2024. The declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial position, strategic plans, general business conditions and any other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Summary of Sources and Uses of Cash Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as reflected in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, are summarized in the following table (in millions): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 148.7 185.7 Net cash used in investing activities (109.7) (56.1) Net cash used in financing activities (16.4) (12.0) Increase in cash and cash equivalents 22.6 117.6

Table of Contents 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 148.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from 66.4 million of net income, an increase in accounts payable of 29.1 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of 20.9 million. A decrease in inventory of 10.5 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 9.6 million, and depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense added back to net income of 9.8 million and 6.2 million, respectively, also contributed to the positive inflow of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These inflows were partially offset by the amortization of discounts on short-term investments of 4.4 million subtracted from net income. The increase in accounts payable and decrease in accounts receivable were primarily driven by the timing of payments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash charges of 76.8 million, a decrease in inventory of 66.4 million, an increase in accounts payable of 31.6 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of 20.9 million, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses, income tax receivable, and other current assets of 9.6 million. In order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs, we monitor our cash conversion cycle, defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average. Components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows: 

September 30, (in days) 2024 2023 Days of sales outstanding (DSO) (1) 67 71 Days of supply in inventory (DIO) (2) 18 23 Days of purchases outstanding (DPO) (3) (45) (43) Cash conversion cycle 40 51 (1) Represents the trade receivable at the end of the quarter divided by average daily net sales for the same three-month period. (2) Represents the inventory balance at the end of the quarter divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period. (3) Represents the accounts payable balance at the end of the quarter divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period. The cash conversion cycle decreased to 40 days at September 30, 2024, compared to 51 days at September 30, 2023. The decrease in DSO is consistent with the increase in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in DIO is consistent with the decrease in inventory for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in DPO is consistent with the increase in accounts payable as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 255.1 million of purchases of U.S. Government treasury securities, 150.6 million of maturities of U.S. Government treasury securities, and 5.2 million of purchases of property and equipment. These property and equipment expenditures were primarily for computer equipment and capitalized internally developed software in connection with investments in our IT infrastructure. In the prior year period, investing activities consisted of 48.7 million of purchases of U.S. Government treasury securities and 7.4 million of purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 25.2 million of aggregate borrowings and repayments, 7.7 million of treasury purchases, 7.9 million of dividend payments, 0.5 million of issuances of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 1.3 million payments of payroll taxes on stock-based compensation through shares withheld. In the prior year period, financing activities primarily consisted of 70.9 million of aggregate borrowings and repayments, 5.4 million of treasury purchases, 6.3 million of dividend payments, 0.5 million of issuances of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 0.9 million payments of payroll taxes on stock-based compensation through shares withheld.

For more information about our obligations, commitments, and contingencies, see our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . Credit Facility. Our credit facility extends until March 2025 and is collateralized by our accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2024, our borrowing capacity under the credit facility was up to 50.0 million. Amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at the greatest of (i) the prime rate (8.00 at September 30, 2024), (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50 per annum, and (iii) the daily BSBY Rate, plus 1.00 per annum, provided that the rate shall at no time be less than 0 per annum. In addition, we have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity under the credit facility up to an additional 30.0 million provided that we meet certain additional borrowing requirements and obtain the consent of the administrative agent. Our credit facility is subject to certain covenant requirements which are described below under Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity . We did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of September 30, 2024. Cash receipts are automatically applied against any outstanding borrowings. Any excess cash on account may either remain on account to generate earned credits to offset up to 100 of cash management fees, or may be invested in short-term qualified investments. Borrowings under the credit facility are classified as current in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the entire 50.0 million facility was available for borrowing. Operating Leases. We lease facilities from a related party, which is a company affiliated with us through common ownership, and facilities from third parties under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance charges. See Item 2. Properties in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding our operating leases. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting our internally generated funds are our ability to manage costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies, timely collection of our customer receivables, and management of our inventory levels. Credit Facility. Our credit facility extends until March 2025 and is collateralized by our accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2024, the entire 50.0 million facility was available for borrowing. Our credit facility contains certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions (including restrictions on additional debt, guarantees, and other distributions, investments, and liens) with which we and all of our subsidiaries must comply. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default and could prevent us from borrowing additional funds under this line of credit. This credit facility contains two financial tests: The funded debt ratio (defined as the average outstanding advances under the line for the quarter, divided by the consolidated trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA) must not be more than 2.0 to 1.0. Such amount was calculated as 0.0 to 1.0 at September 30, 2024, and accordingly, the funded debt ratio did not limit potential borrowings as of September 30, 2024. Future decreases in our consolidated trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA could limit our potential borrowings under the line of credit. Minimum consolidated net worth (defined as our consolidated total assets less our consolidated total liabilities) must be at least 346.7 million, plus 50 of consolidated net income for each quarter, beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2016 (loss quarters not counted). Such amount was calculated as 636.2 million at September 30, 2024 , whereas our actual consolidated stockholders equity at that date was 897.4 million. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital market depends upon, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the IT industry, our financial performance and stock price, and the state of the capital markets. In addition, market volatility, inflation and interest rate fluctuations may increase our cost of financing or restrict our access to potential sources of future liquidity.

 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE S Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as described above. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
