 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (in thousands, except shares and per share amounts) 
 (unaudited) 

and negative working capital of . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated operating income of and , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated positive net cash flows from operations of . The Company s contingent consideration obligation is dependent upon the market value of the Company s share price at a future date, February 17, 2025, and contractually must be settled in cash. The estimated liability for financial statement accounting purposes is as of September 30, 2024. While the Company is currently generating cash from operations and has refinanced its debt, the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 7 below) limits, via specific reserve, utilization of the Company s line of credit to no more than for payments to satisfy the contingent consideration obligation. Should the contingent consideration require a cash payment at maturity in excess of the Company s availability under the Credit Agreement, inclusive of such reserve, the Company may not have sufficient liquidity to settle this obligation without receipt of a waiver under the Credit Agreement or a reduction in the amount of the contingent consideration obligation. The conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern under the technical framework within ASU 205 - 40. 
 
 In response to these conditions, the Company continues to evaluate its available options for amending its debt facilities or accessing the capital markets via equity financing. However, these plans have not been finalized, are subject to market conditions, in some respects are not within the Company s control, and therefore cannot be deemed probable. As a result, the Company has concluded that management's plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services under the terms of a contract and is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. The Company has very few contracts with material extended payment terms as payment is typically due at or shortly after the time of the sale, typically ranging between thirty and ninety days. In those instances where the Company has material extended payment terms (most commonly in multi-year arrangements where the Company acts as an agent to a transaction on behalf of its customers), the Company evaluates and applies constraints to arrive at the revenue recognized in the period in which a contract is entered. Observable prices are used to determine the standalone selling price of separate performance obligations or a cost plus margin approach when one is not available. Sales, value-added and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. 
 
 The Company recognizes contract assets or unbilled receivables related to revenue recognized for services completed but not yet invoiced to the customers. A contract liability is recognized as deferred revenue when the Company invoices customers in advance of performing the related services under the terms of a contract. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the Company has satisfied the related performance obligation. 
 
 The Company uses the practical expedient for recording an immediate expense for incremental costs of obtaining contracts, including certain design/engineering services, commissions, incentives, and payroll taxes, as these incremental and recoverable costs have terms that do not exceed one year.

shares of Creative Realities common stock (the Merger Shares ). The Merger Agreement also requires the Company to pay to the former Reflect stockholders additional contingent cash payments (the Guaranteed Consideration ), if any, payable on or after February 17, 2025 subject to the Extension Option described below, the Guarantee Date ), in an amount by which the value of the Merger Shares on the Guarantee Date is less than per share (such applicable amount, the Guaranteed Price ), multiplied by the number of Merger Shares held by the Reflect stockholders on the Guarantee Date. On March 23, 2023, after the closing of the Merger, the Company completed a 1 -for- reverse stock split (the Reverse Split primarily intended to bring the Company into compliance with the minimum bid price requirements to maintain the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result of the Reverse Split, the number of Merger Shares decreased from 2,333,334 to . The Company and RSI have engaged in discussions regarding the impact that the Reverse Split had on the calculation of the Guaranteed Consideration, given that the Merger Agreement provides for a Guaranteed Price of 6.40 per share and does not provide for any adjustment to the Guaranteed Price as a result of the Reverse Stock Split or other similar transaction with respect to the Company s common stock. To date, the Company and RSI have not reached any agreement regarding the methodology for calculating Guaranteed Consideration under the plain terms of the Merger Agreement. 
 
 The contingent liability associated with the Guaranteed Consideration is recorded in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and is remeasured at each reporting period in accordance with ASC 805 - 30 - 35 - 1 using a Monte Carlo simulation model. 
 
 For financial statement purposes, consistent with prior reporting periods since the Reverse Split, the Company has and continues to book a contingent liability as of September 30, 2024 related to the Guaranteed Consideration as though the Reverse Split increased the Guaranteed Price from 6.40 per share to per share, thereby recording an estimated potential liability for contingent consideration, at fair value of . The contingent liability, at fair value, as of September 30, 2024 related to the Guaranteed Consideration that would be calculated using a Guaranteed Price of 6.40 per share would result in an estimated liability of . The Company engaged an outside independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of the Guaranteed Consideration at both the 6.40 and 19.20 Guaranteed Prices. 
 
 While we believe that the Merger Agreement provides no adjustment to the Guaranteed Price as a result of the Reverse Split, resulting in a lower amount of Guaranteed Consideration than the contingent liability reflected in our financial statements, no assurance can be provided that our interpretation of the Merger Agreement will ultimately be accepted by RSI and the former Reflect stockholders, or by any arbitrator or court that ultimately adjudicates the matter. 
 
 The Company may exercise an extension option (the Extension Option to extend the Guarantee Date by six 6 months, from February 17, 2025 to August 17, 2025, if (i) the Extension Threshold Price is greater than or equal to of the Guaranteed Price described above, and (ii) the Company provides written notice of its election to exercise the Extension Option no later than February 7, 2025. The Extension Threshold Price means the average closing price per share of Creative Realities common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market (or NYSE) in the fifteen 15 consecutive trading day period ending February 2, 2025. The Merger Agreement provides that if the Extension Threshold Price is less than of the Guaranteed Price, then the Guaranteed Price will be increased by per share (which amount has not been adjusted as a result of the Reverse Split). 

NOTE 3: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
 
 We measure certain financial assets, including cash equivalents, at fair value on a recurring basis. In accordance with ASC 820 - 10 - 30, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 - 10 - 35 establishes a three -level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The three hierarchy levels are defined as follows: 
 
 Level 1 Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 
 
 Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs (other than Level 1 prices), such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 
 Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and involve management judgment and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participants and pricing. 
 
 The calculation of the fair value of the contingent consideration contains inputs which are unobservable and involve management judgment and are considered Level 3 estimates. Additionally, the separately identifiable intangible assets rely on a discounted cash flow model which utilizes inputs including the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital and management s forecast of future financial performance which are unobservable and involve management judgment and are considered Level 3 estimates. 
 
 The calculation of the weighted average cost of capital and management s forecast of future financial performance utilized within our discounted cash flow model for the impairment of goodwill contains inputs which are unobservable and involve management judgment and are considered Level 3 estimates.

Other Services 

Total Services 

Total Hardware and Services 

Hardware 
 
 System hardware revenue is recognized generally upon shipment of the product or customer acceptance depending upon contractual arrangements with the customer in instances in which the sale of hardware is the sole performance obligation. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in hardware sales and the related shipping costs are included in hardware cost of sales. The cost of freight and shipping to the customer is recognized in cost of sales at the time of transfer of control to the customer. 

Managed Services 
 
 Software as a service SaaS license sales 
 
 Software as a service includes revenue from software licensing and delivery in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted by the Company. These services often include software updates which provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Contracts for these services are generally - months in length. We account for revenue from these services in accordance with ASC 985 - 20 - 15 - 5 and recognize revenue ratably over the performance period. 
 
 Maintenance and support services 
 
 The Company sells support services that include access to technical support personnel for software and hardware troubleshooting. The Company offers a hosting service through our network operations center, or NOC, allowing the ability to monitor and support our customers networks 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. These contracts are generally - months in length and typically have autorenewal terms. Revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs incurred in fulfilling performance obligations under the contract. 
 
 Maintenance and support fees are based on the level of service provided to end customers, which can range from monitoring the health of a customer s network, supporting a sophisticated web-portal, or managing the end-to-end hardware and software of a digital marketing system. These agreements are renewable by the customer. Rates for maintenance and support, including subsequent renewal rates, are typically established based upon a fee per location, per device, or a specified percentage of net software license fees as set forth in the arrangement. These contracts are generally 12 - 36 months in length. Revenue is recognized ratably and evenly over the service period. 
 
 The Company also performs time and materials-based maintenance and repair work for customers. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation has been fully satisfied. 
 
 Installation Services 
 
 The Company performs installation services associated with system hardware sales to customers and recognizes revenue upon completion of the installations. Installation services also include engineering and configuration services required to be performed to design and deploy a digital signage system that subsequently becomes an installation project. 
 
 When system hardware sales include installation services to be performed by the Company, the goods and services in the contract are, in certain instances, not distinct as the customer contract contemplates an installed solution, inclusive of system hardware. In those instances, the arrangement is accounted for as a single performance obligation. Our customers may control the work-in-process and can make changes to the design specifications over the contract term. In these circumstances, revenues are recognized over time as the installation services are completed based on the relative portion of labor hours completed as a percentage of the budgeted hours for the installation. Typically, in large scale deployments that include installation services, the contract terms segregate performance obligations related to hardware sales and installation services by providing for different legal transfer of title and risk of loss. In those circumstances, installation services are deemed to be a separate performance obligation. In each instance, installation services are recognized at the time of completion. 

Other Services 
 
 Software design and development services 
 
 Software design and custom development sales represent fixed fee orders for work on a time and materials basis and are recognized as revenue when the application, feature, or custom software code has been received and delivery has occurred to the customer. Revenue is recognized generally upon customer acceptance (point-in-time) of the software product and verification that it meets the required specifications. Software is delivered to customers electronically. 
 
 Media sales 
 
 Media revenues are derived from selling (i) promotion and sponsorship packages to monetize customer infrastructure assets, including mobile takeover or physical presence, or (ii) digital advertising inventory to advertisers on digital displays or other outdoor structures, owned or controlled by our customers, each within physical venues. We sell advertising or sponsorship opportunities on behalf of our media network owner customers to brands and advertisers. We generally do not own the devices that display the sold digital advertising. The Company has concluded that it acts as an agent and reports media revenues on a net basis, with the Company recording its commission, which typically is between thirty percent and forty percent of the total media sales contract, as revenue in the consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The media sales contracts we facilitate on behalf of our customers range from a single day to eight years. The Company invoices advertisers on behalf of our customers and remits the net cash to our customer after the advertiser has paid the Company the fees owed for such advertising. Media revenue services are recognized when the Company has completed its performance obligations under the contract with our customers, which typically has concluded upon facilitating execution of contracts between our customer and a brand/advertiser. The Company applies time-based constraints in accordance with ASC 606 to evaluate the earned portion of the contract to record at execution. 
 
 For revenues generated through the use of a subcontracted advertising agency, commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage of gross advertising revenue and reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations within Sales and Marketing Expenses.

 Goodwill 
 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to an impairment review at a reporting unit level, evaluated on an annual basis at September 30th each fiscal year, when an event occurs, or circumstances change that would indicate potential impairment. The assessment may be performed quantitatively or qualitatively. The Company has only one reporting unit, and therefore the entire goodwill is allocated to that reporting unit. The Company assesses the carrying value of goodwill at the reporting unit level based on an estimate of the fair value of its reporting unit. 
 
 Using the quantitative approach, fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using both 1 a market approach, leveraging recent industry merger and acquisition activity as well as comparable public company information, and 2 a discounted cash flow analyses consisting of various assumptions, including expectations of future cash flows based on projections or forecasts derived from analysis of business prospects and economic or market trends that may occur. Specifically, the Company gives significant consideration to actual historic financial results, including revenue growth rates in the current and preceding three years, further informed by known backlog and customer acquisitions. 
 
 Using the qualitative approach, the Company reviews macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and entity specific factors, including strategies and financial performance for potential indicators of impairment. 
 
 The Company performed its annual impairment of goodwill qualitatively in 2024, and quantitatively in 2023 to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is below its carrying amount. Based on the Company s assessment, we determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and accordingly, the goodwill associated with the reporting unit was not considered to be impaired at September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 The Company recognizes that any changes in our actual fourth quarter 2024 or projected 2025 results could potentially have a material impact on our assessment of goodwill impairment. The Company will continue to monitor the actual performance of its operations against expectations and assess indicators of possible impairment. The valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is subject to a high degree of judgment, uncertainty and complexity. Should any indicators of impairment occur in subsequent periods, the Company will be required to perform an analysis in order to determine whether goodwill is impaired.

On May 23, 2024, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with First Merchants Bank (the "Bank"). The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a secured revolving credit facility, with an uncommitted accordion feature that provides for additional borrowing capacity of up to , subject to the Bank's approval and other customary terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility matures on May 23, 2027, subject to any earlier default under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to pay the entire unpaid principal balance of the revolving credit facility on the maturity date, subject to any earlier default under the Credit Agreement.

 The Company transforms environments through digital solutions by providing innovative digital signage solutions for key market segments and use cases, including: 

Retail 

Entertainment and Sports Venues 

Restaurants, including quick-serve restaurants QSR 

Convenience Stores 

Financial Services 

Automotive 

Medical and Healthcare Facilities 

Mixed Use Developments 

Corporate Communications, Employee Experience 

Digital out of Home DOOH Advertising Networks 

We serve market-leading companies, so there is a good chance that if you leave your home today to shop, work, eat, or play, you will encounter one or more of our digital signage experiences. Our solutions are increasingly visible because we help our enterprise customers achieve a range of business objectives, including: 

Increased brand awareness; 

Improved customer support; 

Enhanced employee productivity and satisfaction; 

Increased revenue and profitability; 

Improved guest experience; and 

Increased customer/guest engagement. 

Through a combination of organically grown platforms and a series of strategic acquisitions, the Company assists customers to design, deploy, manage, and monetize their digital signage networks. The Company sources leads and opportunities for its solutions through its digital and content marketing initiatives, close relationships with key industry partners, specifically equipment manufacturers, and the direct efforts of its in-house industry sales experts. Customer engagements focus on consultative conversations that ensure the Company s solutions are positioned to help customers achieve their business objectives in the most cost-effective manner possible. 

19

When comparing us to other digital signage providers, our customers value the following competitive advantages: 

Breadth of solutions Creative Realities offers a wide breadth of solutions to our customers. Creative Realities is one of only a few companies in the industry capable of providing the full portfolio of products and services required to implement and run an effective digital signage network. We leverage a single vendor approach, providing customers with a one-stop-shop for sourcing digital signage solutions from design through day two services. 

Managed labor pool Unlike most companies in our industry, we have a curated labor pool of qualified and vetted field technicians available to service customers quickly nationwide. We can meet tight schedules even in exceptionally large deployments and still ensure quality and consistency. 

In-house creative resources We assist customers in creating new content or repurposing existing content for digital signage experiences, an activity for which the Company has won several design awards in recent years. In each instance, our services can be essential in helping customers develop an effective content program. 

Network scalability and reliability Our SaaS content management platforms power some of the largest and most complex digital signage networks in North America, evidencing our ability to manage enterprise scale projects. This also provides us purchasing power to source products and services for our customers, enabling us to deliver cost effective, reliable and powerful solutions to small and medium size business customers. 

Ad management platform Our customers are increasingly interested in monetizing their digital signage networks through advertising content. However, efficiently scheduling advertising content into digital signage playlists to meet campaign objectives can be a challenging and labor-intensive process for our customers. AdLogic, our home-grown, content management-agnostic platform, automates this process, allowing network owners to capture more revenue with less expense. 

Media sales Few digital signage solution providers offer their customers media sales as a service. We have in-house media sales expertise to elevate conversations with our customers interested in better understanding network monetization. We believe this meaningful differentiation in the sales process provides us an additional revenue stream compared to our competitors. 

Market sector expertise Creative Realities has in-house experts in key market segments such as automotive, retail, QSRs, convenience stores, and DOOH advertising. Our expertise in these business segments enable our teams to provide meaningful business conversations and offer tailored solutions with prospects and customers to their unique business objectives. These experts build industry relationship and create thought leadership that drives lead flow and new opportunities for our business. 

Logistics Implementing a large digital signage project can be a logistical nightmare that can stall an initiative, even before deployment. Our expertise in logistics improves deployment efficiency, reduces delays and problems, and saves customers time and money. 

Technical support Digital signage networks present unique challenges for corporate IT departments. We simplify and improve end user support by leveraging our own NOC in Louisville, Kentucky. The NOC resolves many issues remotely and when field support is required, it can be dispatched quickly from the NOC, leveraging our managed labor pool to resolve customer issues quickly and effectively. 

Integrations and application development The future of digital signage is not still images and videos on a screen. We believe that interactive applications and integrations with other data sources will dominate the future. From social media feeds, mobile integrations, corporate data stores, or point of sale systems, our proven ability to build scalable applications and integrations is a key advantage that customers can leverage to deliver more compelling and engaging experiences for their customers. 

Hardware support A number of digital signage providers sell a proprietary media player or align themselves with just one operating system. We utilize a range of media players including Windows, Android and BrightSign to provide customers flexibility to select the appropriate hardware for any application knowing the entire network can still be served by a single digital signage platform, reducing complexity and improving the productivity of our customers. 

20

Our Sources of Revenue 
 
 The three primary sources of revenue for the Company are: 

Hardware sales from reselling digital signage hardware from original equipment manufacturers such as Samsung and BrightSign. 

Services revenue from helping customers design, deploy and manage their digital signage network, including: 

o 
 Hardware system design/engineering 

o 
 Hardware installation 

o 
 Content development 

o 
 Content scheduling 

o 
 Post-deployment network and field support 

o 
 Media sales 

Recurring subscription licensing and support revenue from our digital signage software platforms, which are generally sold via a SaaS model. Our platforms include: 

o 
 ReflectView , the Company s core digital signage platform for most applications, scalable and cost effective from 10 to 100,000+ devices; 

o 
 Reflect Xperience , a web-based interface that allows customers to give content scheduling access to local users via the web or mobile devices, while still maintaining centralized programming control; 

o 
 Reflect AdLogic , the Company s ad management platform for digital signage networks, which presently delivers approximately 50 million ads daily; 

o 
 Clarity , the Company s menu board solution, which has become a market leader for a range of restaurant and convenience store applications; 

o 
 Reflect Zero Touch , which allows customers to turn any screen into an interactive experience by allowing guests to engage using their mobile device; 

o 
 iShowroomProX , an omni-channel digital sales support platform targeted at original equipment manufacturers in the transportation sector, which integrates with dozens of key data services including dealer inventory at the VIN level; and 

o 
 OSx+ , a digital VIN-level checklist used to assist in the tracking and delivery of new vehicles in the transportation sector, providing measurable lift in customer satisfaction scores and connected vehicle enrollments and subscription activations. 

While hardware sales and support services revenues can fluctuate more significantly year over year based on new, large-scale network deployments, the Company expects to see continuous growth in recurring SaaS revenue for the foreseeable future as digital signage adoption/utilization continues to expand across the vertical markets we serve.

 Sales and marketing expenses generally include the salaries, taxes, and benefits of our sales and marketing personnel, as well as trade show activities, travel, and other related sales and marketing costs.

Interest Expense 
 
 See Note 7 Debt to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company s debt and related interest expense obligations. 
 
 Changes in fair value of contingent consideration 
 
 The Company has a contingent consideration arrangement related to the Merger to potentially pay additional cash amounts in future periods based on the lack of achievement of certain share price performance goals of our common stock. See Note 2 Section 11 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Contingent Consideration to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's obligations related to the contingent consideration arrangement. The contingent consideration arrangement is recorded at fair value and is classified as a liability on the acquisition date and is remeasured at each reporting period in accordance with ASC 805-30-35-1 using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The change in the period represents the mark-to-market adjustment as of the balance sheet date. 
 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt 
 
 The Company recognized a 1,059 loss on extinguishment of debt equal to the remaining unamortized portion of debt discount associated with the Acquisition Term Loan and Consolidation Term Loan as of May 23, 2024, the date the Company entered into the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Summary Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information 
 
 The following non-GAAP data, which adjusts for the categories of expenses described below, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Our management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful information for investors, shareholders and other stakeholders of our Company in gauging our results of operations on an ongoing basis. We believe that earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA is a performance measure and not a liquidity measure, and therefore a reconciliation between net (loss) income, a GAAP financial measure, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has been provided. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net (loss) income as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of cash flows, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity. In addition, EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP that are included elsewhere in this Report.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 See Note 1 Nature of Organization and Operations to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of liquidity and financial resources. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 The net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,750, compared to 8,306 for the same period in 2023. During the nine month period ending September 30, 2024, the Company generated net loss of 478, which included depreciation and amortization expense (inclusive of amortization of debt discount) of 2,901, a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 1,059, and a gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration of 414. The Company generated a 905 increase in cash as of September 30, 2024, provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,302, compared to 3,138 during the same period in 2023. We currently do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024. The reduction in capital expenditures in 2024 compared to the prior period was anticipated as the Company has been reducing third-party development resources utilized for the previously disclosed modernization and internationalization of our automotive platform, which launched to user acceptance testing during the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,490, compared to net cash provided from financing activities of 1,575 for the same period in 2023. Net cash used in financing activities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 is primarily the result of the repayment of related party term debt totaling 15,147, partially offset by net proceeds of 10,979 from borrowings and payments under the Company's revolving credit facility. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements set forth in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

 An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, and were designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item; however, the discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the Risk Factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, as amended on April 26, 2024, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 10, 2024, and subsequent filings made with the SEC. Such risks and uncertainties have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner. In addition, below is an updated risk factor for which you should be aware: 
 
 T he Guaranteed Consideration payable to former Reflect stockholders is an estimate only and is subject to change. Accordingly, the contingent liability that we book for payment of the Guaranteed Consideration is an estimate only, and the actual liability may differ. In addition, disputes over the proper calculation of the Guaranteed Consideration could result in litigation or arbitration . 
 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement governing the merger in which we acquired Reflect (the Merger ), shares of Reflect s capital were converted into the right to receive cash and a total of 2,333,334 shares of our common stock (the Merger Shares ). The Merger Agreement also requires us to make additional contingent cash payments to the former Reflect stockholders (the Guaranteed Consideration on or after February 17, 2025 (subject to a six-month extension under certain circumstances) (the Guarantee Date in an amount by which the value of our shares on the Guarantee Date is less than 6.40 per share (such applicable amount, the Guaranteed Price ), multiplied by the number of Merger Shares held by the Reflect stockholders on the Guarantee Date. The actual amount of Guaranteed Consideration cannot be determined until such time. 
 
 On March 23, 2023, the Company completed a 1-for-3 reverse stock split (the Reverse Split primarily intended to bring the Company into compliance with the minimum bid price requirement to maintain the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result of the Reverse Split, the number of Merger Shares decreased from 2,333,334 to 777,778. 
 
 Our financial statements have and continue to book a contingent liability for payment of the Guaranteed Consideration conservatively as though the Reverse Split resulted in an upward adjustment of the Guaranteed Price from 6.40 per share to 19.20 per share. Notwithstanding this accounting position, we have engaged in discussions with RSI Exit Corporation, as representative of the former Reflect stockholders RSI ), regarding the impact that the Reverse Split properly had on the calculation of the Guaranteed Consideration, given that the Merger Agreement provides for a Guaranteed Price of 6.40 per share and does not provide for any adjustment to the Guaranteed Price as a result of the Reverse Stock Split or other similar transaction with respect to our common stock. To date, the Company and RSI have not reached any agreement regarding the calculation of the Guaranteed Consideration under the plain terms of the Merger Agreement. 
 
 Ultimately, the Guaranteed Price may not be adjusted for the Reverse Split based on the terms of the Merger Agreement, and the contingent liability that we book for payment of the Guaranteed Consideration may differ from the amount ultimately paid. See Note 2 Section 11 Summary of Significant Policies - Contingent Consideration to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Report for a description of our obligations to pay the contingent consideration. 
 
 If we and RSI are ultimately unable to agree upon the proper calculation of the Guaranteed Consideration, the matter may result in litigation or arbitration. RSI may file claims against us for, among other things, failure to pay the correct amount for the Guaranteed Consideration once the payment due date occurs, which is anticipated to occur in February 2025. We cannot provide any certainty that our interpretation of the Merger Agreement, and position on the amount of the Guaranteed Consideration, will ultimately be accepted by RSI and the former Reflect stockholders, or by any arbitrator or court that ultimately adjudicates the matter. In addition, any claim will require significant time of management, and the Company will likely incur substantial expenses. If our interpretation of the Merger Agreement is not correct, we may be forced to cover the expenses of RSI in bringing such claim.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

Creative Realities Reports Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Results 

 25 Year-over-Year Top Line Revenue Growth; 53 increase in Adjusted EBITDA to 2.3 Million; On Track for Best Year Ever 

LOUISVILLE, KY November 13, 2024 Creative Realities, Inc. Creative Realities, CRI, or the Company (NASDAQ: CREX), a leading provider of digital signage and media solutions, today announced its financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Highlights: 

Record third quarter revenue of 14.4 million, up 25 from 11.6 million in the prior-year period 

Gross profit of 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus 5.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of 25 

Net Income improved by 1.9 million during third quarter, to breakeven, as compared to third quarter prior year 

Adjusted EBITDA of 2.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 versus 1.0 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 122 

Annual recurring revenue ARR of approximately 18.1 million at the end of the third quarter versus 18.0 million as of June 30, 2024 

Our financial results including third quarter record revenue and profitable bottom-line performance put us squarely on track for the Company s best year in its history, said Rick Mills, Chief Executive Officer. Revenue rose 25 year-over-year, and Adjusted EBITDA climbed to 2.3 million, as we moved closer to achieving many of our goals for fiscal 2024. Our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue rose to 15.8 in the quarter and to 11.5 year-to-date, bringing our trailing twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA to 7.4 million, or 13.6 of trailing twelve-month revenue. This Adjusted EBITDA is ahead of our prior projection of a 2024 exit run-rate of approximately 12 on revenue of 60 million. While the Company s active business development pipeline positions us positively for 2025 and beyond, we project a shortfall in revenue against our prior projections for the 2024 fourth quarter and the fiscal year as material opportunities have taken longer to finalize, contract, and deploy, thus pushing these projected revenues into 2025. We are confident that 2024 will represent record revenue and profitability under any scenario and remain excited about the future and committed to accelerating growth, expanding margins, optimizing our capital structure and, as always, increasing returns for our shareholders. 

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation is provided in the tables of this press release. 

2024 Third Quarter Financial Results 

Sales were 14.4 million for the fiscal 2024 third quarter, an increase of 2.9 million, or 25 , as compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. Hardware revenue was 5.2 million, versus 4.8 million in the prior-year period, while service revenue rose to 9.2 million from 6.7 million in fiscal 2023. Service growth was significant year-over-year reflecting strong demand and a higher installed base of business. 

Consolidated gross profit was 6.6 million for the fiscal 2024 third quarter versus 5.3 million in the prior-year period, and consolidated gross margin was 45.6 versus 45.8 in the fiscal 2023 third quarter. Gross margin on hardware revenue was 24.1 in fiscal 2024 as compared to 30.2 in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting product mix. Gross margin on service amounted to 57.9 , versus 57.1 in the fiscal 2023 third quarter. The Company anticipates margin expansion as revenue expands more quickly than the associated cost of deployment and support of those enhanced levels of revenue. Software subscription run-rates continued to rise, and the Company ended the quarter with record ARR of approximately 18.1 million on an annualized run rate. 

Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter rose to 1.5 million, versus 1.3 million in the prior-year period, reflecting enhanced investment in business development activities. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were 3.9 million versus 3.8 in fiscal 2023. 

The Company posted operating income of approximately 1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 0.2 million in fiscal 2023. CRI reported net income of 0.1 million, or 0.01 per diluted share, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 versus a net loss of 1.9 million, or (0.22) per diluted share, in the prior-year period. 

Adjusted EBITDA (defined later in this release) was 2.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 1.0 million in the prior-year period. 

Balance Sheet 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash on hand of approximately 0.9 million, versus 2.9 million at December 31, 2023. The Company had outstanding debt of approximately 11.0 million as of September 30, 2024 versus 15.1 million at the start of the fiscal year. As of the end of the third quarter, the trailing twelve-month gross and net leverage ratios utilizing Adjusted EBTIDA were 1.49x and 1.37x, respectively, versus 2.97x and 2.40x at the beginning of 2024. Net debt is equal to the Company s outstanding debt less cash on hand. 

Conference Call Details 

 The Company will host a conference call to review the results of the third quarter 2024, and provide additional commentary about recent performance, today, November 13, at 9:00 am Eastern Time, which will include prepared remarks and materials from management, followed by a live Q A. The call will be hosted by Rick Mills, Chief Executive Officer, and Will Logan, Chief Financial Officer. 

Prior to the call, participants should register at https://bit.ly/CRIearnings2024Q3 . Once registered, participants can use the weblink provided in the registration email to participate in the live webcast. An archived edition of the earnings conference call will also be posted on the Company s website later today and will remain available for one year. 

Use of Non-GAAP Measures 

 Creative Realities, Inc. prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company discloses information regarding EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. CRI defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. CRI defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, fair value adjustments and both cash and non-cash non-recurring gains and charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance defined in accordance with GAAP. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used internally in planning and evaluating the Company s operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that disclosure of these metrics offers investors, bankers and other stakeholders an additional view of the Company s operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the Company s financial results. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss) or to net cash used in operating activities as measures of operating results or liquidity. Our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and the measures exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating the Company s performance. A reconciliation of GAAP net income/(loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is included in the accompanying financial schedules. For further information, please refer to Creative Realities, Inc. s filings available online at www.sec.gov , including its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 21, 2024.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET LOSS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA 

 (in thousands, unaudited) 

Creative Realities, Inc. prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company discloses information regarding EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. CRI defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. CRI defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, fair value adjustments and both cash and non-cash non-recurring gains and charges. 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of CRI s profitability or liquidity. CRI s management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful financial metrics because they allow external users of CRI s financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, to more effectively evaluate CRI s operating performance, compare the results of its operations from period to period and against CRI s peers without regard to CRI s financing methods, hedging positions or capital structure and because it highlights trends in CRI s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. CRI also presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures of its performance that are frequently used by others in evaluating companies in its industry. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA CRI presents may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 

The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net loss, CRI s most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
