 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

, an increase of to the reserve for unfunded commitments, a decrease to retained earnings, and a tax benefit recorded as part of the deferred tax asset in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

In March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04 - Reference Rate Reform (Subtopic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU was effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, FASB Issued ASU 2022-06 to defer the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As a result of the phase out of LIBOR immediately after June 30, 2023, our loans that were indexed to LIBOR have transitioned to CME Term SOFR, as of September 30, 2024. 

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures ASU 2022-02 ). ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, ASU 2022-02 requires entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses - Measured at Amortized Cost. ASU 2022-02 became effective on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) . The amendments in this update permit reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. A reporting entity may make an accounting policy election to apply the proportional amortization method on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis rather than electing to apply the proportional amortization method at the reporting entity level or to individual investments. Previously, only Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments were eligible to apply the proportional amortization method. This ASU became effective on January 1, 2024. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07). The update requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, enhanced interim disclosure requirements, clarification for when multiple segment measures of profit or loss can be disclosed and other requirements intended to improve overall reportable segment disclosures in annual and interim periods. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company in the annual period beginning on January 1, 2024 and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2025 with retrospective application to all prior periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-07 to have a significant impact on its disclosures as the Company operates as a single segment and reporting unit. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 requires additional annual disclosures including further disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, additional information for reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold, further disaggregation of income taxes paid and other required disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company in the annual period beginning on January 1, 2025 and applied on a prospective basis with both early adoption and retrospective application permitted. The Company does not anticipate ASU 2023-09 to have a significant impact on its income tax disclosures or financial statements. 

and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were no sales of equity securities during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Consistent with ASC 321, Equity Securities, these securities are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Accordingly, the Company recognized a gain of during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and a loss of , during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to losses of and during the same periods of 2023. 

Debt Securities 

Debt securities have been classified in the financial statements as available for sale. The amortized cost and estimated fair values of debt securities as of September 30, 2024 are as follows: 

Collateralized mortgage obligations 

Municipalities 

SBA pools 

Corporate debt 

Asset backed securities 

The following table details the gross unrealized losses and fair values of debt securities aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024. 

Collateralized mortgage obligations 

Municipalities 

SBA pools 

Corporate debt 

Asset backed securities 

Total temporarily impaired securities 

For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, management evaluates whether the decline in fair value is a reflection of credit deterioration or other factors. In performing this evaluation, management considers the extent which fair value has fallen below amortized cost, changes in ratings by rating agencies, and other information indicating a deterioration in repayment capacity of either the underlying issuer or the borrowers providing repayment capacity in a securitization. If management s evaluation indicates that a credit loss exists then a present value of the expected cash flows is calculated and compared to the amortized cost basis of the security in question and, to the degree that the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value, an allowance for credit loss ACL is established, with the caveat that the maximum amount of the reserve on any individual security is the difference between the fair value and amortized cost balance of the security in question. Any unrealized loss that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income. As of September 30, 2024, accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale securities was and is not included in the tables within this footnote. 

The unrealized losses are due primarily to rising market yields and not due to credit deterioration. As such, no ACL on available-for-sale securities has been established as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security. 

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities as of September 30, 2024, segregated by contractual maturity or call date, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

Due after one year through five years 

Due after five years through ten years 

Due after ten years 

The amortized cost and estimated fair values of debt securities as of December 31, 2023 are as follows: 

Collateralized mortgage obligations 

Municipalities 

SBA pools 

Corporate debt 

Asset backed securities 

The following tables detail the gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated of debt securities by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2023.

There were no sales of available-for-sale securities during the three-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company sold eighteen available-for-sale securities during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 with a book value of , resulting in gross gains of , as compared to available-for-sale securities sold with a book value of , resulting in gross losses of and gross gains of , for a net gain of during the nine-months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, the Company recognized a net gain of and on called securities during the three and nine-month periods ended June, 2024, respectively, as compared to gains of during the comparable 2023 periods. 

Debt securities carried at and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were pledged to secure deposits of public funds.

Loan Origination/Risk Management. The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. 

Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Once it is determined that the borrower s management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen, the Company s management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 

Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce the Company s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. As a general rule, the Company avoids financing single-purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk. The Company also utilizes third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas it serves. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner occupied loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 35 of the outstanding principal balance of the Company s commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties. 

With respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by non-owner occupied properties that the Company may originate from time to time, the Company generally requires the borrower to have had an existing relationship with the Company and have a proven record of success. 

Construction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Significant events can affect the construction industry, including: the inherent volatility of real estate markets and vulnerability to delays due to weather, change orders, inability to obtain construction permits, labor or material shortages, and price changes. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. 

Consumer loans are originated utilizing a computer-based credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis. Underwriting standards for home equity loans follow bank policy, which include, but are not limited to, a maximum loan-to-value percentage of , a maximum housing and total debt ratio of and , respectively and other specified credit and documentation requirements. 

Agricultural loans largely consist of real estate loans, development loans, and operating facilities to support crop production, livestock, dairy, and other agricultural interests. Agricultural loans are especially vulnerable to two risk factors that are largely outside the control of the Company and borrowers: commodity prices and weather conditions. Other environmental factors such as the availability of water will also affect the production of crops. Underwriting practices include estimating future repayment sources based on information taken from the customer, peer reports, or appraisals. With the cyclicality of agricultural operations, increased focus is placed on access to liquidity and equity to support the operations when faced with unfavorable industry trends as well as the sponsor s industry experience. 

The Company maintains an independent loan review function that validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company s policies and procedures. 

Non-Accrual and Past Due Loans. Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. 

No loans were on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023.

Collateral Dependent Loans. Management s evaluation as to the ultimate collectability of loans includes estimates regarding future cash flows from operations and the value of property, real and personal, pledged as collateral. These estimates are affected by changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of borrowers. Under CECL, loans can be determined to be collateral dependent if foreclosure of the loan s underlying collateral is probable or as a practical expedient if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. Loans are written down to the lower of cost or fair value of underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell. The Company had no collateral dependent loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Loan Modification Disclosures Pursuant to ASU 2022-02 - The Company may agree to different types of concessions when modifying a loan. There were no loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, including principal forgiveness, rate reductions, payment deferral or term extension, during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Loan Risk Grades Quality ratings (Risk Grades) are assigned to all commitments and stand-alone notes. Risk grades define the basic characteristics of commitments or stand-alone note in relation to their risk. All loans are graded using a system that maximizes the loan quality information contained in loan review grades, while ensuring that the system is compatible with the grades used by bank examiners. 

The Company grades loans using the following letter system: 

1 Exceptional Loan 

 2 Quality Loan 

 3A Better Than Acceptable Loan 

 3B Acceptable Loan 

 3C Marginally Acceptable Loan 

 4 (W) Watch Acceptable Loan 

 5 Special Mention Loan 

 6 Substandard Loan 

 7 Doubtful Loan 

 8 Loss 

1. Exceptional Loan - Loans with A+ credits that contain very little, if any, risk. Grade 1 loans are considered Pass. To qualify for this rating, the following characteristics must be present: 

A high level of liquidity and whose debt-servicing capacity exceeds expected obligations by a substantial margin. 

Where leverage is below average for the industry and earnings are consistent or growing without severe vulnerability to economic cycles. 

Also included in this rating (but not mandatory unless one or more of the preceding characteristics are missing) are loans that are fully secured and properly margined by our own time instruments or U.S. blue chip securities. To be properly margined, cash collateral must be equal to, or greater than, of the loan amount. 

2. Quality Loan - Loans with excellent sources of repayment that conform in all respects to bank policy and regulatory requirements. These are also loans for which little repayment risk has been identified. No credit or collateral exceptions. Grade 2 loans are considered Pass. Other factors include: 

Unquestionable debt-servicing capacity to cover all obligations in the ordinary course of business from well-defined primary and secondary sources. 

Consistent strong earnings. 

A solid equity base. 

3A. Better than Acceptable Loan - In the interest of better delineating the loan portfolio s true credit risk for reserve allocation, further granularity has been sought by splitting the grade 3 category into three classifications. The distinction between the three are bank-defined guidelines and represent a further refinement of the regulatory definition of a pass, or grade 3 loan. Grade 3A is characterized by: 

Strong earnings with no loss in last three years and ample cash flow to service all debt well above policy guidelines. 

Long term experienced management with depth and defined management succession. 

The loan has no exceptions to policy. 

Loan-to-value on real estate secured transactions is 10 to 20 less than policy guidelines. 

Very liquid balance sheet that may have cash available to pay off our loan completely. 

Little to no debt on balance sheet. 

3B. Acceptable Loan - 3B loans are simply defined as all loans that are less qualified than 3A loans and are stronger than 3C loans. These loans are characterized by acceptable sources of repayment that conform to bank policy and regulatory requirements. Repayment risks are acceptable for these loans. Credit or collateral exceptions are minimal, are in the process of correction, and do not represent repayment risk. These loans: 

Are those where the borrower has average financial strengths, a history of profitable operations and experienced management. 

Are those where the borrower can be expected to handle normal credit needs in a satisfactory manner. 

3C. Marginally Acceptable Loan - 3C loans have similar characteristics as that of 3Bs with the following additional characteristics: 

Requires collateral. 

A credit facility where the borrower has average financial strengths, but usually lacks reliable secondary sources of repayment other than the subject collateral. 

Other common characteristics can include some or all of the following: minimal background experience of management, lacking continuity of management, a start-up operation, erratic historical profitability (acceptable reasons-well identified), lack of or marginal sponsorship of guarantor, and government guaranteed loans. 

4(W). Watch Acceptable Loan - Watch grade will be assigned to any credit that is adequately secured and performing but monitored for a number of indicators. These characteristics may include: 

Any unexpected short-term adverse financial performance from budgeted projections or a prior period s results (i.e., declining profits, sales, margins, cash flow, or increased reliance on leverage, including adverse balance sheet ratios, trade debt issues, etc.). 

Any managerial or personal problems with company management, decline in the entire industry or local economic conditions, or failure to provide financial information or other documentation as requested. 

Issues regarding delinquency, overdrafts, or renewals. 

Any other issues that cause concern for the company. 

Loans to individuals or loans supported by guarantors with marginal net worth and/or marginal collateral. 

Weaknesses that are identified are short-term in nature. 

Loans in this category are usually accounts the Bank would want to retain providing a positive turnaround can be expected within a reasonable time frame. Grade 4(W) loans are considered Pass. 

5. Special Mention Loan - A special mention extension of credit is defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or the institution s credit position. Extensions of credit that might be detailed in this category include the following: 

The lending officer may be unable to properly supervise the credit because of an inadequate loan or credit agreement. 

Questions exist regarding the condition of and/or control over collateral. 

Economic or market conditions may unfavorably affect the obligor in the future. 

A declining trend in the obligor s operations or an imbalanced position in the balance sheet exists, but not to the point that repayment is jeopardized. 

6. Substandard Loan - A substandard extension of credit is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Extensions of credit so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard credits, does not have to exist in individual extensions of credit classified as substandard. 

7. Doubtful Loan - An extension of credit classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition, liquidation proceedings, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans. The entire loan need not be classified as doubtful when collection of a specific portion appears highly probable. 

8. Loss - Extensions of credit classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the credit has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off, even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. It should not be the Company s practice to attempt long-term recoveries while the credit remains on the books. Losses should be taken in the period in which they surface as uncollectible. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there are no loans that are classified with risk grades of 8- Loss. 

The risk grades are reviewed every month, at a minimum and on an as-needed basis depending on the specific circumstances of the loan.

Allowance for Credit Losses ACL ). As noted in Note 2, as required by ASU 2016-13, on January 1, 2023 the Company implemented CECL and increased our ACL, previously the allowance for loan losses, with a cumulative adjustment. Under ASU 2016-13, the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the related loan s amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The Company s ACL is calculated monthly, with any difference in the calculated ACL and the recorded ACL trued-up through an entry to the provision for credit losses. Management calculates the quantitative portion of collectively evaluated reserves for all loan categories, using a discounted cash flow DCF methodology. For purposes of estimating the Company s ACL, management generally evaluates collectively evaluated loans by Federal Call code in order to group loans with similar risk characteristics together, however management has grouped loans in selected call codes together in determining portfolio segments, due to similar risk characteristics and reserve methodologies used for certain call code classifications. 

The DCF quantitative reserve methodology incorporates the consideration of probability of default PD and loss given default LGD estimates to estimate periodic losses. The PD estimates are derived through the application of reasonable and supportable economic forecasts to call code specific regression models, derived from the consideration of historical bank-specific and peer loss-rate data. The loss rate data has been regressed against benchmark economic indicators, for which reasonable and supportable forecasts exist, in the development of the call-code specific regression models. Regression models are generally refreshed on an annual basis, in order to pull in more recent loss rate data. Reasonable and supportable forecasts of the selected economic metric are then input into the regression model to calculate an expected default rate. The expected default rates are then applied to expected monthly loan balances estimated through the consideration of contractual repayment terms and expected prepayments. The Company utilizes a four-quarter forecast period, after which the expected default rates revert to the historical average for each call code, over a four-quarter reversion period, on a straight-line basis. The prepayment assumptions applied to expected cash flow over the contractual life of the loans are estimated based on historical, bank-specific experience, peer data and the consideration of current and expected conditions and circumstances including the level of interest rates. The prepayment assumptions may be updated by Management in the event that changing conditions impact Management s estimate or additional historical data gathered has resulted in the need for a reevaluation. LGD utilized in the DCF is derived from the application of the Frye-Jacobs theory which relates LGD to PD based on historical peer data, as calculated by a third-party. The call code regression models utilized upon implementation of CECL on January 1, 2023, and as of September 30, 2024, were identical, and relied upon reasonable and supportable forecasts of the National Unemployment Rate. Some of the call code regression models also use the Real Gross Domestic Product. Management selected the National Unemployment Rate and the Real Gross Domestic Product as the drivers of quantitative portion of collectively reserves on loan classes reliant upon the DCF methodology, primarily as a result of high correlation coefficients identified in regression modeling, the availability of forecasts including the quarterly FOMC forecast, and given the widespread familiarity of stakeholders with this economic metric. 

Management recognizes that there are additional factors impacting risk of loss in the loan portfolio beyond what is captured in the quantitative portion of reserves on collectively evaluated loans. As current and expected conditions, may vary compared with conditions over the historical lookback period, which is utilized in the calculation of quantitative reserves, management considers whether additional or reduced reserve levels on collectively evaluated loans may be warranted given the consideration of a variety of qualitative factors. Several of the following qualitative factors Q-factors considered by management reflect the legacy regulatory guidance on Q-factors, whereas several others represent factors unique to the Company or unique to the current time period. 

Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices 

Changes in international, regional and local economic and business conditions, and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, as reflected in forecasts of the California unemployment rate 

Changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio 

Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff 

Changes in the volume and severity of past due, watch loans and classified loans 

Changes in the quality of the Bank s loan review processes 

Changes in the value of underlying collateral for loans not identified as collateral dependent 

Changes in loan categorization concentrations 

Other external factors, which include, the regulatory risk ratings. 

The qualitative portion of the Company s reserves on collectively evaluated loans are calculated using a combination of numeric frameworks and management judgement, to determine risk categorizations in each of the Q-factors presented above. The amount of qualitative reserves is also contingent upon the relative weighting of Q-factors according to management s judgement. 

Loans identified as losses by management, internal loan review and/or bank examiners are charged-off. Furthermore, consumer loan accounts are charged-off automatically based on regulatory requirements. 

Accrued interest receivable for loans is included in the Interest receivable and other assets line item on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company elected not to measure an allowance for accrued interest receivable and instead elected to reverse accrued interest income on loans that are placed on nonaccrual status. The Company believes this policy results in the timely reversal of uncollectible interest. 

The following table details activity in the ACL by portfolio segment for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories.

The loan recoveries of recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of two loans to different borrowers, both of which date back to the recession period approximately 15 years ago in which collateral values were considerably depressed. One of the loans was acquired in 2015 when we completed a bank acquisition. The loan recoveries initially increased the ACL, which subsequently resulted in the reversal of .

CECL day-one adjustment 

Reversal of provision to Operations for Off Balance Sheet Commitments 

Balance, end of period 

The method for calculating the reserve for off-balance-sheet loan commitments is based on a historical funding rate applied to the undisbursed loan amount to estimate an average outstanding amount during the life of the loan commitment. Then, a historic loss rate as computed by our CECL model is applied to the estimated average outstanding balance to calculate the off-balance-sheet reserve amount. The funding rates, historic loss rates and resulting reserve amount for off-balance-sheet commitments are evaluated by management periodically as part of the CECL procedures. Reserves for off-balance-sheet commitments are recorded in interest payable and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans carried at and , respectively, were pledged as collateral on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.

Available-for-sale and equity securities - Investment securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions, and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. Securities classified as Level 3 include asset-backed securities in less liquid markets where significant inputs are unobservable. 

Loans Evaluated Individually - The Company does not record portfolio loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, periodically, a loan is evaluated individually and is reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. If the collateral value is not sufficient, a specific reserve is recorded. Collateral values are estimated using a combination of observable inputs, including recent appraisals, and unobservable inputs based on customized discounting criteria. Due to the significance of unobservable inputs, fair values of individually evaluated collateral dependent loans have been classified as Level 3. 

There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and therefore may involve risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the Company s actual results to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the Company s forward-looking statements. These statements generally appear with words such as will, anticipate, target, believe, estimate, forecast , enhance, may, intend, plan, goal, believe, forecast, project, outlook, expect or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact and may include those that discuss, among others, our strategies, goals, plans, outlook, forecasts, expectations, intentions or other non-historical matters; future operations, financial condition, results of operations, or business developments; and the assumptions that underlie these matters. Although management believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from results discussed in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the credit exposure of certain loan products and other components of our business that could be impacted by the changing economic and business conditions; changes in monetary, fiscal or tax policy to address changing economic conditions including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board, any of which could cause us to incur additional loan losses and adversely affect our results of operations in the future; economic conditions (both generally and in the markets where the Company operates) including unemployment levels, energy prices, increased energy costs in California, inflation, supply chain issues, a decline in housing prices or collateral values and the risk of a recession or slowed economic growth in the United States economy; the continuing impact of the changing economic conditions on our employees and customers, including consumer income, creditworthiness, confidence, spending and savings; the credit quality of borrowers; increasing geopolitical instability, including the war between Russia and Ukraine and the impact of sanctions; the success of our efforts to mitigate the impact of the changing economic conditions; competition from other providers of financial services offered by the Company and our response to competitive pressures; changes in government regulation and legislation; the impact of any failure by the U.S. government to increase the debt ceiling or any federal government shutdown; changes in interest rates and interest rate fluctuations; volatility in the capital markets; the amount and rate of deposit growth and changes in deposit costs; material unforeseen changes in the financial stability and liquidity of the Company s credit customers; risks associated with concentrations in real estate related loans; our ability to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels or to comply with revised capital or liquidity requirements; changes in accounting standards and interpretations; changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; the soundness of other financial institutions, including disruptions, instability and failures in the banking industry; physical or transition risks related to climate change; cybersecurity risks and heightened legislative and regulatory focus on cybersecurity and data privacy; and other risks as may be detailed from time to time in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are difficult to predict and which may be beyond the control of the Company. Many of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are, and will be, exacerbated by the worsening of the global business and economic environment. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after the date of this discussion or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

The following discussion explains the significant factors affecting the Company s operations and financial position for the periods presented. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear or that are referenced to elsewhere in this report, and with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Average balances, including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios, are generally comprised of average daily balances. 

The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company s financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion and analysis includes management s insight of the Company s financial condition and results of operations of Oak Valley Bancorp and its subsidiary. Unless otherwise stated, the Company refers to the consolidated entity, Oak Valley Bancorp, while the Bank refers to Oak Valley Community Bank.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation and uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical to our financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain, (ii) management could have applied different assumptions during the reported period, and (iii) changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur in the future and could have a material impact on our financial statements. Management has determined the following accounting estimates and related policies to be critical: 

Goodwill Impairment - The Company applies a qualitative analysis of conditions in order to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value is impaired. In the event that the qualitative analysis suggests that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, the Company uses several quantitative valuation methodologies in evaluating goodwill for impairment that includes assumptions and estimates made concerning the future earnings potential of the organization, and a market-based approach that looks at values for organizations of comparable size, structure and business model. 

Estimates of fair value are based on a complex model using, among other things, estimated cash flows and industry pricing multiples. The Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 (the Measurement Date), and quarterly if a triggering event causes concern of a possible goodwill impairment charge. At each Measurement Date, the Company, in accordance with ASC 350-20-35-3, evaluates, based on the weight of evidence, the significance of all qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units is less than its carrying amount. 

The assessment of qualitative factors at the most recent Measurement Date (December 31, 2023), indicated that it was not more likely than not that impairment existed; as a result, no further testing was performed. 

Allowance for Credit Losses - Credit risk is inherent in the business of lending and making commercial loans. Accounting for our allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events. At least on a quarterly basis, our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of allowance for credit losses and reports its assessment to the Board of Directors for its review and approval. 

The allowance for credit losses is an estimate dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loans, qualitative factors, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area. See Note 2 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, and the Provision for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses sections of this discussion and analysis for more information on the establishment of the Allowance for Credit Losses and the implementation of CECL. 

Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled using the liability method. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. 

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and the State of California. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020.

Fair Value Measurements - We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Securities available for sale, derivatives, and loans held for sale, if any, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as certain impaired loans held for investment and securities held to maturity that are other-than-temporarily impaired. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets due to application of lower-of-cost or market accounting. 

We have established and documented a process for determining fair value. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. Whenever there is no readily available market data, management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements. For detailed information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Item 1 of this report. 

Overview of Results of Operations and Financial Condition 

The purpose of this summary is to provide an overview of the items that management focuses on when evaluating the condition of the Company and its success in implementing its business and shareholder value strategies. The Company s business strategy is to operate the Bank as a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community-oriented bank. The Company s shareholder value strategy has three major objectives: (1) enhancing shareholder value; (2) making its retail banking franchise more valuable; and (3) efficiently utilizing its capital. 

Management believes the following were important factors in the Company s performance during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024: 

The Company recognized net income of 7,324,000 and 18,940,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 7,354,000 and 24,983,000 for the same periods in 2023. The net income decreases were mainly due to higher interest rates on deposit accounts, and an increase in operating expenses. 

The Company recorded a credit loss provision reversal of 1,620,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to credit loss provisions of 300,000 and a reversal of 160,000 during the comparable periods of 2023, mainly due to loan recoveries totaling 1,992,000, as described below. 

Net interest income decreased 1,283,000 and 5,700,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The net interest income decrease was mainly due to an increase in interest expense on deposit accounts. 

Non-interest income increased by 280,000 and 249,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to unrealized fair value gains on equity securities, and a positive variance in investment advisory service fees. 

Non-interest expense increased by 746,000 and 4,072,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily due to staffing increases and overhead related to servicing the growing business portfolios. 

Total assets increased by 58,033,000 or 3.1 , total net loans increased by 57,953,000 or 5.8 and investment securities decreased by 604,000 or 0.1 in each case from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, while deposits increased by 39,767,000 or 2.4 for the same period. Consequently, cash and cash equivalent balances decreased by 2,661,000 or 1.2 .

Income Summary 

For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net income of 7,324,000 and 18,940,000, respectively, representing decreases of 30,000 and 6,043,000, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Return on average assets (annualized) was 1.56 and 1.38 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 1.57 and 1.76 for the same periods in 2023. Annualized return on average common equity was 16.54 and 14.90 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 19.85 and 23.71 for the same periods in 2023. Net income before provisions for income taxes increased by 171,000 and decreased by 8,063,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from the same periods in 2023.

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the largest source of the Company s operating income. For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was 17,655,000 and 52,188,000, respectively, which represents decreases of 1,283,000 and 5,700,000, from the comparable periods in 2023. The decrease was due to rising interest rates on deposit accounts, as the average cost of funds increased to 0.83 and 0.75 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 0.33 and 0.20 in the same periods of 2023. The Company has increased rates on certain accounts and deposit products in order to remain competitive to our peer group and to maintain current liquidity levels, which remains at a high level. 

The net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets) was 4.04 and 4.08 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 4.34 and 4.39 for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in net interest margin is primarily due to the rising interest rates on deposit accounts, as discussed above. 

The FOMC increased rates in 2022 and 2023 and kept interest rates elevated until a recent rate cut in September of 2024. The higher interest rates have continued to have a positive impact on repricing of earning asset yields, which partially offset the higher cost of funds. The earning asset yield increased by 17 and 20 basis points for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023.

The table above reflects a decrease of 2,845,000 in net interest income due to changes in volume combined with the overall change in mix of balances during the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023. Changes in earning asset yields and rates on interest-bearing liabilities resulted in a decrease of 3,256,000 to net interest income, over the same period. This decrease was mainly due to higher interest rates paid on deposit accounts. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Company makes provisions for credit losses when required to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate for the level of risk in the loan portfolio. At least quarterly, management conducts an assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio and general economic trends in the local market. The determination of the appropriate level for the allowance is based on that review, considering such factors as historical experience, the volume and type of lending conducted, the amount of and identified potential loss associated with specific non-performing loans, regulatory policies, general economic conditions, and other factors, including reasonable and supportable forecasts, related to the collectability of loans in the portfolio. 

The Company recorded a reversal of provisions for credit losses of 1,620,000 during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, as compared to provisions of 300,000 and provision reversals of 160,000 during the same periods of 2023, as determined by the output of our CECL internal credit risk model. Loan recoveries totaled 2.0 million during the third quarter of 2024, which consisted of two loans that dated back to the recession. The net impact of the 2.0 million loan recoveries and the 358,000 increase in the ACL calculation resulted in the reversal of ACL provisions totaling 1.62 million. Credit quality remained strong with non-accrual loans remaining at a zero balance throughout the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024. Management will continue to closely monitor the credit risks to our loan portfolio and may need to make qualitative adjustments depending on factors that may impact the economy and the financial condition of our borrowers.

Service charges on deposits decreased by 51,000 and 110,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease was due to a change in the fees charged to deposit customers for non-sufficient fund and overdraft items that took effect in January 2024. 

Debit card transaction fee income decreased by 23,000 and 25,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease is attributable to normal fluctuations in electronic payment methods. 

Earnings on cash surrender value of life insurance increased by 91,000 and 186,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, corresponding to higher yields earned in 2024 and three additional policies that were purchased during the second quarter of 2024. 

Mortgage commissions increased by 1,000 and 7,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023. Overall, the demand for home purchases and refinancing has decreased in 2023 and 2024 compared to prior years, mainly due to higher interest rates. 

Gains on sales and calls of available-for-sale securities decreased by 13,000 and 42,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, as there was eighteen securities sold during the first nine months of 2024, compared to twenty-four securities sold during the same period of 2023. 

Other income increased by 275,000 and 233,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, mainly due to higher production from investment advisory services, and positive changes in the fair value of one equity security.

Non-interest expenses increased by 746,000 or 7.1 and 4,072,000 or 13.4 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023. Salaries and employee benefits increased by 672,000 and 2,420,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods of 2023, mainly due to additional staffing expense required to support the continued growth of our business portfolios. 

Occupancy expenses decreased by 12,000 and 35,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, due to a decline in fixed asset depreciation and general operating costs related to branch facilities. 

Data processing fees decreased by 129,000 and increased by 81,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023. The QTD decreases were related to online banking upgrades during the third quarter of 2023. YTD increases were primarily due to servicing costs on the growing number of loan and deposit accounts. 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation DFPI regulatory assessments decreased by 65,000 and increased by 70,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The QTD decrease is related to a decline in average deposits compared to the prior year. The YTD increase was due to the FDIC increasing the base rate to 0.05 , on an annual basis, for all member banks in order to build up the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC adopted a final rule in June 2022, applicable to all insured depository institutions, to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The final rule became effective as of January 1, 2023, with an invoice payment date of June 30, 2023. The FDIC said that the increase in assessment rate schedules is intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance fund reaches the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. The final assessment rate for financial institutions is determined by making adjustments to the base rate for various credit quality factors and other risk metrics of the institution as defined by the FDIC. The Company s risk profile and the related assessment rate remains at a relatively low level due to our strong credit quality, earnings and risk-based capital ratios. Management recognizes that assessments could increase further depending on deposit growth throughout the remainder of 2024, as the FDIC assessment rates are applied to average quarterly total liabilities as the primary basis, and based on FDIC s discretion to increase the base assessment rate as needed to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund. Moreover, the FDIC retains the authority and discretion to increase base assessment rates for banking entities in the future, as circumstances warrant. 

Other expense increased by 280,000 and 1,536,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was mainly due to advertising expenses from a marketing campaign launched during the first quarter of 2024 to attract new customers, in combination with various general operating expense increases, which is expected given the expansion of the Company s business portfolios. 

Management anticipates that non-interest expense will continue to increase as the Company continues to grow. However, management remains committed to cost-control and efficiency, and expects to keep these increases to a minimum relative to growth.

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded provisions for income taxes of 2,473,000 and 5,524,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, representing an increase of 201,000 and a decrease of 2,020,000, compared to the provisions recorded in the comparable periods of 2023. The effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 25.2 and 22.6 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 23.6 and 23.2 for the comparable periods of 2023. These provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income, and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes (such as earnings on qualified municipal securities, bank owned life insurance and certain tax-exempt loans). The disparity between the effective tax rates for the year-to-date period of 2023 as compared to 2024 is primarily due to tax credits from low-income housing projects as well as tax-free income on municipal securities and loans that comprised a larger proportion of pre-tax income in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase in the third quarter effective tax rate to 25.2 is related to cumulative YTD adjustments due to decreases in the balances of tax-exempt municipal investment securities. 

Asset Quality 

Non-performing assets consist of loans on non-accrual status, including loans restructured on non-accrual status, where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest and other real estate owned OREO ). 

Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due, unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection. The past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized, but collection efforts are continuously pursued. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some changes in financial status, causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms, and where management believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which management intends to offer for sale. 

Non-accrual loans totaled 0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loan modifications pursuant to ASU 2022-02, and therefore there were no payment delinquencies on modified loans during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no OREO properties. There were no sales, acquisitions or fair value adjustments of OREO properties during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Due to credit risk inherent in the lending business, the Company routinely sets aside allowances through charges to earnings. Such charges are not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio, but also for off-balance sheet items, such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit. Charges for the outstanding loan portfolio have been credited to the allowance for credit losses, whereas charges for off-balance sheet items have been credited to the reserve for off-balance sheet items, which is presented as a component of other liabilities. The Company recorded a reversal of credit loss provisions of 1,620,000 during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a provision of 300,000 and a provision reversal of 160,000 recorded during the same periods of 2023. The Company recorded provision reversals of 44,000 and 122,000 for off-balance sheet items during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to provision reversals of 84,000 and 506,000 recorded during the same periods of 2023. 

The allowance for credit losses increased by 583,000 to 11,479,000 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 10,896,000 as of December 31, 2023, due to net loan recoveries of 2,242,000 during the first nine months of 2024. Recoveries totaled 1,992,000 during the third quarter of 2024, due to two loan recoveries that dated back to the recession period and prior to a bank acquisition completed in 2015, from which one of the loans was acquired. The increases in the ACL and gross loans were consistent, and therefore the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans remained at 1.07 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The Company will continue to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and make additions to the allowance in accordance with the analysis referred to above. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, actual results may differ from management s estimate of credit losses and the related allowance. 

The Company makes provisions for credit losses when required to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate for the level of risk in the loan portfolio. At least quarterly, management conducts an assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio and general economic trends in the local market. The determination of the appropriate level for the allowance is based on that review, considering such factors as historical experience, the volume and type of lending conducted, the amount of and identified potential loss associated with specific non-performing loans, regulatory policies, general economic conditions, and other factors related to the collectability of loans in the portfolio. 

Although management believes the allowance as of September 30, 2024 was adequate to absorb expected credit losses from any known and inherent risks in the portfolio, no assurance can be given that the adverse effect of current and future economic conditions on the Company s service areas, or other variables, will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future. 

Investment Activities 

Investments are a key source of interest income. Management of the investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by the Company s Investment Committee. Investment balances, including cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, are subject to change over time based on the Company s asset/liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. The Company s liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits, and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs. 

Cash Equivalents 

The Company holds federal funds sold, unpledged available-for-sale securities and salable government guaranteed loans to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had 213,907,000 and 216,568,000, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. 

Investment Securities 

Management of the investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing an interest rate-sensitive position, while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk. Investment securities that the Company intends to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities, and all other investment securities are classified as available-for-sale or equity securities. Currently, all of the investment securities are classified as available-for-sale except for one mutual fund classified as an equity security with a carrying value of 3,274,000 as of September 30, 2024. The carrying values of available-for-sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income. The carrying values of equity securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses through noninterest income in the consolidated statement of income. 

36

Table of Contents 

For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, management evaluates whether the decline in fair value is a reflection of credit deterioration or other factors. In performing this evaluation, management considers the extent which fair value has fallen below amortized cost, changes in ratings by rating agencies, and other information indicating a deterioration in repayment capacity of either the underlying issuer or the borrowers providing repayment capacity in a securitization. If management s evaluation indicates that a credit loss exists then a present value of the expected cash flows is calculated and compared to the amortized cost basis of the security in question and to the degree that the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value an allowance for credit loss ACL is established, with the caveat that the maximum amount of the reserve on any individual security is the difference between the fair value and amortized cost balance of the security in question. Any unrealized loss that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income. 

The unrealized losses are due primarily to rising market yields and not due to credit deterioration. As such, no ACL on available-for-sale securities has been established as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security. 

Low Income Housing Tax Credit Funds 

During 2018 and 2022, we committed to invest 5 million and 10.5 million, respectively, in low-income housing tax credit funds LIHTC to promote our participation in CRA activities, which had unfunded commitments of 7,164,000 and 9,781,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For LIHTC investments, we receive the return in the form of tax credits and tax deductions over a period of approximately 15 years. 

Deposits 

Total deposits as of September 30, 2024 were 1,690,301,000, an increase of 39,767,000 or 2.4 from the deposit total of 1,650,534,000 as of December 31, 2023. Average deposits decreased by 84,279,000 to 1,640,761,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.

Because the Company s client base is comprised primarily of commercial and industrial accounts, individual account balances are generally higher than those of consumer-oriented banks. Five clients carry deposit balances of more than 1 of total deposits, one of which had a deposit balance of more than 3 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. Management believes that the Company s funding concentration risk is not significant and is mitigated by the ample sources of funds the Bank has access to. 

The YTD deposit increase is attributable to an advertising campaign that we launched in January 2024, in order to increase our market share of deposit balances. The number of DDA checking accounts has increased over the prior nine months, demonstrating the effectiveness of this endeavor and that our core deposit base has continued to expand. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for more information. 

Since the deposit growth strategy emphasizes core deposit growth, the Company has avoided relying on brokered deposits as a consistent source of funds. The Company had no brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Borrowings 

Although deposits are the primary source of funds for lending and investment activities and for general business purposes, the Company may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB as an alternative to retail deposit funds. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding FHLB advances or borrowings of any kind, as the Company continues to rely on deposit growth as its primary source of funding. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for the details on the FHLB borrowings program. 

Capital Ratios 

The Company is regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank FRB and is subject to the securities registration and public reporting regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a California state-chartered bank, the Company s banking subsidiary is subject to primary supervision, examination and regulation by the DFPI and the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board is the primary federal regulator of state member banks. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures the Bank s deposits as permitted by law. Management is not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on the Company s or Bank s liquidity, capital resources, or operations. 

The U.S. Basel III rules contain capital standards regarding the composition of capital, minimum capital ratios and counter-party credit risk capital requirements. The Basel III rules also include a definition of common equity Tier 1 capital and require that certain levels of such common equity Tier 1 capital be maintained. The rules also include a capital conservation buffer, which imposes a common equity requirement above the new minimum that can be depleted under stress and could result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses under certain circumstances, as well as a new standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Under the Basel III rules, we must maintain a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6 , a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8 and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 . In addition to the preceding requirements, all financial institutions subject to the Rules, including both the Company and the Bank, are required to establish a "conservation buffer," consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, which is at least 2.5 above each of the preceding common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based ratio and the total risk-based ratio. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements and operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company s and Bank s amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

Proposed new rules for U.S. implementation of capital requirements under Basel IV rules, more recently referred to as the Basel III "Endgame", were issued by the U.S. federal banking agencies on July 27, 2023. These proposed rules include broad-based changes to the risk-weighting framework for various credit exposures and operational risk capital requirements. However, the proposed rules generally apply only to large banking organizations with total assets of 100 billion or more, and hence, would not be applicable to the Company.

Liquidity Management 

Since the Company is a holding company and does not conduct regular banking operations, its primary sources of liquidity are dividends from the Bank. Under the California Financial Code, payment of a dividend from the Bank to the Company is restricted to the lesser of the Bank s retained earnings or the amount of the Bank s undistributed net profits from the previous three fiscal years. The primary uses of funds for the Company are stockholder dividends, investment in the Bank and ordinary operating expenses. Management anticipates that there will be sufficient earnings at the Bank level to provide dividends to the Company to meet its funding requirements for the next twelve months. 

Maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all times to meet the Company s cash flow requirements. Liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. Liquidity management involves the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss, and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost. For this purpose, the Company maintains a portion of funds in cash and cash equivalents, salable government guaranteed loans and securities available for sale. The Company obtains funds from the repayment and maturity of loans as well as deposit inflows, investment security maturities and paydowns, Federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, and other borrowings. The Company s primary use of funds are the origination of loans, the purchase of investment securities, withdrawals of deposits, maturity of certificate of deposits, repayment of borrowings and dividends to common stockholders. The Company s liquid assets as of September 30, 2024 were 445.1 million compared to 489.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company s liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was 23.4 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 26.5 as of December 31, 2023. Liquid assets decreased during the first nine months of 2024, mainly due to the increase in public deposits which requires AFS investment securities to be pledged as collateral, and thereby reducing the total unpledged securities that could be liquidated. Management anticipates that cash and cash equivalents on hand and other sources of funds will provide adequate liquidity for operating, investing and financing needs and regulatory liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Management monitors the Company s liquidity position daily, balancing loan funding/payments with changes in deposit activity and overnight investments. 

As a secondary source of liquidity, the Company relies on advances from the FHLB to supplement the supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the FHLB are typically secured by a portion of the loan portfolio. The FHLB determines limitations on the amount of advances by assigning a percentage to each eligible loan category that will count towards the borrowing capacity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s borrowing capacity from the FHLB was approximately 350.4 million and there were no outstanding advances. The Company also maintains a line of credit with two correspondent banks to purchase up to 70 million in federal funds, and approximately 32.8 million borrowing capacity through the FRB Discount Window, for which there were no advances on either borrowing source as of September 30, 2024. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

During the ordinary course of business, the Company provides various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of customers. These commitments, which represent a credit risk to us, are not represented in any form on the balance sheets. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had commitments to extend credit of 176.6 million and 186.3 million, respectively, which includes obligations under letters of credit of 4.2 million and 3.6 million, respectively. 

The effect on the Company s revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used.

Recent Regulatory Developments 

CFPB Open Banking Rule 

In October 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB finalized a rule to implement Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which would require certain entities, including the Company and the Bank, to, among other things, make available to a consumer, upon request, information in its control or possession concerning the consumer financial product or service that the consumer obtained from that entity. In issuing the rule, the CFPB said that the rule will move the U.S. closer to an open banking system and will let consumers more easily switch banks or other providers. In general, the rule also requires, among other things, data providers holding a consumer account, such as the Bank, to establish a developer interface satisfying certain data security specifications and other standards, through which the data provider can receive requests for, and provide, specific types of data covered by the rule in electronic, usable form to authorized third parties, including data aggregators. Under the rule, data providers are prohibited from, among other things, charging consumers or third parties fees for processing these consumer data requests. The rule also places certain data security, authorization and other obligations on third parties accessing covered data from data providers, which could include the Company and the Bank when acting in certain capacities. The rule requires third parties to limit their collection, use, and retention of the data received to only what is reasonably necessary to provide the consumers requested product or service. The compliance date for a depository institution data provider that holds at least 1.5 billion in total assets but less than 3 billion in total assets is April 1, 2029; however, the final rule is subject to ongoing litigation that could impact whether and when the Company and the Bank are required to comply with the rule. We continue to evaluate the final rule and the potential impacts on the Company and the Bank.

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by management in the reports that the Company files or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by management in the reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There were no significant changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the Evaluation Date.
