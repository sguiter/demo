Spin-Off 

Healthier
Choices Management Corp. HCMC or the Parent announced on August 22, 2022 that its Board of Directors
approved the separation of the grocery business, including wellness business, into an independent, publicly traded company (the
 Spin-Off or Separation ). Prior to the Spin-Off, HCWC was a subsidiary under HCMC, which operated the
Ada s Natural Market, Paradise Health Nutrition, Mother Earth s Storehouse, Greens Natural Foods, Ellwood
Thompson s, and GreenAcres Market retail brands, as well as licensed wellness centers and Healthy U Wholesale. 

On
September 13, 2024 (the Spin-Off Date ), after the New York Stock Exchange American NYSEAM market closing,
the Spin-Off of the HCWC business was completed. On September 14, 2024, HCWC became an independent, publicly traded company, and on September
16, 2024, the stock commenced trading on the NYSEAM under the stock symbol HCWC. 

HCMC
distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock held by it on a pro rata basis to holders of HCMC s common stock. For each
 shares of HCMC common stock held as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 9, 2024, the record date for the Spin-Off
(the Record Date ), a HCMC stockholder was entitled to receive one (1) share of Class A common stock and three (3) shares
of Class B common stock. The Distribution was made in book-entry form by a distribution agent as soon as practicable after the date of
the Distribution. 

HCMC has secured binding commitments of million
in equity financing for HCWC from the same group of investors that invested million in HCMC Series E Preferred Stock. Pursuant
to the Securities Purchase Agreement for the HCMC Series E Stock HCMC Series E SPA ), the purchasers of HCMC Series E Stock
will also be required to purchase Series A Preferred Stock of HCWC in the same subscription amounts that the Purchasers paid for the HCMC
Series E Stock (regardless of whether or not such HCMC Series E Stock has been converted into HCMC common stock). 

million and negative working capital of million.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred net losses of approximately million and cash used in operating
activities of approximately million. The Company s liquidity needs through September 30, 2024 have been satisfied through
initial public offering and financing agreement with private lenders. 

Management has made plans to reduce certain costs and raise needed capital,
however there can be no assurance the Company can successfully implement these plans. The Company contracted a third-party consultant,
whose expertise is streamlining operations, to identify areas of improvement and cost savings. The Company will enact the consultant s
recommendation in anticipation of realizing savings and achieving profitability. The Company plans on evaluating non-performing stores
and continuing to expand via acquisition which will help achieve profitability. Also, the Company is formulating plans to raise capital
from outside investors and from equity offerings, as it has done in the past, to fund operating losses and also provide capital for further
business acquisitions. 

On July 18, 2024, HCWC entered into a million
loan and security agreement with a private lender to support its expansion plans and funding of any working capital needs, of which 
million was used for the July 18, 2024 purchase of GreenAcres Market. The face amount of the loan is with annual interest
and has a maturity date of . On July 24, 2024, the Company finalized the closing of Saugerties building sale with all parties
involved and received net proceeds of . 

On
August 18, 2022, HCMC entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement HCMC Preferred Stock pursuant to which the HCMC
sold and issued 
shares of its Series E Convertible Preferred Stock to institutional investors for 
per share or an aggregate subscription of 
million. This same group of investors committed to invest 
million in HCWC after the Spin-Off and IPO transactions were completed. As such, HCWC entered into an agreement to sell shares of its Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock ), with the gross proceeds from such offering expected to be million. The institutional
investors that acquired HCMC Series E Preferred Stock are contractually required to purchase the Series A Preferred Stock in the same
dollar amounts as they invested in the HCMC Series E Preferred Stock (regardless of whether or not such HCMC Series E Preferred Stock
has been converted into HCMC common stock). 

The
Company believes its cash on hand and the commitment of million raised through its security offering noted above will enable the
Company to meet its obligations and capital requirements for at least the twelve months from the date these financial statements are
issued. Accordingly, no adjustment has been made to the financial statements to account for this uncertainty. 

and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash
equivalents. The majority of the Company s cash is concentrated in one financial institution, which is in excess of Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company did not have any cash
equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The
majority of arrangements with customers contain one performance obligation: to provide a distinct set of products or services. Most performance
obligations are satisfied simultaneously as the Company exchanges products or services for customer payment. Exceptions include gift
cards and loyalty rewards, for which the Company has a performance obligation to deliver products or services at a future date. As gift
cards are purchased and loyalty points earned, contract liabilities are recorded until the performance obligations are satisfied through
delivery of products or services or breakage based on gift card and loyalty reward program term limits. 

The
Company s breakage policy is twenty-four months for gift cards and twelve months for loyalty rewards. Loyalty rewards are earned
at five percent on qualifying purchases and the reward functions as an allocation of transaction price from the period earned by the
customer to the period the performance obligation is satisfied by the Company. As such, all contract liabilities are expected to be recognized
within a twenty-four-month period.

Basic
earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted earnings

of stock awards. There is no dilution for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

On
September 16, 2024, the Company separated from HCMC. As referenced in Note 1. Organization, the Separation resulted in the initial issuance
of approximately million shares of HCWC common stock. For purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per common share for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the number of HCWC common shares issued upon separation and distribution was used to
reflect the outstanding shares. For purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended

Sourcing
and Vendors 

We
source from approximately 1,000 suppliers and offer well-over 4,000 brands. These suppliers range from small independent businesses to
multi-national conglomerates. We purchased approximately and of the goods we sell from our top 20 suppliers for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, approximately and of our total purchases were from UNFI for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We purchased approximately and of the goods we sell from our top 20 suppliers
for the nine month ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, approximately and of our total purchases were from UNFI for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We maintain good relations with all our suppliers and believe we have
adequate alternative supply methods, including self-distribution. 

As
mentioned, UNFI is our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products. Our customer distribution agreement with UNFI commenced
September 1, 2022, and has an initial term through September 1, 2027. Either party may terminate the agreement for defaults by the other
party of certain provisions of the agreement. We are obligated to purchase a minimum annual volume of products from UNFI, except in certain
defined circumstances when such purchasing obligation is excused. Pricing under our agreement with UNFI is on a cost plus 
basis. We believe UNFI has sufficient warehouse capacity and distribution technology to service our existing stores distribution
needs for natural foods and products. 

We
have longstanding relationships with our suppliers, and we require disclosure from them regarding quality, freshness, potency and safety
data information. Our bulk food private label products are packaged by us in pre-packed sealed bags to help prevent contamination while
in transit and in our stores. Unlike most of our competitors, most of our private label nuts, trail mix, and flours are refrigerated
in our warehouse and stores to maintain freshness.

The Company s credit loss is attributable to accounts receivable, and the Company determines the required allowance
for expected credit losses using information such as customer credit history, payment history, and financial condition. Amounts are recorded
to the allowance when it is determined that expected credit losses may occur. The Company reserved approximately and credit

Factors
Affecting Our Performance 

We
believe the following factors affect our performance: 

Retail :
We believe the operating performance of our retail stores will affect our revenue and financial performance. The Company has four natural
and organic groceries and dietary supplement stores located in Florida, nine stores located in New York and New Jersey, one store located in Virginia, three stores in Kansas, and two stores in Oklahoma. 

Increased
Competition : Food retail is a large and competitive industry. Our competition varies and includes national, regional, and local
conventional supermarkets, national superstores, alternative food retailers, natural foods stores, smaller specialty stores, and farmers 
markets. In addition, we compete with restaurants and other dining options in the food-at-home and food-away-from-home markets. The opening
and closing of competitive stores, as well as restaurants and other dining options, in regions where we operate will affect our results.
In addition, changing consumer preferences with respect to food choices and to dining out or at home can impact us. We also expect increased
product supply and downward pressure on prices to continue and impact our operating results in the future.

At

has not experienced any losses on its cash. The following table presents the Company s cash position as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to exercise
considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, our recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of commitments and
contingencies at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

We
base our estimates on our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry, current and expected economic conditions, the
attributes of our products, the regulatory environment, and in certain cases, the results of outside appraisals. We periodically re-evaluate
our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications
are necessary. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

The
following discussion and analysis contain a non-GAAP financial measure. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure
of a company s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included
or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as alternative to, net income,
operating income, and cash flow from operating activities, liquidity, or any other financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may
not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company, nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future financial
results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated
in accordance with GAAP. 

29 

Management
believes stockholders benefit from referring to the Adjusted EBITDA in planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. Management
uses this non-GAAP financial measure in evaluating its financial and operational decision making and as a means of evaluating period
to period comparison. 

EBITDA,
or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is an alternate measure of profitability to net income. Management
believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of our operating performance because it allows management, investors and analysts to
evaluate and assess our core operating results from period to period after removing the impact of significant non-cash and non-recurring
charges that effect comparability between reporting periods. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted for non-cash charges for
depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill, change in contingent consideration, also adjusted for non-recurring other expense
(income), and interest income. Our management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items. 

We
have included a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measure to net loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing
the non-GAAP financial measure, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps investors make comparisons between the Company and other
companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to
evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to specific definitions being used and to the reconciliation
between such measures and the corresponding GAAP measures provided by each company under applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

While
we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we
cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment,
actual results could differ from such estimates. 

30 

There
have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting
policies and estimates described in the 2023 Annual Report, which we believe are the most critical to our business and the understanding
of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

Seasonality 

We
do not consider our business to be seasonal. 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
report includes forward-looking statements including statements regarding retail expansion, the future demand for our products, competition, the adequacy of our cash resources and our authorized Common Stock, and our continued ability
to raise capital. 

The
words believe, may, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, 
 should, plan, could, target, potential, is likely, 
 will, expect and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. 

The
results anticipated by any or all of these forward-looking statements might not occur. Important factors that could cause actual results
to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include our future common stock price, customer acceptance of our products, and proposed federal and state regulation. We undertake no obligation
to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as the result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not
applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We
are required to report under Section 404(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, did not carry out an evaluation on internal controls
as of September 30, 2024 in regard to the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. As an evaluation was not carried out, our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered
by this report. 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal control over financial reporting based on
the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (2013 framework). Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of September 30, 2024 and noted the material weaknesses
as follows: 

Failure
 to have properly documented and designed disclosure controls and procedures and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal
 control over financial reporting. 

31 

Failure
 to perform periodic and year-end inventory observations in a timely manner and adequate controls to sufficiently perform required
 rollback procedures of inventory counts to the year-end. 

Weakness
 around purchase orders and inventory procedures, inclusive of year-end physical inventory observation procedures as well as physical
 count procedures. 

Segregation
 of duties due to lack of personnel. 

Failure
 to follow accounts payable policies and procedures for vendor information updates. 

The
 Company had ineffective design, implementation and, operation of controls over logical access, program change management, and vendor
 management controls. The Company controls on IT should have included the following: 

Appropriate
 restrictions that would adequately prevent users from gaining inappropriate access to the financially relevant systems. 

IT
 program and data changes affecting the Company s financial IT applications and underlying accounting records, should be identified,
 tested, authorized and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT system(s) were complete and accurate. 

Obtaining
 and reviewing key third party service provider SOC reports. 

Our
management concluded that considering internal control deficiencies that, in the aggregate, rise to the level of material weaknesses,
we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on the criteria set forth in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

Planned
Remediation 

Management
continues to work to improve its controls related to our material weaknesses listed above. In order to achieve the timely implementation
of the above, management has commenced the following actions and will continue to assess additional opportunities for remediation on
an ongoing basis: 

Continuing
 to increase headcount across the Company, with a particular focus on hiring individuals with strong internal control backgrounds
 and inventory expertise. 

Increasing
 its focus on the Company s purchase order process in order to better manage inventory thereby improving cash management. Utilizing
 margin analysis to control inventory and purchase, and ultimately leading to more reliable and precise financial reporting. 

Establishing
 policies and procedures in the IT area to mitigate data breach, unauthorized access and address segregation of duties, as well as
 review key third party service provider SOC reports. 

Using
 business intelligence to combine business analytics, data tools and infrastructure to help the Company quickly identify the issues
 in POS system and facilitate internal control over financial reporting. Developing dashboards for operation to monitor the margin
 at store level, department level and Stock Keeping Unit Sku level. 

Establishing
 procedures and enforcing monthly and quarterly perishable physical inventory count for all retail stores and analyzing the financial
 impacts to improve efficiency in inventory control and purchase control. 

Analyzing
 stores operation by implementing monthly financial statements review with management and store managers. Utilizing the breakeven
 analysis to better facilitate operation decision. 

Providing
 sufficient training to accounts payable associates and enforcing accounts payable policies and procedures. 

We
are currently working to improve and simplify our internal processes and implement enhanced controls, as discussed above, to address
the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and to remedy the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures. These material weaknesses will not be considered to be remediated until the applicable remediated controls are operating
for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financing Reporting 

Following
the Spin-Off, new corporate and governance functions, such as finance, tax and treasury, have been implemented in order to meet all regulatory
requirements for a standalone public company. Further, the former parent will continue to provide various services and functions under
the terms of the transition services agreement, many of which use a shared technology platform, including human resources, payroll and
certain logistics functions. . Except as detailed above, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes
in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act that have
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

On
July 31, 2024, one of the Company s subsidiaries, Healthy Choice Markets IV, LLC, was served with a lawsuit filed by a former employee
alleging violations of state and federal wage and hour laws. The Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously
defend against the lawsuit. While the outcome of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that
the lawsuit, if adversely resolved, would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

From
time to time the Company is involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that there is no
other litigation pending that is likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations as of September 30, 2024. With respect to legal costs, we record such costs as incurred.
