Executive Summary 
 Through the first six months of the fiscal year, sales and other operating revenues increased 99.8 million , or 9.1 , to 1,201.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,101.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 . This increase was due to a 15.6 increase in average sales prices driven by higher tobacco prices, despite a 7.9 decrease in kilo volumes sold. Gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from 14.7 for the six months ended September 30, 2023 to 13.3 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 due mainly to regional mix from the El Ni o weather effects on Africa and South America. 
 
 The ongoing Red Sea conflict, Typhoon Yagi in Southeast Asia in September 2024, and monsoon rains in India and Bangladesh during August and September 2024 contributed to shipping constraints, including vessel and equipment availability, port congestion, and rising freight costs, and undersupply conditions throughout the first half of the fiscal year. 
 
 We completed our crop purchases in the southern hemisphere and commenced crop purchases in certain markets in the northern hemisphere during the second quarter. We continued to experience elevated prices for green tobacco from continued undersupply conditions and inflation. As of September 30, 2024 , our inventory was 974.6 million and our uncommitted inventory was 16.7 million. Despite purchasing more expensive green tobacco, our disciplined focus on reducing long-term debt has resulted in a total reduction of 142.8 million of aggregate principal amount of long-term debt since March 2024.

Sales and other operating revenues were 624.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 566.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 58.0 million, or 9.3 . This was due to a 23.0 decrease in kilo volumes sold primarily due to the accelerated timing of shipments from North America in the three months ended June 30, 2024 and delayed shipments from Africa in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior-year period, partially offset by a 14.5 increase in average sales prices over this period, driven by higher tobacco prices. 
 
 Cost of goods and services sold were 535.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 490.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , a decrease of 44.6 million, or 8.3 . This was mainly due to the decrease in kilo volumes sold , partially offset by a 14.5 increase in average cost per kilo primarily due to undersupply conditions and inflation. 
 
 Gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from 14.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 13.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due mainly to product and regional mix. Average gross profit per kilo increased 14.3 , primarily due t o more favorable customer mix. 
 
 Gain on debt retirement of 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the repurchase of 34.2 million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes for 26.3 million, a 23.0 discount to par, during the current quarter. See " Note 11. Debt Arrangements " to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. 
 
 Interest expense was 33.0 million for three months ended September 30, 2023 and 35.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.7 million, or 8.2 . This increase was driven by higher borrowings on our foreign seasonal lines of credit that were primarily used to purchase more expensive green tobacco, particularly from Africa , and increased variable interest rates. This increase was partially offset by partial repurchases of the 2027 Notes in March, April, and August 2024, as well as the partial repurchase of the Pyxus Term Loans in May 2024.

Sales and other operating revenues were 1,101.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and 1,201.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 99.8 million, or 9.1 . This was due to a 15.6 increase in average sales prices over this period, driven by higher tobacco prices, partially offset by 7.9 decrease in kilo volumes sold. 
 
 Cost of goods and services sold were 939.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and 1,041.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 102.4 million, or 10.9 . This was mainly due to a 16.4 increase in average cost per kilo, primarily due to undersupply conditions and inflation, partially offset by the decrease in kilo volumes sold . 
 
 Gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from 14.7 for the six months ended September 30, 2023 to 13.3 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, due mainly to regional mix. Average gross profit per kilo increased 10.8 , primari ly due to a more favorable customer mix. 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 74.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and 79.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.4 million, or 7.3 . This increase wa s primarily due to the recognition of 3.6 million for equity-based compensation pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2020 Incentive Plan, and a higher accrual for bonus compensation. See " Note 17. Equity -Based Compensation " to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. 
 
 Gain on debt retirement of 8.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the repurchase of 10.3 million of aggregate principal amount of the Pyxus Term Loans for 9.4 million, a 12.0 discount to par, and the repurchase of 34.2 million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes for 26.3 million, a 23.0 discount to par. See " Note 11. Debt Arrangements " to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. 
 
 Interest expense, net was 63.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and 69.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.2 million, or 8.2 . This increase was due to higher borrowings on our foreign seasonal lines of credit that were primarily used to purchase more expensive green tobacco, particularly from South America and Africa , and increased variable interest rates. This increase was partially offset by partial repurchases of the 2027 Notes in March, April, and August 2024, as well as the partial repurchase of the Pyxus Term Loans in May 2024. 
 
 Income tax expense was 10.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 and 14.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.0 million, or 39.2 . This increase was primarily due to tax benefits in the prior period from foreign currency losses and foreign unremitted earnings, partially offset by improvements in the current period valuation allowances and uncertain tax benefits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings under our foreign seasonal lines of credit, availability under our ABL Credit Facility, and cash collections from our securitized receivables. Our liquidity requirements are affected by various factors from our core tobacco leaf business, including crop seasonality, foreign currency and interest rates, green tobacco prices, customer mix, crop size, and quality. Our leaf tobacco business is seasonal, and purchasing, processing, and selling activities have several associated peaks where cash on-hand and outstanding indebtedness may vary significantly compared to year end. The first three quarters of our fiscal year generally represent the peak of our working capital requirements. 
 
 Although we believe that our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs for the next twelve months, we anticipate periods during which our liquidity needs for operations will approach the levels of our anticipated available cash and permitted borrowings under our credit facilities. Unanticipated developments affecting our liquidity needs, including with respect to the foregoing factors, and sources of liquidity, including impacts affecting our cash flows from operations and the availability of capital resources (including an inability to renew or refinance seasonal lines of credit), may result in a deficiency in liquidity. To address a potential liquidity deficiency, we may undertake plans to minimize cash outflows, which could include exiting operations that do not generate positive cash flow. 

Debt Financing 
 We continue to finance our business with a combination of short-term and long-term credit lines, the long-term debt securities, advances from customers, and cash from operations when available. See " Note 11. Debt Arrangements " to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for a summary of our short-term and long-term debt. 
 
 We continuously monitor and, as available, adjust funding sources as needed to enhance and drive various business opportunities. From time to time we may take steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position. Such actions could include prepayments, open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other redemptions or retirements of outstanding debt, and refinancing of debt. The amount of prepayments or the amount of debt that may be repurchased, refinanced, or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants, and other considerations. 
 
 The following summarizes our total borrowing capacity at September 30, 2024 and 2023 under our short-term and long-term credit lines and letter of credit facilities and the remaining available amount after the reduction for outstanding borrowings and amounts reserved for outstanding letters of credit: 
 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in millions) Total Borrowing Capacity Remaining Amount Available Total Borrowing Capacity Remaining Amount Available Senior Secured Credit Facilities: ABL Credit Facility 120.0 85.0 100.0 100.0 Foreign seasonal lines of credit 885.2 175.4 652.8 130.2 Other long-term debt 0.4 0.3 0.6 0.2 Letters of credit 10.8 3.0 10.5 3.7 Total 1,016.4 263.7 763.9 234.1 
 
 The total borrowing capacity under the ABL Credit Facility increased 20.0 million when compared to the prior period as a result of the Company entering into the Third Amendment to the ABL Credit Agreement on October 24, 2023, which among other things, increased the aggregate amount of revolving loan commitments from 100.0 million to 120.0 million. The amounts presented as available under the ABL Credit Facility are subject to further limitations from the borrowing base consisting of certain eligible accounts receivable and inventory, reduced by specified reserves. 
 
 The total borrowing capacity of our foreign seasonal lines of credit increased 232.4 million when compared to the prior year and were primarily utilized to purchase green tobacco at higher prices. The amounts presented as available for certain of the foreign seasonal lines of credit are subject to further limitations by receivables and inventories as collateral and restrictive covenants. 
 
 29 

Net Debt 
 We refer to "Net debt," a non-GAAP measure, as total debt liabilities less cash and cash equivalents. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to monitor leverage and to evaluate changes to the Company's capital structure. A limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and cash equivalents, and therefore, may imply that management intends to use cash and cash equivalents to reduce outstanding debt and that cash held in certain jurisdictions can be applied to repay obligations owing in other jurisdictions and without reduction for applicable taxes. In addition, net debt suggests that our debt obligations are less than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. The following summarizes the computation of net debt: 
 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 March 31, 2024 Notes payable 744.8 570.0 499.3 Current portion of long-term debt 0.1 20.2 20.3 Long-term debt (1) 
 489.5 574.0 497.7 Total debt liabilities 1,234.3 1,164.2 1,017.3 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 123.5 112.1 92.6 Net debt 1,110.9 1,052.1 924.7 Amounts may not equal column totals due to rounding 
 (1) Fluctuations in long-term debt include borrowings and repayments on the outstanding indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility, along with repurchases of certain long-term debt. Weighted average borrowings outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility were 37.3 million and 50.6 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Net debt increased as of September 30, 2024 when compared to September 30, 2023 from higher borrowings on our foreign seasonal lines of credit that were primarily used to purchase more expensive green tobacco, particularly from South America and Africa.

 (in millions except for current ratio) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 March 31, 2024 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 130.9 117.7 99.8 Trade and other receivables, net 237.5 261.3 187.5 Inventories and advances to tobacco suppliers, net 1,052.6 944.8 952.1 Recoverable income taxes 3.0 5.1 4.5 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 62.1 52.0 66.4 Total current assets 1,486.1 1,380.9 1,310.2 Notes payable 744.8 570.0 499.3 Accounts payable 152.6 153.2 181.2 Advances from customers 75.8 46.1 90.7 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 103.4 94.0 97.0 Income taxes payable 13.6 12.6 8.5 Operating leases payable 8.3 8.4 8.1 Current portion of long-term debt 0.1 20.2 20.3 Total current liabilities 1,098.5 904.4 905.2 Current ratio 1.4 to 1 1.5 to 1 1.4 to 1 Working capital 387.6 476.5 405.0 Amounts may not equal column totals due to rounding 
 
 Working capital declined from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 by 88.9 million, or 18.7 , due to higher borrowings on our foreign seasonal lines of credit that were primarily used to purchase more expensive green tobacco, particularly from South America and Africa, and increased variable interest rates.

Inventories 
 The following summarizes inventory committed to a customer and uncommitted inventory balances for processed tobacco: 
 
 (in millions) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 March 31, 2024 Committed 733.9 622.1 570.4 Uncommitted 16.7 24.7 14.9 Total processed tobacco 750.6 646.8 585.3 
 
 Total processed tobacco increased from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 by 103.8 million, or 16.0 , due to the higher costs of procuring and processing tobacco, along with delayed shipments out of Africa. Uncommitted levels of processed tobacco remain low as undersupply conditions persist in the global tobacco market. Challenging weather events in multiple geographies and shipping constraints, such as container availability and longer transit routes, have contributed to the continued undersupply conditions. See " Note 7. Inventories, Net " to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. 

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 We typically finance our non-U.S. tobacco operations with uncommitted short-term foreign seasonal lines of credit, normally extending for a term of 180 to 365 days, corresponding to the tobacco crop cycle in that market. These short-term foreign seasonal lines of credit are typically uncommitted and provide lenders the right to cease making loans and demand repayment of loans. These short-term foreign seasonal lines of credit are generally renewed at the outset of each tobacco season. We maintain various other financing arrangements to meet the cash requirements of our businesses. See " Note 11. Debt Arrangements " to the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. 
 
 We utilize capital in excess of cash flow from operations to finance accounts receivable, inventory, and advances to tobacco suppliers in foreign countries. In addition, we may periodically elect to purchase, redeem, repay, retire, or cancel indebtedness prior to stated maturity under our various foreign credit lines. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was 130.9 million, of which approximately 76.5 million was held in non-U.S. jurisdictions for non-U.S. working capital needs, a majority of which is subject to exchange controls and certain of which is subject to tax consequences, which could limit our ability to fully repatriate these funds. Fluctuation of the U.S. dollar versus many of the currencies in which we have costs may have an impact on our working capital requirements. We will continue to monitor and hedge foreign currency costs, as needed.

The following summarizes the sources and uses of our cash flows: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net income 1.7 8.7 Trade and other receivables (150.6) (143.2) Inventories and advances to tobacco suppliers (100.7) (128.6) Payables and accrued expenses (20.3) (10.3) Advances from customers (14.1) 3.6 Other 3.7 14.4 Net cash used in operating activities (280.3) (255.4) Collections from beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables 101.6 79.3 Other (8.1) (6.2) Net cash provided by investing activities 93.5 73.1 Net proceeds from short-term borrowings 244.2 192.2 Repayment of long-term borrowings (55.8) Net proceeds (repayment) of revolving loan facilities 35.0 (25.0) Other (3.4) (3.9) Net cash provided by financing activities 220.0 163.3 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (2.1) (2.2) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 31.1 (21.2) 
 
 The change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 increased by 52.3 million. This increase was mainly driven by higher borrowings on our foreign seasonal lines of credit that were primarily used to purchase more expensive green tobacco, particularly from South America and Africa, and the ABL Credit Facility, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt. 

Planned Capital Expenditures 
 Capital investments in our leaf operations were primarily for routine replacement of machinery and equipment, as well as investments in assets that will add value for our customers and increase our efficiency. We incurred approximately 9.8 million in capital expenditures for the six months ended September 30, 2024 , and are expecting to incur an additional 20.5 million for the remainder of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, which includes expenditures expected to be funded through government assistance. 

Pension and Postretirement Health and Life Insurance Benefits 
 The following summarizes cash contributions to pension and postretirement health and life insurance benefits: 
 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 Contributions made during the period 2.3 Contributions expected for the remainder of the fiscal year 2.6 Total 4.9

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to inherent limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance (not absolute) that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 There were no changes that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

This program expires on August 15, 2027. The number, price, structure and timing of share repurchases will be at the Company's sole discretion, and future repurchases of our common stock are dependent on market conditions, liquidity needs, and certain restrictions under our debt arrangements, among other factors.
