 of the outstanding shares of ZimVie common stock, and all transactions between ZimVie and Zimmer Biomet from the distribution to February 1, 2023 were reported as related party transactions. As of February 1, 2023, Zimmer Biomet had sold all of its ownership in ZimVie and is no longer considered a related party. As such, transactions with Zimmer Biomet subsequent to February 1, 2023 are reported as third party transactions. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("Annual Report") for further description of the impact of the distribution and post-spin activities with Zimmer Biomet. On December 15, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our spine segment to an affiliate of H.I.G. Capital (the "Buyer") for million in total consideration, comprised of million in cash, subject to certain customary adjustments as set forth in the agreement, and million in the form of a promissory note that accrues interest at a rate of per annum, compounded semi-annually, and interest is payable in kind. On April 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our spine segment for a total purchase price of million (inclusive of million in preliminary closing adjustments), subject to certain customary adjustments as set forth in the agreement, and received proceeds of million, excluding the promissory note and transaction costs , but including cash disposed of million . See Notes 2 and 7 for additional discussion. operating segments, 1) the dental products segment, and 2) the spine products segment. Since the sale of our spine segment, our core services include designing, manufacturing and distributing dental implant systems. Dental reconstructive implants are for individuals who are totally without teeth or are missing one or more teeth, dental prosthetic products are aimed at providing a more natural restoration to resemble the original teeth, and dental regenerative products are for soft tissue and bone rehabilitation. Our key products include the T3 Implant, Tapered Screw-Vent Implant System, Trabecular Metal Dental Implant, BellaTek Encode Impression System and Puros Allograft Particulate. Prior to the sale of our spine segment, the core services of our spine segment included designing, manufacturing and distributing medical devices and surgical instruments to deliver comprehensive solutions for individuals with back or neck pain caused by degenerative conditions, deformities or traumatic injury of the spine. We also provided devices that promote bone healing. Other differentiated products in our spine portfolio included Mobi-C Cervical Disc, a motion-preserving alternative to fusion for patients with cervical disc disease, and The Tether , a novel non-fusion device for treatment of pediatric scoliosis.

million in restricted cash. The restriction as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is on cash held in China as a result of ongoing litigation with a spine products distributor in China related to our decision to exit our spine products business in China. Sale of Spine Segment The historical results of our spine segment have been reflected as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements as the sale represented a strategic shift in our business that had a major effect on operations and financial results. The assets and liabilities associated with this segment are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The disclosures presented in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements are presented on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted.

million (inclusive of million in preliminary closing adjustments), subject to certain customary adjustments as set forth in the agreement, and received proceeds of million, excluding the promissory note and transaction costs, but including cash disposed of million. We recognized a gain on the sale of million, which is included in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations and primarily related to transaction costs incurred related to the sale. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, the closing adjustments were finalized with the Buyer in October 2024, resulting in an immaterial adjustment to the purchase price. The transfer of spine business activities in certain jurisdictions ("Deferred Transfer Locations") is deferred until the Buyer has met various legal and regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions. Until such transfer, we continue to control and operate these Deferred Transfer Locations and therefore we continue to consolidate the assets and liabilities and results of operations within discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. Details of the assets and liabilities and results of operations not transferred to the Buyer as of September 30, 2024 are included below. Net profit or loss of the Deferred Transfer Locations are transferred to the Buyer on a monthly basis. The net profit or loss to be transferred to the Buyer is included in Other expense, net within discontinued operations. We currently expect the Deferred Transfer Locations to be transferred within one year of the closing date of the sale. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, one Deferred Transfer Location with an immaterial net asset balance was transferred to the Buyer, and two additional Deferred Transfer Locations with immaterial net asset balances were transferred to the Buyer in October 2024. In conjunction with the sale of our spine segment, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement ("TSA") to provide certain support services for up to 12 months from the closing date of the sale. These services include, among others, accounting, information technology, human resources, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and customer support. Income recognized related to the TSA is recorded as Other income in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Due to the conversion, ZimVie incurred million of incremental share-based compensation expense. Of this amount, million was related to unvested and/or unexercised share-based awards and was recognized at the distribution date. The remaining million is being recognized over the remainder of the share-based awards' weighted average vesting period of years from the date of the distribution.

million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the 2022 Plan. Shares issued pursuant to converted Zimmer Biomet share-based awards do not count against this limit. At September 30, 2024, million shares were available for future grants and awards under the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan provides for the grant of various types of awards including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units, restricted stock and RSUs. Generally, awards have a vesting period and stock options have a term of . Vesting may accelerate upon retirement after the first anniversary date of the award if certain criteria are met. Additionally, in cases of special circumstances as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate vesting. We recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, less awards expected to be forfeited using estimated forfeiture rates. Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, except in limited circumstances where local law may dictate otherwise.

We used a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. For awards granted shortly after the distribution: expected volatility of was derived from a peer group's combined historical volatility that was de-levered and re-levered for ZimVie as ZimVie did not have sufficient historical volatility based on the expected term of the underlying options; the expected term of the stock options of years was determined using the simplified method; and the risk-free interest rate of was determined using the implied yield then available for zero-coupon United States ("U.S.") government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options. The dividend yield was as ZimVie has no plans to pay a dividend for the foreseeable future. Aggregate intrinsic value was negligible at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to unvested stock options of million , which is expected to be amortized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of less than .

R SUs with performance-based vesting provisions ("PRSUs") declined to at September 30, 2024. In September 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a modification of all outstanding PRSUs. Prior to the modification, the PRSUs could have vested from - of target based on the level of cumulative achievement of pre-defined performance metrics based on the consolidated results of the dental and spine segments. The PRSUs were payable in common shares and did not have the right to vote until settled. Compensation expense related to the PRSUs was being recognized over a cliff vesting period, and adjusted as needed for changes in the projected level of achievement of the performance metrics. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Compensation Committee approved a conversion of all outstanding PRSUs into time-based RSUs on a one-for-one basis. The converted awards will cliff-vest on the award's original vesting date. For PRSUs outstanding prior to the conversion that were expected to vest, we determined that there was no change in their fair value immediately after the conversion. For PRSUs outstanding prior to the conversion that were not expected to vest, the fair value of the awards immediately after the conversion increased due to becoming probable of vesting, resulting in million of incremental compensation expense that will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of approximately years.

The total fair value of RSUs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million , respectively. The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively.

Including consideration of paid-in-kind interest, the fair value of the note was million as of September 30, 2024, which was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, where contractual cash flows were discounted to present value at a risk-adjusted rate of return. The fair value of the note is determined each period by applying the same approach, considering changes to the risk-adjusted rate of return given observed changes to the interest rate environment, market pricing of credit risk and issuer-specific credit risk. The fair values of acquisition-related contingent payments are estimated using Level 3 inputs. Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of sales-based payments and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. The fair value of sales-based payments is based upon probability-weighted future revenue estimates and increases as revenue estimates increase.

Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following information should be read in conjunction with the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report, particularly in Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Our History 
 
 ZimVie was incorporated in 2021 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Zimmer Biomet for the sole purpose of holding directly or indirectly the assets and liabilities associated with the dental and spine businesses of Zimmer Biomet for distribution. The distribution of the dental and spine businesses was completed on March 1, 2022, and resulted in ZimVie becoming a standalone, publicly traded company. Following the distribution, Zimmer Biomet initially retained 19.7 of the outstanding shares of ZimVie common stock, and all transactions between ZimVie and Zimmer Biomet from the distribution to February 1, 2023 were reported as related party transactions. As of February 1, 2023, Zimmer Biomet had sold all of its 19.7 ownership in ZimVie and is no longer considered a related party. As such, transactions with Zimmer Biomet subsequent to February 1, 2023 are reported as third party transactions. 
 
 Sale of Spine Segment 
 
 On December 15, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our spine segment to an affiliate of H.I.G. Capital. On April 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our spine segment for a total purchase price of 377.2 million (inclusive of 2.2 million in preliminary closing adjustments), subject to certain customary adjustments as set forth in the agreement, received proceeds of 311.8 million, excluding the promissory note and transaction costs, but including cash disposed of 26.1 million, and recorded a gain on the sale of 11.3 million. See additional information in Notes 1 and 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Our Company 
 
 ZimVie is a leading medical technology company dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for dental patients worldwide. Prior to the closing of the sale of our spine segment, our operations were principally managed on a products basis and included two operating segments, 1) the dental products segment, and 2) the spine products segment. Following the sale of our spine segment on April 1, 2024, we operate as a single segment. 
 
 Since the sale of our spine segment, our core services include designing, manufacturing and distributing dental implant systems. We develop, manufacture and market a comprehensive portfolio of products and solutions designed to support dental tooth replacement and restoration procedures. Dental reconstructive implants are for individuals who are totally without teeth or are missing one or more teeth, dental prosthetic products are aimed at providing a more natural restoration to resemble the original teeth, and dental regenerative products are for soft tissue and bone rehabilitation. 
 
 Prior to the sale of our spine segment, the core services of our spine segment included designing, manufacturing and distributing medical devices and surgical instruments to deliver comprehensive solutions for individuals with back or neck pain caused by degenerative conditions, deformities or traumatic injury of the spine. Our broad portfolio addressed all areas of spine with market leadership in cervical disc replacement and vertebral body tethering to treat pediatric scoliosis. We also provided devices that promote bone healing. 
 
 RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES 
 
 Below is a summary of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. For further information, refer to our discussion of expenses below under Results of Operations - Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 - Operating Expenses and in Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 2024 Program 
 
 In January 2024, we initiated restructuring activities to better structure the organization to support our dental segment following the disposal of the spine segment, as discussed in the "Overview - Sale of Spine Segment" above. 
 22 

2023 Programs 
 
 In April and July 2023, we initiated restructuring activities to better position our organization for future success based on the then-current business environment. These activities had the objective of reducing our global cost structure and streamlining our organizational infrastructure across all regions, functions and levels. These programs were substantially complete as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 2022 Program 
 
 In June 2022, we initiated a restructuring plan with the objective of reducing costs and optimizing our global footprint. This program was substantially complete as of June 30, 2024. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 As discussed above in the "Overview," we entered into a definitive agreement in December 2023 to sell our spine segment, which closed on April 1, 2024. As such, the historical results of our spine segment have been reflected as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, and the following discussion is presented on a continuing operations basis. See Notes 1 and 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for details of the financial condition, results of operations and selected cash flows of our spine segment.

Volume/Mix Trends 
 
 Volume decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods. Lower dental implant and capital equipment sales were partially offset by growth in digital dentistry and biomaterials sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period. Lower capital equipment and dental implant sales were partially offset by growth in digital dentistry and biomaterials sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period. 
 
 Pricing Trends 
 
 We experienced a price decline in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods, primarily related to pricing pressures on premium dental implant system sales in North America, resulting from a customer mix shift and customer consolidation in the specialty segment, as well as declines in pricing in China resulting from volume-based pricing. 
 
 23 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 
 In countries where we have a subsidiary, we sell to customers in their local currencies. Accordingly, our net sales as reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to net sales denominated in Euros and Japanese Yen. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, foreign exchange fluctuations had a small positive effect on year-over-year sales, mainly due to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative effect on year-over-year sales, mainly due to the weakening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar.

Cost of Products Sold and Intangible Asset Amortization 
 
 Cost of products sold in dollars declined in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods, primarily due to the decline in sales as discussed above. Cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the same prior year period, primarily as a result of a mix shift to higher margin products. Cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to the same prior year period primarily due to the negative impact of price declines on sales as discussed above in "Net Sales - Pricing Trends." 
 
 Intangible asset amortization decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods, primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2023. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Research and development ("R D") expenses increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods. The increases in the three-month period were primarily due to professional service fees related to new product development and launches 0.6 million), compensation expense 0.4 million) and supplies 0.3 million). The increases in the nine-month period were primarily due to professional service fees related to new product development and launches 0.4 million) and compensation expense 0.2 million). 
 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses increased in dollars and as a percentage of sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period. Increases in compensation expense 1.1 million), travel and entertainment expense 0.5 million) and marketing expense 0.5 million) were partially offset by decreases in professional services fees 1.1 million). 
 
 24 

SG A expenses decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period, generally due to savings from our announced restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. Specifically, the decline in SG A was primarily attributable to decreases in compensation and recruiting expense 1.7 million), professional services fees 1.4 million) and TSA expenses related to our separation from Zimmer Biomet 0.7 million). 
 
 Expenses resulting from restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives relate to various restructuring plans as discussed above. We recognized expense of 0.7 million and 1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to employee termination benefits. We recognized expense of 3.7 million and 3.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to employee termination benefits, as well as professional services fees. For more information regarding these expenses, see Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Acquisition, integration, divestiture and related expenses include costs incurred to prepare for and complete the separation from Zimmer Biomet (such as professional fees, transition services agreements, costs to stand up our corporate organization and infrastructure), changes in the fair value of contingent consideration for acquisitions closed prior to the separation date and transaction costs related to the disposal of our spine segment. Acquisition, integration, divestiture and related expenses decreased by 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same prior year period, due primarily to a fair value adjustment of the promissory note related to the sale of the spine segment 1.2 million) and decreases in separation-related expenses 0.5 million), partially offset by transaction costs related to the evaluation of strategic options for our portfolio, including costs incurred related to the disposal of the spine segment (see Notes 1 and 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report) 1.1 million). Acquisition, integration, divestiture and related expenses increased by 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year period, due primarily to transaction costs related to the evaluation of strategic options for our portfolio, including costs incurred related to the disposal of the spine segment (see Notes 1 and 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report) 5.3 million), partially offset by decreases in separation-related expenses 3.2 million). 
 
 Other Income (Expense), net, Interest Income, Interest Expense and Income Taxes 
 
 Our other income (expense), net, relates to TSA income, as well as the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s functional currency. We recognized 3.2 million and 6.6 million of TSA income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the sale of the spine segment. Income or expense related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities varies based upon the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 Interest income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the same prior year periods, due primarily to interest income from the promissory note received as partial consideration for the sale of the spine segment (see Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report). 
 
 Interest expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the same prior year periods, due primarily to a reduction in outstanding debt (see Note 8 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report), as well as a reduction in interest rates. 
 
 Our ETR on loss before income taxes was 18.4 and (3.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and (34.2 and (5.0 ), respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the income tax rate was lower than the 21.0 statutory rate due to our mix of earnings and losses across jurisdictions and losses not benefited as a result of valuation allowances. 
 
 Our ETR in future periods could also potentially be impacted by: changes in our mix of pre-tax earnings; changes in tax rates, tax laws or their interpretation; the outcome of various federal, state and foreign audits; and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. Currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 The following discussion represents the combined liquidity and capital resources of continuing and discontinued operations. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 68.1 million and 87.8 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 Cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities were (7.3) million and 15.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 used cash of 4.8 million primarily due to cash used by accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by cash provided by inventories and income taxes. Working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 used cash of 21.5 million due to cash used for income taxes, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and related party payables, partially offset by cash provided by inventories, accounts receivable, related party receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets. 
 
 Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities were 285.2 million and (12.4) million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the current year period, we received proceeds of 291.1 million, net of cash disposed, from the sale of the spine segment (as discussed in Notes 1 and 2). Reductions in additions to instruments and other property, plant and equipment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period were primarily due to the sale of the spine segment. 
 
 Cash flows used in financing activities were 295.4 million and 16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the current year period, we prepaid 275.0 million on the Term Loan using proceeds from the sale of our spine segment (as discussed in Notes 1 and 2) and made optional prepayments on the Term Loan of 15.0 million. In the prior year period, we made optional prepayments on the Term Loan of 17.5 million, which represented the aggregate amount of the mandatory scheduled principal payments due in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 For additional information regarding our current debt arrangements, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report. In addition, for information regarding our other material estimated future cash requirements under our contractual obligations and certain other commitments, see Material Cash Requirements in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report. There have been no material changes to such information except as set forth herein. 
 
 We believe that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated through operations and cash available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months. On April 1, 2024, we prepaid 275.0 million on the Term Loan using proceeds from the sale of our spine segment (as discussed in Notes 1 and 2), and we wrote off 0.9 million of debt issuance costs. As a result of this prepayment, we have no more scheduled quarterly amortization payments on the Term Loan, and the remaining balance is due at maturity on February 28, 2027. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods and require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting estimates are those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. There were no changes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the application of our critical accounting estimates as described in our Annual Report. 
 
 ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for information on how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, British Pounds, and Swiss Francs. We manage our foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions. These forward contracts are designed to reduce the foreign exchange impact monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies have on our financial results. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in other (expense) income, net. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months, where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuations in prices. As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes. A 10 price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our interest expense and related risks as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations are due to borrowings under our credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had 221.9 million of floating rate debt subject to the adjusted term secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR"). A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in SOFR to our floating rate debt would, among other things, decrease our annual pre-tax results of operations by 2.2 million. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments and accounts receivable. 
 
 We place our cash and cash equivalents with highly rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. Substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and dental practices in the healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country-specific variables. Our ability to collect accounts receivable in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems. Most notably, in Europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government. Since we sell products to public hospitals in those countries, we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints. To the extent the respective governments ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates, we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future. 
 
 While we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in Europe and around the world, there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate.

Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Lega l Proceedings. 
 
 We are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. We currently do not expect the outcome of these matters to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, the outcome of such matters is unpredictable, our assessment of them may change, and resolution of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 For additional information related to our contingencies, see Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in those risk factors. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Due to the completion of the sale of our spine segment on April 1, 2024, the risk factor in our Annual Report entitled The pending sale of our spine business (the Pending Transaction is subject to various risks, uncertainties and conditions and may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all. no longer applies. 
 
 The risk factor in our Annual Report entitled We may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that we expect to achieve from the Pending Transaction. is replaced in its entirety by the following: 
 
 We may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that we expect to achieve from the sale of our spine segment (the Transaction ). 
 
 We are using the net proceeds from the Transaction to repay debt and invest in our dental business. The anticipated operational, financial, strategic and other benefits from the Transaction may not be achieved and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The anticipated benefits are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect, and could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs, regulatory developments and the other risks described in these risk factors. 
 
 The risk factor in our Annual Report entitled If the Pending Transaction is completed, we will be a smaller, less diversified company than as we exist today. is replaced in its entirety by the following: 
 
 The Transaction has resulted in us being a smaller, less diversified company. 
 
 The Transaction has resulted in us being a smaller, less diversified company that is significantly more reliant on our remaining dental business. As a result, we may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The diversification of revenues, costs and cash flows has diminished as a result of the Transaction, such that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital, and effective tax rate may be subject to increased volatility and our ability to fund capital expenditures, investments and service debt may be diminished. As a result of the Transaction, we are incurring ongoing costs that were previously allocated to the spine segment. Those costs may exceed our estimates and could diminish the benefits we expect to realize from the Transaction. 
 Item 5. Other Information . 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in the SEC s rules).
