Act ). Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our plans, beliefs or current expectations and may be signified

While
we have made assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the assumptions that support our forward-looking statements are based upon information
that is currently available and is subject to change. All forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are qualified in their entirety
by the cautionary statement contained in this section. We do not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information.
It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included

Liquidity
and Capital Resources. Historically, we have funded our operations, acquisitions, exploration and development expenditures from cash
generated by operating activities, bank borrowings, sales of non-core properties and issuance of common stock. Our primary financial
resource is our base of oil and gas reserves. We have pledged our producing oil and gas properties to secure our credit facility. We
do not have any delivery commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of our oil and gas under any existing contract or agreement. 

Our
long-term strategy is on increasing profit margins while concentrating on obtaining reserves with low-cost operations by acquiring and
developing oil and gas properties with potential for long-lived production. We focus our efforts on the acquisition of royalty and working
interests in non-operated properties in areas with significant development potential. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 1,974,033 compared to working capital of 3,259,200 at March 31, 2024, a decrease of 1,285,167 for the
reasons set forth below.

Cash
Flow Provided by Operating Activities. Cash flow from operating activities is primarily derived from the production of our crude
oil and natural gas reserves and changes in the balances of non-cash accounts, receivables, payables or other non-energy property asset
account balances. Cash flow provided by our operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,006,405 in comparison
to 2,430,364 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of 423,959 in our cash flow operating activities consisted

accounts payable and accrued expenses; and, a decrease in our net income of 126,810. Variations in cash flow from operating activities

expenditures in operating activities consist primarily of drilling expenses, production expenses and engineering services. Our expenses
also consist of employee compensation, accounting, insurance and other general and administrative expenses that we have incurred in order
to address normal and necessary business activities of a public company in the crude oil and natural gas production industry. 

Cash
Flow Used in Investing Activities. Cash flow from investing activities is derived from changes in oil and gas property balances.
For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash of 2,066,957 used for additions to oil and gas properties compared to 1,544,299
for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash
Flow Provided by Financing Activities. Cash flow from financing activities is derived from our changes in long-term debt and in equity
account balances. Net cash flow used in our financing activities was 834,575 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to
cash flow provided by our financing activities of 536,644 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. During the six months ended September
30, 2024, we expended 209,000 to pay the special dividend and 703,216 to purchase 57,766 shares of our stock for the treasury account
and received 77,641 from the exercise of stock options. 

Accordingly,
net cash decreased 895,127, leaving cash and cash equivalents on hand of 1,578,357 as of September 30, 2024.

New
Participations in Fiscal 2025. The Company currently plans to participate in the drilling and completion of 30 horizontal wells at
an estimated cost of approximately 2,000,000 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. Twenty-six of these wells are in the Delaware
Basin located in the western portion of the Permian Basin in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico. The remaining 4 wells are in Reagan County,
Texas. 

In
April 2024, Mexco expended approximately 80,000 to participate in the drilling of five horizontal wells in the Bone Spring formation
of the Delaware Basin in Lea County, New Mexico. Subsequently, in October 2024, the Company expended approximately 127,000 to complete
these wells. 

During
the first six months of fiscal 2025, Mexco expended approximately 293,000 to drill and complete four horizontal wells in the Wolfcamp
Sand formation of the Delaware Basin in Lea County, New Mexico. 

In
October 2022, the Company made an approximately 2 equity investment commitment in a limited liability company amounting to 2,000,000
of which 1,200,000 has been funded as of September 30, 2024. The limited liability company is capitalized at approximately 100 million
to purchase mineral interests in the Utica and Marcellus areas in the state of Ohio. To date, this LLC has returned 137,076 or 11 of
the total investment. 

Completion
of Wells Drilled in Fiscal 2024. The Company expended approximately 300,000 for the completion of 19 horizontal wells in which the
Company participated during fiscal 2024. 

The
Company expended approximately 107,000 for the completion costs of two horizontal wells in the Bone Spring Sand formation of the Delaware
Basin in Lea County, New Mexico that the Company participated in drilling during fiscal 2024. Mexco s working interest in these
wells is .53 . In July 2024, these wells were completed with initial average production rates of 1,402 barrels of oil, 2,009 barrels
of water and 2,168,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 1,763 BOE per day. 

Five
horizontal wells in the Bone Spring Sand formation of the Delaware Basin in Lea County, New Mexico in which the Company participated
during fiscal 2024 were completed in April 2024 with initial average production rates of 732 barrels of oil, 1,481 barrels of water and
657,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 842 of oil equivalent per day. Mexco s working interest in these wells is approximately 1.16 . 

A
horizontal well in the Penn Shale formation of the Delaware Basin in Lea County, New Mexico was completed in May 2024 with the initial
production rate of 964 barrels of oil, 2,441 barrels of water and 626,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 1,068 of oil equivalent per day.
Mexco s working interest in this well is .165 . 

The
Company expended approximately 207,000 for the completion costs of four horizontial wells in the Bone Spring Sand formation of the Delaware
Basin in Lea County, New Mexico that the Company participated in drilling during fiscal 2024. Mexco s working interest in these
wells is .45 . Subsequently, in October 2024, these wells were completed with initial average production rates of 893 barrels of oil,
2,990 barrels of water and 1,161,000 cubic feet of gas per day, or 1,087 BOE per day. 

Acquisitions.
 In April 2024, the Company acquired royalty interests in 21 producing wells operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and Cimarex
Energy Company and located in Reeves County, Texas for a purchase price of 158,000. 

In
August 2024, the Company acquired royalty interests in 6 producing wells operated by Marathon Oil and located in Karnes County, Texas
for a purchase price of 50,000; royalty interests in 15 producing wells operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and located in Weld
County, Colorado for a purchase price of 118,000; and, royalty interests in approximately 250 producing wells operated by Samson Exploration,
EOG Resources and others in Laramie County, Wyoming and Adams and Weld Counties, Colorado for a purchase price of 483,000. All of these
acquisitions were effective September 1, 2024. 

In
September 2024, the Company acquired royalty interests in 20 producing wells operated by Marathon Oil and Murphy Exploration and located
in Karnes County, Texas for a purchase price of 90,000 and effective August 1, 2024. 

We
are participating in other projects and are reviewing projects in which we may participate. The cost of such projects would be funded,
to the extent possible, from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations. The remainder may be funded through borrowings on
the credit facility and, if appropriate, sales of non-core properties.

Crude
oil and natural gas prices generally remained volatile during the last year. The volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely
difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. For example, in the last twelve months, the NYMEX
West Texas Intermediate WTI posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of 61.73 per bbl in September 2024 to a
high of 86.77 per bbl in October 2023. The Henry Hub Spot Market Price Henry Hub for natural gas has ranged from a low
of 1.25 per MMBtu in March 2024 to a high of 3.34 per MMBtu in October 2023. 

On
September 30, 2024, the WTI posted price for crude oil was 64.15 and the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was 2.65 per MMBtu. See
Results of Operations below for realized prices. Pipeline capacity constraints and maintenance in the Permian Basin area has contributed
to a wider difference between the WaHa Hub and the Henry Hub and at times prices were negative. 

Contractual
Obligations. We have no off-balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. The
following table summarizes our future payments we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of September 30, 2024:

 this total obligation for the remainder of the lease, our majority shareholder will pay 10,175 less than 1 year and 18,354 1-3 years
 for his portion of the shared office space. 

Results
of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023. There was net income
of 317,198 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of 269,433 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This
was a result of an increase in oil and gas revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expense that is further explained below. 

Oil
and gas sales. Revenue from oil and gas sales was 1,695,853 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a 23 increase from 1,380,710
for the same period of fiscal 2024. This resulted from an increase in oil and gas production offset by a decrease in oil and gas prices.
The decrease in the natural gas price was, in part, due to temporary pipeline constraints on certain properties and at certain times,
prices were negative. The following table sets forth our oil and natural gas revenues, production quantities and average prices received
during the three months ended September 30:

Production
and exploration. Production costs were 413,405 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a 5 increase from 392,674 for the same period
of fiscal 2024. This is the result of an increase in production taxes and marketing charges as a result of the increase in oil revenues and an increase in lease operating expense on new wells in which we own a working interest. 

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was 584,288 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025,
a 53 increase from 382,180 for the same period of fiscal 2024, primarily due to a an increase in the full cost pool amortization base,
an increase in oil and gas production and a decrease in gas reserves partially offset by an increase in oil reserves. 

Page 15 

General
and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were 334,525 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, a 9 
increase from 305,543 for the same period of fiscal 2024. This was primarily due to an increase in accounting fees and contract
services. 

Income
taxes. Federal income tax for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 84,833. Federal income tax for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 was 61,179. State income tax was 26,920 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 102 increase from 13,346
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the increase in oil and natural gas sales in the State of New Mexico and the acquired
properties in the State of Colorado. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 26 and 22 , respectively. 

Results
of Operations Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2023. For the six months ended
September 30, 2024, there was net income of 608,237 compared to net income of 735,047 for the six months ended September 30, 2023.
This was a result of an increase in operating revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expenses that is further explained
below. 

Oil
and gas sales. Revenue from oil and gas sales was 3,383,909 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, a 9 increase from 3,095,800
for the same period of fiscal 2024. This resulted from an increase in oil and gas production and an increase in oil prices partially
offset by a decrease gas prices. The decrease in the natural gas price was, in part, due to temporary pipeline constraints on certain
properties and at certain times, prices were negative. The following table sets forth our oil and natural gas revenues, production quantities

Production
and exploration. Production costs were 850,825 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, a 15 increase from 742,081 for the
six months ended September 30, 2023. This is the result of an increase in production taxes and marketing charges as a result of the increase
in oil and gas revenues and an increase in lease operating expense on new wells in which we own an interest. 

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was 1,123,985 for the six months ended September 30,
2024, a 29 increase from 868,366 for the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the full cost pool amortization
base, an increase in oil and gas production, decrease in gas reserves partially offset by an increase in oil reserves. 

General
and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were 701,570 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, a 9 
increase from 646,512 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to an increase in accounting fess
and contract and engineering services. 

Income
taxes. Federal income tax for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 171,353. Federal income tax for the six months ended September
30, 2023 was 149,862. State income tax was 46,986 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, a 2 increase from 46,164 for the six
months ended September 30, 2023 due to the increase in oil and natural gas sales in the states that have state income tax. The effective
tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 26 and 21 , respectively.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The
primary source of market risk for us includes fluctuations in commodity prices. All of our financial instruments are for purposes other
than trading. 

Credit
Risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by other parties of their contractual obligations. Our primary
credit risk is related to oil and gas production sold to various purchasers and the receivables are generally not collateralized. At
September 30, 2024, our largest credit risk associated with any single purchaser was 529,614 or 58 of our total oil and gas receivables.
We have not experienced any significant credit losses. 

Energy
Price Risk . Our most significant market risk is the pricing applicable to our crude oil and natural gas production. Our financial
condition, results of operations, and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil
and natural gas. Pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this
volatility to continue in the future. 

Pipeline
capacity constraints and maintenance in the Permian Basin area has contributed to a wider difference between the WaHa Hub and the Henry
Hub and at times prices were negative. 

Factors
that can cause price fluctuations include the level of global demand for petroleum products, foreign and domestic supply of oil and gas,
the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil-exporting countries, weather conditions, the price and availability
of alternative fuels and overall political and economic conditions in oil producing and consuming countries. 

For
example, in the last twelve months, the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate WTI posted price for crude oil has ranged from
a low of 61.73 per bbl in September 2024 to a high of 86.77 per bbl in October 2023. The Henry Hub Spot Market Price Henry
Hub for natural gas has ranged from a low of 1.25 per MMBtu in March 2024 to a high of 3.34 per MMBtu in October 2023. On September
30, 2024, the WTI posted price for crude oil was 64.15 and the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas was 2.65 per MMBtu. See Results
of Operations above for the Company s realized prices during the three and six months. 

Declines
in oil and natural gas prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating
results. Changes in oil and gas prices impact both estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved reserves. Any reduction
in reserves, including reductions due to price fluctuations, can reduce the borrowing base under our credit facility and adversely affect
the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to obtain additional capital for our acquisition, exploration
and development activities. In addition, a noncash write-down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting
rules if prices declined significantly, even if it is only for a short period of time. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of crude
oil and natural gas that can be produced economically. Thus, we may experience material increases or decreases in reserve quantities
solely as a result of price changes and not as a result of drilling or well performance. 

Similarly,
any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources.
Oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. If the average oil price had increased
or decreased by ten dollars per barrel for the first six months of fiscal 2025, our operating revenues would have increased or decreased
by 392,340. If the average gas price had increased or decreased by one dollar per mcf for the first six months of fiscal 2025, our operating
revenues would have increased or decreased by 270,291. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that the information we must disclose
in our filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. At the end of the period covered by this
report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e). Based on such evaluation, such officers concluded that, as of September 30,
2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the six
months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
may, from time to time, be a party to various proceedings and claims incidental to our business. While many of these matters involve
inherent uncertainty, we believe that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to these proceedings and
claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position as a whole or on our liquidity, capital resources
or future results of operations.
