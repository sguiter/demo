1. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Of the model inputs outlined above, economic forecasts, weighting of economic forecasts, and recovery rates are subject to estimation uncertainty, and changes in these inputs could have a material impact to our allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we implemented a loan-level future default rate model that includes current portfolio characteristics and forecasts of real gross domestic product and college graduate unemployment. In the second quarter of 2024, we also implemented a future prepayment speeds model to include forecasts of real gross domestic product, retail sales, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), and the U.S. 10-year treasury rate. These models reduce the reliance on certain qualitative overlays compared to the previous default rate and prepayment speeds models. Prior to these changes, our loss models used forecasts of college graduate unemployment, retail sales, home price index, and median family income. Both the future default rate model and the future prepayment speeds model are used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The combined impact upon implementation of these model enhancements and the changes in the related qualitative overlays did not have a material impact on the overall level of our allowance for credit losses. 
 We obtain forecasts for our loss model inputs from Moody s Analytics. Moody s Analytics provides a range of forecasts for each of these inputs with various likelihoods of occurrence. We determine which forecasts we will include in our estimation of allowance for credit losses and the associated weightings for each of these inputs. At September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, we used the Baseline (50th percentile likelihood of occurring)/S1 (stronger near-term growth scenario - 10 percent likelihood of occurring)/S3 (unfavorable (or downside) scenario - 10 percent likelihood of occurring) and weighted them 40 percent, 30 percent, and 30 percent, respectively. Management reviews both the scenarios and their respective weightings each quarter in determining the allowance for credit losses.

 percent vertical risk retention interest (i.e., percent of each class issued in the securitizations). We classify those vertical risk retention interests related to the transactions as available-for-sale investments, except for the interest in the residual classes, which we classify as trading investments recorded at fair value with changes recorded through earnings. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, classified as trading investments.

 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of and of , respectively, of our available-for-sale securities were in an unrealized loss position. 
 Impairment 
 For available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria are met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through net income. For securities in an unrealized loss position that do not meet these criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit loss or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, as well as any guarantees (e.g., guarantees by the U.S. Government) that may be applicable to the security. If this assessment indicates a credit loss exists, the credit-related portion of the loss is recorded as an allowance for losses on the security. 
 Our investment portfolio contains mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, as well as Utah Housing Corporation bonds. We own these securities to meet our requirements under the Community Reinvestment Act CRA ). We also invest in other U.S. government-sponsored enterprise securities issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Farm Credit Bank. Our mortgage-backed securities that were issued under Ginnie Mae programs carry a full faith and credit guarantee from the U.S. Government. The remaining mortgage-backed securities in a net loss position carry a principal and interest guarantee by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, respectively. Our Treasury and other U.S. government-sponsored enterprise bonds are rated Aaa by Moody s Investors Service or AA+ by Standard and Poor s. We have the intent and ability to hold these bonds for a period of time sufficient for the market price to recover to at least the adjusted amortized cost of the security. Based on this qualitative analysis, we have determined that no credit impairment exists. 
 We periodically sell Private Education Loans through securitization transactions where we are required to retain a percent vertical risk retention interest. We classify the non-residual vertical risk retention interests as available-for-sale investments. We have the intent and ability to hold each of these bonds for a period of time sufficient for the market price to recover to at least the adjusted amortized cost of the security. We expect to receive all contractual cash flows related to these investments and do not consider a credit impairment to exist.

 Some of the mortgage-backed securities and a portion of the government securities have been pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank (the FRB as collateral against any advances and accrued interest under the Primary Credit lending program sponsored by the FRB. We had million and million par value of securities pledged to this borrowing facility at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as discussed further in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9, Borrowings in this Form 10-Q. 
 Other Investments 
 Investments in Non-Marketable Securities 
 We hold investments in non-marketable securities and account for these investments at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes of identical or similar securities of the same issuer. Changes in market value are recorded through earnings. Because these are non-marketable securities, we use observable price changes of identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or when observable prices are not available, use market data of similar entities, in determining any changes in the value of the securities. In the third quarter of 2024, we funded a new investment in non-marketable securities of an issuer whose securities we have not previously purchased. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our total investment in non-marketable securities was million and million, respectively.

million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. We are periodically required to provide additional financial support during the investment period. Our liability for these unfunded commitments was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. 
 Related to these investments, we recognized tax credits and other tax benefits through tax (benefit) expense of million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. Tax credits and other tax benefits are recognized as part of our annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. Accordingly, the portion of a year s expected tax benefits recognized in any given quarter may differ from percent.

 percent and percent, respectively, of all of our Private Education Loans were indexed to SOFR. We provide incentives for customers to include a cosigner on the loan, and the vast majority of Private Education Loans in our portfolio are cosigned. We also encourage customers to make payments while in school. 
 FFELP Loans are insured as to their principal and accrued interest in the event of default, subject to a risk-sharing level based on the date of loan disbursement. These insurance obligations are supported by contractual rights against the United States. For loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2006, we receive percent reimbursement on all qualifying claims. For loans disbursed after October 1, 1993 and before July 1, 2006, we receive percent reimbursement on all qualifying claims. For loans disbursed prior to October 1, 1993, we receive percent reimbursement on all qualifying claims. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we recognized million in gains from the sale of approximately billion of Private Education Loans, including billion of principal and million in capitalized interest, to unaffiliated third parties. In the first nine months of 2023, we recognized million in gains from the sale of approximately billion of Private Education Loans, including billion of principal and million in capitalized interest, to an unaffiliated third party. There were VIEs created in the execution of certain of these loan sales; however, based on our consolidation analysis, we are not the primary beneficiary of those VIEs. Those transactions qualified for sale treatment and removed the balance of the loans from our balance sheet on the respective settlement dates. We remained the servicer of those loans pursuant to applicable servicing agreements executed in connection with the sales. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9, Borrowings - Unconsolidated VIEs in this Form 10-Q.

 million compared with the year-ago period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was primarily affected by million in negative provisions recorded as a result of the billion Private Education Loan sales during the first nine months of 2024, an improved economic outlook, and changes in management overlays and recovery rates, offset by new loan commitments, net of expired commitments, and increases to the provision as a result of decreases in our estimates of the historical long-term average prepayment speeds used after the two-year reasonable and supportable period. In the year-ago period, the provision for credit losses was primarily affected by new loan commitments, net of expired commitments, slower prepayment rates, management overlays, and changes in economic outlook, which were offset by million in negative provisions recorded as a result of the billion Private Education Loan sales during the first nine months of 2023 and an increase in recovery rates. 
 As part of concluding on the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, we review key allowance and loan metrics. The most significant of these metrics considered are the allowance coverage of net charge-offs ratio; the allowance as a percentage of ending total loans and accrued interest to be capitalized and of ending loans in repayment and accrued interest to be capitalized on loans in repayment; and delinquency and forbearance percentages. 
 Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables whose borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. We use a discounted cash flow model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. 
 The effect of most modifications of loans made to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance. The forecast of expected future cash flows is updated as the loan modifications occur. 
 We adjust the terms of loans for certain borrowers when we believe such changes will help our customers manage their student loan obligations and achieve better student outcomes, and increase the collectability of the loans. These changes generally take the form of a temporary forbearance of payments, a temporary or permanent interest rate reduction, a temporary or permanent interest rate reduction with a permanent extension of the loan term, and/or a short-term extended repayment alternative. Forbearance is granted prospectively for borrowers who are current in their payments and may be granted retroactively for certain delinquent borrowers. 
 When we give a borrower facing financial difficulty an interest rate reduction under our programs, we evaluate their ability to pay and provide customized repayment terms based upon their financial condition. Prior to the third quarter of 2024, as part of demonstrating the ability and willingness to pay, the borrower was required to make three consecutive monthly payments at the reduced payment amount in order to qualify for enrollment in a modification program and, if applicable, for the loan to re-age and be brought current. Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, we refined our practices in this area and, after we determine the borrower s ability to pay and they agree to the modification, the loan is modified

5. Allowance for Credit Losses (Continued) 

 days past due as nonperforming. FFELP Loans are at least percent guaranteed as to their principal and accrued interest by the federal government in the event of default and, therefore, we do not deem FFELP Loans as nonperforming from a credit risk perspective at any point in their life cycle prior to claim payment and continue to accrue interest on those loans through the date of claim. 
 For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses, and Note 7, Allowance for Credit Losses in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Under our current forbearance practices, temporary forbearance of payments is generally granted in one -to- increments, for up to months over the life of the loan, with months of positive payment performance by a borrower required between grants (meaning the borrower must make payment in a cumulative amount equivalent to monthly required payments under the loan). See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Loans Held for Investment Certain Collection Tools - Private Education Loans in our 2023 Form 10-K. In the first quarter of 2022, we adopted ASU No. 2022-02 (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K). Under ASU No. 2022-02, if the debt has been previously restructured, an entity must consider the cumulative effect of past restructurings made within the 12-month period before the current restructuring when determining whether a delay in payment resulting from the current restructuring is insignificant. Due to our current forbearance practices, including the limitations on forbearances offered to borrowers, we do not believe the granting of forbearances will exceed the significance threshold and, therefore, we do not consider the forbearances as loan modifications. 
 The limitations on granting of forbearances described above apply to hardship forbearances. We offer other administrative forbearances (e.g., death and disability, bankruptcy, military service, disaster forbearance, and in school assistance) that are either required by law (such as by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act) or are considered separate from our active loss mitigation programs and therefore are not considered to be loan modifications requiring disclosure under ASU No. 2022-02. In addition, we may offer on a limited basis term extensions or rate reductions or a combination of both to borrowers to reduce consolidation activities. For purposes of this disclosure, we do not consider them modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and they therefore are not included in the tables below. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we developed additional modification programs tailored to the financial condition of individual borrowers. Pursuant to these additional modification programs, for our borrowers experiencing the most severe financial conditions, we currently may reduce the contractual interest rate on a loan to as low as percent for the remaining life of the loan and also permanently extend the final maturity of the loan. Other borrowers experiencing severe hardship may not require as much assistance, however, given their circumstances. In those instances, we may reduce the contractual interest rate on a loan to a rate greater than percent, and up to percent, for a temporary period of two to , and in some instances may also permanently extend the final maturity of the loan. These new programs are reflected in the tables below. 
 As part of the additional modification programs that were launched in the fourth quarter of 2023, we also offered for a short period of time a permanent term extension with no interest rate reduction program. This program ended in the fourth quarter of 2023. The amortized cost of this program totaled million, representing percent of the total Private Education Loan portfolio. This program added a weighted average of years to the life of loans in the program. As of September 30, 2024, million of these loans were in a current or deferred status, million of these loans were 30-59 days past due, million of these loans were 60-89 days past due, and million of these loans were 90 days or greater past due. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were million modified loans 1 (with mill

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were million modified loans 2 (with million of unpaid principal balance at the time the loan because 60 days past due) in this program that became 60 days past due within 12 months of receiving the term extension and million loans charged off within 12 months of receiving the term extension.

Private Education Loans are generally charged off at the end of the month in which they reach days delinquent or otherwise when the loans are classified as a loss by us or our regulator. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount.

percent of the securities issued by the trusts to meet risk retention requirements. We were not required to consolidate these entities because the fees we receive as the servicer/administrator are commensurate with our responsibility, so the fees are not considered a variable interest. Additionally, the percent vertical interest we maintain does not absorb more than an insignificant amount of the VIE s expected losses, nor do we receive more than an insignificant amount of the VIE s expected residual returns. 
 2024-A Transaction 
 On March 13, 2024, we closed an SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2024-A term ABS transaction (the 2024-A Transaction ), in which an unaffiliated third party sold to the trust approximately billion of Private Education Loans that the third-party seller previously purchased from us on February 1, 2024. Sallie Mae Bank sponsored the 2024-A Transaction, is the servicer and administrator, and was the seller of an additional million of Private Education Loans into the trust. The sale of such additional loans qualified for sale treatment and removed these loans from our balance sheet on the settlement date of the 2024-A Transaction and we recorded a million gain on sale associated with this transaction. In connection with the 2024-A Transaction settlement, we retained a percent vertical risk retention interest (i.e., percent of each class issued in the securitization). We classified those vertical risk retention interests related to the 2024-A Transaction as available-for-sale investments, except for the interest in the residual class, which we classified as a trading investment recorded at fair value with changes recorded through earnings. 
 2024-R1 Transaction 
 On April 9, 2024, we closed an SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2024-R1 term ABS transaction (the 2024-R1 Transaction ), in which an unaffiliated third party sold to the trust approximately million of Private Education Loan residual flows from our 2020-PTA and 2020-PTB transactions through a re-securitization. Sallie Mae Bank sponsored the 2024-R1 Transaction and is the administrator of the trust. In connection with the 2024-R1 Transaction settlement, we retained a percent vertical risk retention interest (i.e., percent of each class issued in the securitization). We classified those vertical risk retention interests related to the 2024-R1 Transaction as available-for-sale investments, except for the interest in the residual class, which we classified as a trading investment recorded at fair value with changes recorded through earnings. 
 2024-B Transaction 
 On April 11, 2024, we closed an SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2024-B term ABS transaction (the 2024-B Transaction ), in which unaffiliated third parties sold to the trust approximately million of Private Education Loans that the third-party sellers previously purchased from us in 2020 and 2021. Sallie Mae Bank sponsored the 2024-B Transaction, is the servicer and administrator, and was the seller of an additional million of Private Education Loans into the trust. The sale of such additional loans qualified for sale treatment and removed these loans from our balance sheet on the settlement date of the 2024-B Transaction and we recorded a less than million gain on sale associated with this transaction. In connection with the 2024-B Transaction settlement, we retained a percent vertical risk retention interest (i.e., percent of each class issued in the securitization). We classified those vertical risk retention interests related to the 2024-B Transaction as available-for-sale investments, except for the interest in the residual class, which we classified as a trading investment recorded at fair value with changes recorded through earnings. 
 2024-D Transaction 
 On June 28, 2024, we closed an SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2024-D term ABS transaction (the 2024-D Transaction ), in which an unaffiliated third party sold to the trust approximately billion of Private Education Loans that the third-party seller previously purchased from us on May 23, 2024. Sallie Mae Bank sponsored the 2024-D Transaction, is the servicer and administrator, and was the seller of an additional million of Private Education Loans into the trust. The sale of such additional loans qualified for sale treatment and removed these loans from our balance sheet on the settlement date of the 2024-D Transaction and we recorded a million gain on sale associated with this transaction. In connection with the 2024-D Transaction settlement, we retained a percent vertical risk retention interest (i.e., percent of each class issued in the securitization).

Other Borrowing Sources 
 We maintain discretionary uncommitted Federal Funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, which totaled million at September 30, 2024. The interest rate we are charged on these lines of credit is priced at Fed Funds plus a spread at the time of borrowing and is payable daily. We did not utilize these lines of credit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 nor in the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We established an account at the FRB to meet eligibility requirements for access to the Primary Credit borrowing facility at the FRB s Discount Window (the Window ). The Primary Credit borrowing facility is a lending program available to depository institutions that are in generally sound financial condition. All borrowings at the Window must be fully collateralized. We can pledge asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, as well as FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans, to the FRB as collateral for borrowings at the Window. Generally, collateral value is assigned based on the estimated fair value of the pledged assets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the value of our pledged collateral at the FRB totaled billion and billion, respectively. The interest rate charged to us is the discount rate set by the FRB. We did not utilize this facility in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 nor in the year ended December 31, 2023.

 of the central counterparties we use are the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME and the London Clearing House LCH ). All variation margin payments on derivatives cleared through the CME and LCH are accounted for as legal settlement. As of September 30, 2024, million notional of our derivative contracts were cleared on the CME and million were cleared on the LCH. The derivative contracts cleared through the CME and LCH represent percent and percent, respectively, of our total notional derivative contracts of million at September 30, 2024. 
 For derivatives cleared through the CME and LCH, the net gain (loss) position includes the variation margin amounts as settlement of the derivative and not collateral against the fair value of the derivative. The amount of variation margin included as settlement as of September 30, 2024 was ) million and ) million for the CME and LCH, respectively. Changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are presented as realized gains (losses). 
 Our exposure to the counterparty is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position less any collateral held and plus any collateral posted. When there is a net negative exposure, we consider our exposure to the counterparty to be zero. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a net positive exposure (derivative gain/loss positions to us, less collateral held by us and plus collateral posted with counterparties) related to derivatives of million and million, respectively.

Therefore, the regulatory capital impact of the Bank s transition adjustments recorded on January 1, 2020 from the adoption of CECL, and percent of the ongoing impact of CECL on the Bank s allowance for credit losses, retained earnings, and average total consolidated assets, each as reported for regulatory capital purposes (collectively, the adjusted transition amounts ), were deferred for the period ending January 1, 2022. On each of January 1, 2022, 2023, and 2024, percent of the adjusted transition amounts were phased in for regulatory capital purposes. On January 1, 2025, the remaining percent of the adjusted transition amounts will be phased in for regulatory capital purposes, with the phased in amounts included in regulatory capital at the beginning of the year. The Bank s January 1, 2020 CECL transition amounts increased our allowance for credit losses by billion, increased the liability representing our off-balance sheet exposure for unfunded commitments by million, and increased our deferred tax asset by million, resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment that reduced retained earnings by million. This transition adjustment was inclusive of qualitative adjustments incorporated into our CECL allowance as necessary, to address any limitations in the models used.

 The Bank s required and actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios, including applicable capital conservation buffers, under U.S. Basel III are shown in the following table. The following capital amounts and ratios are based upon the Bank s average assets and risk-weighted assets, as indicated. The Bank has elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to both available-for-sale investments and swap valuations from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unrealized loss on available-for-sale investments included in other comprehensive income totaled million and million, net of tax of million and million, respectively. The capital ratios would remain above the well capitalized thresholds, including applicable capital conservation buffers, if the unrealized loss became fully recognized into capital.

Bank Dividends 
 
 The Bank is chartered under the laws of the State of Utah and its deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to the laws of Utah and the regulations of the FDIC. Generally, under Utah s industrial bank laws and regulations as well as FDIC regulations, the Bank may pay dividends from its net profits without regulatory approval if, following the payment of the dividend, the Bank s capital and surplus would not be impaired. The Bank declared million and million in dividends to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million in dividends to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, with the proceeds primarily used to fund share repurchase programs and stock dividends.

 billion of outstanding contractual loan commitments that we expect to fund during the remainder of the 2024/2025 academic year. At September 30, 2024, we had a million reserve recorded in Other Liabilities to cover expected losses that may occur during the loss emergence period on these unfunded commitments. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses Off-Balance Sheet Exposure for Contractual Loan Commitments in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 6, Unfunded Loan Commitments in this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 In May 2014, the Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand CID from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB as part of the CFPB s separate investigation relating to customer complaints, fees, and charges assessed in connection with the servicing of student loans and related collection practices of pre-Spin-Off SLM by entities now subsidiaries of Navient Corporation Navient during a time period prior to the Spin-Off (the CFPB Investigation ). To the extent requested, the Bank has been cooperating fully with the CFPB. Given the timeframe covered by the CID and the CFPB Investigation, and the focus on practices and procedures previously conducted by Navient and its servicing subsidiaries prior to the Spin-Off, Navient is leading the response to these investigations. Consequently, we have no basis from which to estimate either the duration or ultimate outcome of this investigation. 
 We note that on January 18, 2017, the CFPB filed a complaint in federal court in Pennsylvania against Navient, along with its subsidiaries, Navient Solutions, Inc. and Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc. The complaint alleges these Navient entities, among other things, engaged in deceptive practices with respect to their historic servicing and debt collection practices. Neither SLM, the Bank, nor any of their current subsidiaries are named in, or otherwise a party to, the lawsuit and are not alleged to have engaged in any wrongdoing. The CFPB s complaint asserts Navient s assumption of these liabilities under the Separation and Distribution Agreement for alleged conduct that predated the Spin-Off. 
 On September 12, 2024, the federal court in Pennsylvania in the above-referenced lawsuit entered a Stipulated Final Judgment and Order that was agreed to by the CFPB and the Navient defendants to settle and resolve all matters in dispute arising from Navient s conduct alleged in the lawsuit. Neither SLM, the Bank, nor any of their current subsidiaries were named in, or otherwise a party to, that lawsuit, and no claims were asserted against them. The Company and the Bank were not parties to the settlement and have not contributed any of the relief to be provided in the settlement. 
 For additional information regarding our regulatory matters, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 21, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees in our 2023 Form 10-K. See also the section labeled History on page 3 of our 2023 Form 10-K for definitions and discussion regarding the Spin Off and pre-Spin-Off SLM. 
 Contingencies 
 In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings may be based on alleged violations of consumer protection, securities, employment, and other laws. In certain of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damage may be asserted against us and our subsidiaries. 
 It is common for the Company, our subsidiaries, and affiliates to receive information and document requests and investigative demands from state attorneys general, legislative committees, and administrative agencies. These requests may be for informational or regulatory purposes and may relate to our business practices, the industries in which we operate, or other companies with whom we conduct business. Our practice has been and continues to be to cooperate with these bodies and be responsive to any such requests.

Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis presents a review of our business and operations as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Key Financial Measures 
 Our operating results are primarily driven by net interest income from our Private Education Loan portfolio, gains and losses on loan sales, provision expense for credit losses, and operating expenses. The growth of our business and the strength of our financial condition are primarily driven by our ability to achieve our annual Private Education Loan origination goals while sustaining credit quality and maintaining cost-efficient funding sources to support our originations. A brief summary of our key financial measures (net interest income; loan sales and secured financings; allowance for credit losses; charge-offs and delinquencies; operating expenses; Private Education Loan originations; and funding sources) can be found in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Strategic Imperatives 
 To further focus our business and increase shareholder value, we continue to advance our strategic imperatives. Our focus remains on maximizing the profitability and growth of our core private student loan business, while harnessing and optimizing the power of our brand and attractive client base. In addition, we continue to seek to better inform the external narrative about student lending and Sallie Mae. We also strive to maintain a rigorous and predictable capital allocation and return program to create shareholder value. We are focused on driving a mission-led culture that continues to make Sallie Mae a great place to work. We also continue to strengthen our risk and compliance function, enhance and build upon our risk management framework, and assess and monitor enterprise-wide risk. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we made the following progress on the above corporate strategic imperatives. 
 2024-C Securitization 
 On May 15, 2024, we executed our 668 million SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2024-C term ABS transaction, which was accounted for as a secured financing. We sold 668 million of notes to third parties and retained a 100 percent interest in the residual certificates issued in the securitization, raising approximately 668 million of gross proceeds. The Class A and Class B notes had a weighted average life of 5.36 years and priced at a weighted average SOFR equivalent cost of SOFR plus 1.19 percent. 
 2024-E Securitization 
 On August 14, 2024, we executed our 868 million SMB Private Education Loan Trust 2024-E term ABS transaction, which was accounted for as a secured financing. We sold 868 million of notes to third parties and retained a 100 percent interest in the residual certificates issued in the securitization, raising approximately 868 million of gross proceeds. The Class A and Class B notes had a weighted average life of 5.17 years and priced at a weighted average SOFR equivalent cost of SOFR plus 1.42 percent. 
 2024 Loan Sales and 2024-A, 2024-B, and 2024-D Transactions 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we recognized 255 million in gains from the sale of approximately 3.69 billion of Private Education Loans, including 3.42 billion of principal and 274 million in capitalized interest, to unaffiliated third parties. The transactions qualified for sale treatment and removed the balance of the loans from our balance sheet on the respective settlement dates. We remained the servicer of these loans pursuant to applicable servicing agreements executed in connection with the sales. For additional information regarding these transactions, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3, Loans Held for Investment and Note 9, Borrowings - Unconsolidated VIEs in this Form 10-Q. 
 FFELP Loan Portfolio Transferred to Held for Sale 
 At September 30, 2024, we transferred the remaining 486 million FFELP Loan portfolio balance to held for sale because we intend to sell the portfolio to an unaffiliated third party. At September 30, 2024, we wrote down this loan portfolio to its estimated fair value through an adjustment to the allowance for credit losses of 8 million. 
 Secured Borrowing Facility 
 On May 7, 2024 and June 14, 2024, we amended our Secured Borrowing Facility to extend the maturity of the facility. The amount that can be borrowed under the facility is 2 billion. We hold 100 percent of the residual interest in the Secured Borrowing Facility trust. Under the Secured Borrowing Facility, we incur financing costs on unused borrowing capacity and on outstanding advances. The amended Secured Borrowing Facility extended the revolving period, during which we may borrow, repay, and reborrow funds, until June 13, 2025. The scheduled amortization period, during which amounts outstanding under the Secured Borrowing Facility must be repaid, ends on June 13, 2026 (or earlier, if certain material adverse events occur). 
 Share Repurchases under our Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 9.6 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of 204 million under Rule 10b5-1 trading plans authorized under our 2024 Share Repurchase Program.

GAAP Consolidated Earnings Summary 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to common stock was 50 million, or 0.23 loss per common share, compared with net income attributable to common stock of 25 million, or 0.11 diluted earnings per common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The primary drivers of changes in net loss for the current quarter compared with net income in the year-ago quarter are as follows: 
 Net interest income decreased by 26 million in the current quarter compared with the year-ago quarter primarily due to a 43-basis point decrease in our net interest margin and a 238 million decrease in our average Private Education Loans and FFELP Loans outstanding. Our net interest margin decreased in the current quarter from the year-ago quarter primarily because the yields on our interest-earning assets decreased but our cost of funds increased. This occurred primarily because the mix of our fixed-rate and variable-rate loans resulted in a higher proportion of fixed-rate loans in the current quarter. In a rising interest rate environment, as we experienced in 2022 and the beginning of 2023, our variable-rate loans repriced at higher rates than our fixed-rate loans. The impacts of the rising interest rate environment on our interest-bearing liabilities are delayed, resulting in a higher cost of funds in the current quarter. Additionally, the average cash and other short-term investments held in the current quarter is 939 million higher than in the year-ago quarter. 
 Provision for credit losses in the current quarter was 271 million, compared with 198 million in the year-ago quarter. During the third quarter of 2024, the increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily affected by new loan commitments, net of expired commitments. In the year-ago quarter, the provision for credit losses was primarily affected by new loan commitments, net of expired commitments, slower prepayment rates, management overlays, and changes in economic outlook. 
 There were no gains on sales of loans, net, in the current quarter or the year-ago quarter, as no loans were sold in either quarter. 
 Gains (losses) on securities, net, were 4 million of losses in the current quarter compared with 1 million in gains in the year-ago quarter. The change quarter-over-quarter was due to the change in mark-to-fair value of our trading investments. 
 Other income was 28 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 23 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a 6 million increase in third-party servicing fees compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase in third-party servicing fees was due to an additional 4.7 billion of loans that we sold during the past year where we continue to service on behalf of the owners of the loans. 
 Third-quarter 2024 total operating expenses were 171 million, compared with 167 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily driven by higher marketing costs and personnel costs, which were partially offset by reduced vendor costs associated with initiative spending. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded 1 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets, down from 3 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is a result of the impairment write-down of the Nitro trade name intangible asset taken in the fourth quarter of 2023. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7, Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets in this Form 10-Q. 
 Third-quarter 2024 income tax benefit was 14 million, compared with 11 million income tax expense in the year-ago quarter. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 24.2 percent in the third quarter of 2024 from 27.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in the effective rate for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income attributable to common stock was 483 million, or 2.18 diluted earnings per common share, compared with net income attributable to common stock of 400 million, or 1.69 diluted earnings per common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The primary drivers of changes in net income for the first nine months of 2024 compared with the first nine months of 2023 are as follows: 
 Net interest income decreased by 57 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with the year-ago period primarily due to a 27-basis point decrease in our net interest margin and a 308 million decrease in our average Private Education Loans and FFELP Loans outstanding. Our net interest margin decreased in the current period from the year-ago period primarily because our cost of funds increased more than the yields on our interest-earning assets. This occurred because as interest rates change, changes in the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities tend to lag compared to changes in the yields on our interest-earning assets. In a rising interest rate environment, as we experienced in 2022 and the first part of 2023, our variable-rate interest earning assets repriced faster than our cost of funds. As such, we saw an expansion in our net interest margin throughout most of 2023. As interest rates stabilized in the latter half of 2023 and into the first half of 2024, our cost of funds increased faster than our interest-earning assets yields and reduced our net interest margin. 
 Provision for credit losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 300 million, compared with 330 million in the year-ago period. During the first nine months of 2024, the decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily affected by 236 million negative provisions resulting from the 3.69 billion Private Education Loan sales during the period, an improved economic outlook, and changes in management overlays and recovery rates, offset by new loan commitments, net of expired commitments, and increases to the provision as a result of decreases in our estimates of the historical long-term average prepayment speeds used after the two-year reasonable and supportable period. In the year-ago period, the provision for credit losses was primarily affected by new loan commitments, net of expired commitments, slower prepayment rates, and management overlays, which were offset by negative provisions recorded as a result of Private Education Loan sales during the first nine months of 2023 and an increase in recovery rates. 
 Gains on sales of loans, net, were 255 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 125 million in the year-ago period. The increase in gains on sales of loans was primarily the result of selling 3.69 billion of Private Education Loans in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the sale of 2.10 billion of Private Education Loans in the first nine months of 2023. We also sold our Credit Card loan portfolio in May 2023 and recorded a 3.5 million loss on the sale in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gains (losses) on securities, net, were less than 1 million of gains in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 2 million in gains in the year-ago period. The decrease from the year-ago period was due to the change in mark-to-fair value of our trading investments. 
 Other income was 85 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with 63 million in the year-ago period. In the first nine months of 2024, there was a 17 million increase in third-party servicing fees from the year-ago period. The increase in third-party servicing fees was due to an additional 4.7 billion of loans that we sold during the past year where we continue to service on behalf of the owners of the loans. There was also a 3 million increase in early withdrawal penalty fee income compared with the year-ago period, which was related to a health savings account provider who redeemed its deposits early and paid an early withdrawal penalty in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Total operating expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were 488 million, compared with 476 million in the year-ago period. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel costs, higher marketing costs, and higher FDIC fees. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we recorded 4 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets, down from 7 million in the year-ago period. The decrease is a result of the impairment write-down of the Nitro trade name intangible asset taken in the fourth quarter of 2023. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7, Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets in this Form 10-Q. 
 Income tax expense for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 was 170 million, compared with 140 million in the year-ago period. Our effective income tax rate increased slightly to 25.5 percent in the first nine months of 2024 from 25.3 percent in the year-ago period. The increase in the effective rate for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in state income taxes.

Loan consolidations to third parties and Repayments and other are both significantly affected by the volume of loans in our held for investment portfolio in full principal and interest repayment status. The amount of loans in full principal and interest repayment status in our Private Education Loans held for investment portfolio at September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.8 percent compared with September 30, 2023, totaling 38 percent of our Private Education Loans held for investment portfolio at September 30, 2024. The balance of loans held for investment in full principal and interest repayment status was affected in 2023 and in the first nine months of 2024 by loan sales. 
 Loan consolidations to third parties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 total 2.5 percent of our Private Education Loans held for investment portfolio in full principal and interest repayment status at September 30, 2024, or 0.9 percent of our total Private Education Loans held for investment portfolio at September 30, 2024, compared with the year-ago period of 3.0 percent of our Private Education Loans held for investment portfolio in full principal and interest repayment status, or 1.2 percent of our total Private Education Loans held for investment portfolio, respectively. The decrease in consolidations is attributable to higher interest rates in 2024 that made it less competitive for consolidators. Historical experience has shown that loan consolidation activity is heightened in the period when the loan initially enters full principal and interest repayment status and then subsides over time. 
 65 

The Repayments and other category includes all scheduled repayments, as well as voluntary prepayments, made on loans in repayment (including loans in full principal and interest repayment status) and also includes charge-offs. Consequently, this category can be significantly affected by the volume of loans in repayment.

Private Education Loan Allowance for Credit Losses 
 In establishing the allowance for Private Education Loan losses as of September 30, 2024, we considered several factors with respect to our Private Education Loan portfolio, in particular, credit quality and delinquency, forbearance, and charge-off trends. 
 Private Education Loans held for investment in full principal and interest repayment status were 38 percent of our total Private Education Loans held for investment portfolio at both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 
 For a more detailed discussion of our policy for determining the collectability of Private Education Loans and maintaining our allowance for Private Education Loans, see Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Allowance for Credit Losses and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5, Loans Held for Investment Certain Collection Tools - Private Education Loans in the 2023 Form 10-K.

The table below presents our Private Education Loans held for investment portfolio delinquency trends. Loans in repayment include loans making interest only or fixed payments, as well as loans that have entered full principal and interest repayment status after any applicable grace period (but, for purposes of the following table, do not include those loans while they are in forbearance).

 (1) Deferment includes customers who have returned to school or are engaged in other permitted educational activities and are not yet required to make payments on the loans (e.g., residency periods for medical students or a grace period for bar exam preparation). 
 (2) Loans for customers who have requested extension of grace period generally during employment transition or who have temporarily ceased making full payments due to hardship or other factors, consistent with established loan program servicing policies and procedures. 
 (3) The period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due. 
 (4) We calculate the percentage of loans in an extended grace period as the ratio of (a) Private Education Loans in forbearance in an extended grace period numerator to (b) Private Education Loans in repayment and forbearance denominator. An extended grace period aligns with The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency definition of an additional, consecutive, one-time period during which no payment is required for up to six months after the initial grace period. We typically grant this extended grace period to customers who may be having difficulty finding employment before the full principal and interest repayment period starts or once it has begun. Loans in forbearance in an extended grace period were approximately 143 million and 30 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Use of Forbearance and Rate Modifications as a Private Education Loan Collection Tool below for additional details. 
 (5) We calculate the percentage of loans in hardship and other forbearances as the ratio of (a) Private Education Loans in hardship and other forbearances (excluding loans in an extended grace period) numerator to (b) Private Education Loans in repayment and forbearance denominator. If the customer is in financial hardship, we work with the customer and/or cosigner and identify any available alternative arrangements designed to reduce monthly payment obligations, which may include a short-term hardship forbearance. Loans in hardship and other forbearances (excluding loans in an extended grace period) were approximately 159 million and 183 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Use of Forbearance and Rate Modifications as a Private Education Loan Collection Tool below for additional details.

 (2) Loans in repayment include loans on which borrowers are making interest only or fixed payments, as well as loans that have entered full principal and interest repayment status after any applicable grace period (but, for purposes of the table, do not include those loans while they are in forbearance). 
 (3) Accrued interest to be capitalized on loans in repayment includes interest on loans that are in repayment but have not yet entered into full principal and interest repayment status after any applicable grace period (but, for purposes of the table, does not include the interest on those loans while they are in forbearance). 
 
 As part of concluding on the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, we review key allowance and loan metrics. The most significant of these metrics considered are the allowance coverage of net charge-offs ratio; the allowance as a percentage of ending total loans and accrued interest to be capitalized and of ending loans in repayment and accrued interest to be capitalized on loans in repayment; and delinquency and forbearance percentages.

Use of Forbearance and Rate Modifications as a Private Education Loan Collection Tool 
 We adjust the terms of loans for certain borrowers when we believe such changes will help our customers manage their student loan obligations and achieve better student outcomes, and increase the collectability of the loans. These changes generally take the form of a temporary forbearance of payments, a temporary or permanent interest rate reduction, a temporary or permanent interest rate reduction with a permanent extension of the loan term, and/or a short-term extended repayment alternative. Forbearance is granted prospectively for borrowers who are current in their payments and may be granted retroactively for certain delinquent borrowers. 
 Forbearance allows a borrower to not make scheduled payments for a specified period of time. Using forbearance extends the original term of the loan by the term of forbearance taken. Forbearance does not grant any reduction in the total principal or interest repayment obligation. While a loan is in forbearance status, interest continues to accrue and is capitalized (added to principal) at the end of the forbearance. Interest will not capitalize at the end of certain types of forbearance, such as disaster forbearance, however. 
 We grant forbearance through our servicing centers to borrowers who are current in their payments and through our collections centers to certain borrowers who are delinquent. Our forbearance policies and practices vary depending upon whether a borrower is current or delinquent at the time forbearance is requested, generally with stricter payment requirements for delinquent borrowers. We view the population of borrowers that use forbearance positively because the borrowers are either proactively reaching out to us to obtain assistance in managing their obligations or are working with our collections center to bring their loans current. 
 Forbearance may be granted through our servicing centers to customers who are exiting their grace period, and to other customers who are current in their payments, to provide temporary payment relief. In these circumstances, a customer s loan is placed into a forbearance status in limited monthly increments and is reflected in the forbearance status at month-end during this time. At the end of the forbearance period, the customer will enter repayment status as current and is expected to begin making scheduled monthly payments. 
 Forbearance may also be granted through our collections centers to customers who are delinquent in their payments. If specific payment requirements are met, the forbearance can cure the delinquency and the customer is returned to a current repayment status. Forbearance as a collection tool is used most effectively when applying historical experience and our judgment to a customer s unique situation. We leverage updated customer information and other decision support tools to best determine who will be granted forbearance based on our expectations as to a customer s ability and willingness to repay their obligation. This strategy is aimed at assisting customers while mitigating the risks of delinquency and default as well as encouraging resolution of delinquent loans. In most instances, we require one payment, as an indication of a customer s willingness and ability to repay, before granting forbearance to delinquent borrowers. 
 Historically, we have utilized disaster forbearance to assist borrowers affected by material events, typically federally-declared disasters, including hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and the COVID-19 pandemic. We typically grant disaster forbearance to affected borrowers in increments of up to three months at a time, but the disaster forbearance granted generally does not apply toward the 12-month forbearance limit described below. 
 Management continually monitors our credit administration practices, looking for opportunities to enhance and streamline, and may periodically modify these practices based upon performance, industry conventions, and/or regulatory feedback. 
 Currently, we generally grant forbearance in increments of one to two months at a time, for up to 12 months over the life of the loan, although disaster forbearance and certain assistance we grant to borrowers who are still in school do not apply toward the 12-month limit. We also currently require 12 months of positive payment performance by a borrower (meaning the borrower must make payment in a cumulative amount equivalent to 12 monthly required payments under the loan) between successive grants of forbearance and between forbearance grants and certain other repayment alternatives. This required period of positive payment performance does not apply, however, to forbearances granted during the first six months following a borrower s grace period extended grace period and is not required for a borrower to receive a contractual interest rate reduction. In addition, we currently limit the participation of delinquent borrowers in certain short-term extended or interest-only repayment alternatives to once in 12 months and twice in five years. We also now count the number of months a borrower receives a short-term extended repayment alternative toward the 12-month forbearance limit described above. 
 We also offer rate and term modifications to customers experiencing more severe hardship. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we developed additional modification programs tailored to the financial condition of individual borrowers. Pursuant to these additional modification programs, for our borrowers experiencing the most severe financial conditions, we 
 71 

currently may reduce the contractual interest rate on a loan to as low as 2 percent for the remaining life of the loan and also permanently extend the final maturity of the loan. Other borrowers experiencing severe hardship may not require as much assistance, however, given their circumstances. In those instances, we may reduce the contractual interest rate on a loan to a rate greater than 2 percent, and up to 8 percent, for a temporary period of two to four years, and in some instances may also permanently extend the final maturity of the loan. 
 When we give a borrower facing financial difficulty an interest rate reduction under our programs, we evaluate their ability to pay and provide customized repayment terms based upon their financial condition. Prior to the third quarter of 2024, as part of demonstrating the ability and willingness to pay, the borrower was required to make three consecutive monthly payments at the reduced payment amount in order to qualify for enrollment in a modification program and, if applicable, for the loan to re-age and be brought current. Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, we refined our practices in this area and, after we determine the borrower s ability to pay and they agree to the modification, the loan is modified immediately. Following the modification, the borrower is still required to make three consecutive monthly payments at the reduced payment amount in order for the loan to re-age and be brought current, if eligible. It continues to be our practice that any loan that has received a previous rate reduction or permanent extension is generally not re-age eligible following a modification. In that case, following the modification, the loan will remain in delinquency unless and until all past due amounts are paid and the loan is brought current. 
 Under our programs, we limit the granting of a permanent extension of the final maturity date of a loan to one time over the life of the loan, and limit the number of interest rate reductions to twice over the life of the loan. Where appropriate, we will permit two consecutive rate reductions so long as the borrower qualifies. We believe by tailoring the modification programs to the borrower s current financial condition and not having a one size fits all approach, we increase the likelihood the borrower will be able to make the modified payments and avoid default. This approach of giving different interest rate reductions to different borrowers experiencing more severe hardship also helps us better manage the overall assistance we provide to borrowers. 
 We expect to learn more about how our borrowers are reacting to changes in our credit administration practices and, as we analyze such reactions, we will continue to refine our estimates of the impact of those changes on our allowance for credit losses. 
 As discussed above, we will continue to monitor our credit administration practices and may modify them further from time to time based upon performance, industry conventions, and/or regulatory feedback. 
 
 Delinquency Trends by Active Repayment Status 
 The tables below show the composition and status of the Private Education Loan portfolio held for investment aged by number of months in active repayment status (months for which a scheduled monthly payment was due). Active repayment status includes loans on which borrowers are making interest only or fixed payments, as well as loans that have entered full principal and interest repayment status after any applicable grace period. Our experience shows that the percentage of loans in forbearance status generally decreases the longer the loans have been in active repayment status. At September 30, 2024, for Private Education Loans (held for investment) that have been in active repayment status for fewer than 25 months, loans in forbearance status as a percentage of all loans in repayment and forbearance were 1.5 percent. At September 30, 2024, approximately 76 percent of our Private Education Loans (held for investment) in forbearance status have been in active repayment status fewer than 25 months.

Accrued Interest Receivable 
 The following table provides information regarding accrued interest receivable on our Private Education Loans held for investment. The table also discloses the amount of accrued interest on loans 90 days or greater past due as compared to our allowance for uncollectible interest. The majority of the total accrued interest receivable represents accrued interest on deferred loans where no payments are due while the borrower is in school and fixed-pay loans where the borrower makes a 25 monthly payment that is smaller than the interest accruing on the loan in that month. The accrued interest on these loans will be capitalized to the balance of the loans when the borrower exits the grace period after separation from school, and the current expected credit losses on accrued interest that will be capitalized is included in our allowance for credit losses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 
 Our primary liquidity needs include our ongoing ability to fund our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress, our ongoing ability to fund originations of Private Education Loans, and our ability to meet any outflows of our Bank deposits. To achieve these objectives, we analyze and monitor our liquidity needs, and maintain excess liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, such as deposits at the Bank, issuance of secured debt primarily through asset-backed securitizations, other financing facilities, and loan sales. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our sources of liquidity included liquid investments with unrealized losses of 84.9 million and 128.9 million, respectively. It is our policy to manage operations so liquidity needs are fully satisfied through normal operations to avoid unplanned loan or liquid investment sales under all but the most dire emergency conditions. Our liquidity management is governed by policies approved by our Board of Directors. Oversight of these policies is performed in the Asset and Liability Committee, a management-level committee. These policies take into account the volatility of cash flow forecasts, expected asset and liability maturities, anticipated loan demand, and a variety of other factors to establish minimum liquidity guidelines. 
 Key risks associated with our liquidity relate to our ability to access the capital markets and the markets for bank deposits at reasonable rates. This ability may be affected by our performance, competitive pressures, the macroeconomic environment, and the impact they have on the availability of funding sources in the marketplace. We target maintaining sufficient on-balance sheet and contingent sources of liquidity to enable us to meet all contractual and contingent obligations under various stress scenarios, including severe macroeconomic stresses as well as specific stresses that test the resiliency of our balance sheet. We hold a significant liquidity buffer of cash and securities, which we expect to maintain through 2024. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, our liquidity levels will likely vary from quarter to quarter.

Deposits 
 The following table summarizes total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 September 30, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Deposits - interest-bearing 21,444,710 21,651,657 Deposits - non-interest-bearing 747 1,531 Total deposits 21,445,457 21,653,188 
 
 Our total deposits of 21.4 billion were comprised of 9.8 billion in brokered deposits and 11.6 billion in retail and other deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to total deposits of 21.7 billion, which were comprised of 10.3 billion in brokered deposits and 11.4 billion in retail and other deposits, at December 31, 2023. 
 Interest-bearing deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of retail and brokered non-maturity savings deposits, retail and brokered non-maturity MMDAs, and retail and brokered CDs. Interest-bearing deposits also include deposits from Educational 529 and Health Savings plans that diversify our funding sources and that we consider to be core. These and other large omnibus accounts, aggregating the deposits of many individual depositors, represented 7.0 billion and 7.6 billion of our deposit total as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The omnibus accounts are structured in such a way that entitles the individual depositor pass-through deposit insurance (subject to FDIC rules and limitations), and the majority of these deposits have contractual minimum balances and maturity terms. 
 Some of our deposit products are serviced by third-party providers. Placement fees associated with the brokered CDs are amortized into interest expense using the effective interest rate method. We recognized placement fee expense of 3 million and 3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and placement fee expense of 8 million and 9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Fees paid to third-party brokers related to brokered CDs were 6 million and 4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and fees paid to third-party brokers related to brokered CDs were 6 million and 7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Interest bearing deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows:

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 513 million and 478 million, respectively, of deposits exceeding FDIC insurance limits. Accrued interest on deposits was 70 million and 91 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Counterparty Exposure 
 Counterparty exposure related to financial instruments arises from the risk that a lending, investment, or derivative counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to us. 
 Excess cash is generally invested with the FRB on an overnight basis or in the FRB s Term Deposit Facility, minimizing counterparty exposure on cash balances. 
 Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of a small portfolio of mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises that are purchased to meet CRA targets. Additionally, our 
 76 

investing activity is governed by Board-approved limits on the amount that is allowed to be invested with any one issuer based on the credit rating of the issuer, further minimizing our counterparty exposure. Counterparty credit risk is considered when valuing investments and considering impairment. 
 Related to derivative transactions, protection against counterparty risk is generally provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Credit Support Annexes CSAs ), or clearinghouses for over-the-counter derivatives. CSAs require a counterparty to post collateral if a potential default would expose the other party to a loss. All derivative contracts entered into by the Bank are covered under CSAs or clearinghouse agreements and require collateral to be exchanged based on the net fair value of derivatives with each counterparty. Our exposure to the counterparty is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position, less any collateral held by us and plus collateral posted with the counterparty. 
 Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act requires all standardized derivatives, including most interest rate swaps, to be submitted for clearing to central counterparties to reduce counterparty risk. Two of the central counterparties we use are the CME and the LCH. All variation margin payments on derivatives cleared through the CME and LCH are accounted for as legal settlement. As of September 30, 2024, 855 million notional of our derivative contracts were cleared on the CME and 88 million were cleared on the LCH. The derivative contracts cleared through the CME and LCH represent 90.6 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, of our total notional derivative contracts of 943 million at September 30, 2024. 
 For derivatives cleared through the CME and LCH, the net gain (loss) position includes the variation margin amounts as settlement of the derivative and not collateral against the fair value of the derivative. The amount of variation margin included as settlement as of September 30, 2024 was (20) million and (1) million for the CME and LCH, respectively. Changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are presented as realized gains (losses). 
 Our exposure to the counterparty is limited to the value of the derivative contracts in a gain position less any collateral held and plus any collateral posted. When there is a net negative exposure, we consider our exposure to the counterparty to be zero. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a net positive exposure (derivative gain/loss positions to us, less collateral held by us and plus collateral posted with counterparties) related to derivatives of 6 million and 9 million, respectively. 
 We have liquidity exposure related to collateral movements between us and our derivative counterparties. Movements in the value of the derivatives, which are primarily affected by changes in interest rates, may require us to return cash collateral held or may require us to access primary liquidity to post collateral to counterparties. 
 The table below highlights exposure related to our derivative counterparties as of September 30, 2024.

 Regulatory Capital 
 The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking authorities. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Under U.S. Basel III and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital standards that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and its classification under the prompt corrective action framework are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 77 

Capital Management 
 The Bank intends to maintain at all times regulatory capital levels that meet both the minimum levels required under U.S. Basel III (including applicable buffers) and the levels necessary to be considered well capitalized under the FDIC s prompt corrective action framework, in order to support asset growth and operating needs, address unexpected credit risks, and protect the interests of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the FDIC. The Bank s Capital Policy requires management to monitor these capital standards and the Bank s compliance with them. The Board of Directors and management periodically evaluate the quality of assets, the stability of earnings, and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses for the Bank. The Company is a source of strength for the Bank and will provide additional capital if necessary. 
 We believe that current and projected capital levels are appropriate for 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s risk-based and leverage capital ratios exceed the required minimum ratios and the applicable buffers under the fully phased-in U.S. Basel III standards as well as the well capitalized standards under the prompt corrective action framework. 
 Under U.S. Basel III, the Bank is required to maintain the following minimum regulatory capital ratios: a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 percent, a Total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 percent. In addition, the Bank is subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 percent. Failure to maintain the buffer will result in restrictions on the Bank s ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Including the buffer, the Bank is required to maintain the following capital ratios under U.S. Basel III in order to avoid such restrictions: a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 7.0 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 8.5 percent, and a Total risk-based capital ratio of greater than 10.5 percent. 
 To qualify as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework for insured depository institutions, the Bank must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, a Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent. 
 In July 2023, the federal banking agencies proposed a rule to implement significant changes to the U.S. Basel Ill regulatory capital requirements. The proposed changes to the regulatory capital requirements generally would amend or introduce approaches and methodologies that would apply to banking organizations with total consolidated assets of 100 billion or more or to banking organizations with significant trading activity. The proposed rule therefore would not affect the Bank's capital requirements or the calculation of its capital ratios. 
 Under regulations issued by the FDIC and other federal banking agencies, banking organizations that adopted CECL during the 2020 calendar year, including the Bank, could elect to delay for two years, and then phase in over the following three years, the effects on regulatory capital of CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The Bank elected to use this option. Therefore, the regulatory capital impact of the Bank s transition adjustments recorded on January 1, 2020 from the adoption of CECL, and 25 percent of the ongoing impact of CECL on the Bank s allowance for credit losses, retained earnings, and average total consolidated assets, each as reported for regulatory capital purposes (collectively, the adjusted transition amounts ), were deferred for the two-year period ending January 1, 2022. On each of January 1, 2022, 2023, and 2024, 25 percent of the adjusted transition amounts were phased in for regulatory capital purposes. On January 1, 2025, the remaining 25 percent of the adjusted transition amounts will be phased in for regulatory capital purposes, with the phased in amounts included in regulatory capital at the beginning of the year. The Bank s January 1, 2020 CECL transition amounts increased our allowance for credit losses by 1.1 billion, increased the liability representing our off-balance sheet exposure for unfunded commitments by 116 million, and increased our deferred tax asset by 306 million, resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment that reduced retained earnings by 953 million. This transition adjustment was inclusive of qualitative adjustments incorporated into our CECL allowance as necessary, to address any limitations in the models used. 
 78 

At September 30, 2024, the adjusted transition amounts that were deferred and are being phased in for regulatory capital purposes are as follows: 
 Adjusted Transition Amounts Phase-In Amounts for the Year Ended Phase-In Amounts for the Year Ended Phase-In Amounts for the Nine Months Ended Remaining Adjusted Transition Amounts to be Phased-In (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 Retained earnings 836,351 (209,088) (209,088) (209,088) 209,087 Allowance for credit losses 1,038,145 (259,536) (259,536) (259,536) 259,537 Liability for unfunded commitments 104,377 (26,094) (26,094) (26,095) 26,094 Deferred tax asset 306,171 (76,542) (76,542) (76,543) 76,544 
 
 The Bank s required and actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios, including applicable capital conservation buffers, under U.S. Basel III are shown in the following table. The following capital amounts and ratios are based upon the Bank s average assets and risk-weighted assets, as indicated. The Bank has elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to both available-for-sale investments and swap valuations from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unrealized loss on available-for-sale investments included in other comprehensive income totaled 69 million and 115 million, net of tax of 22 million and 37 million, respectively. The capital ratios would remain above the well capitalized thresholds, including applicable capital conservation buffers, if the unrealized loss became fully recognized into capital.

Dividends 
 The Bank is chartered under the laws of the State of Utah and its deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to the laws of Utah and the regulations of the FDIC. Generally, under Utah s industrial bank laws and regulations as well as FDIC regulations, the Bank may pay dividends from its net profits without regulatory approval if, following the payment of the dividend, the Bank s capital and surplus would not be impaired. The Bank declared 116 million and 414 million in dividends to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 100 million and 400 million in dividends to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, with the proceeds primarily used to fund share repurchase programs and stock dividends. In the future, we expect that the Bank will pay dividends to the Company as may be necessary to enable the Company to pay any declared dividends on its Series B Preferred Stock and common stock and to consummate any common share repurchases by the Company under its share repurchase programs. 
 
 Borrowings 
 Outstanding borrowings consist of unsecured debt and secured borrowings issued through our term ABS program and our Secured Borrowing Facility. The issuing entities for those secured borrowings are VIEs and are consolidated for accounting purposes. The following table summarizes our borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9, Borrowings in this Form 10-Q.

 Short-term Borrowings 
 On May 7, 2024 and June 14, 2024, we amended our Secured Borrowing Facility to extend the maturity of the facility. The amount that can be borrowed under the facility is 2 billion. We hold 100 percent of the residual interest in the Secured Borrowing Facility trust. Under the Secured Borrowing Facility, we incur financing costs on unused borrowing capacity and on outstanding advances. The amended Secured Borrowing Facility extended the revolving period, during which we may borrow, repay, and reborrow funds, until June 13, 2025. The scheduled amortization period, during which amounts outstanding under the Secured Borrowing Facility must be repaid, ends on June 13, 2026 (or earlier, if certain material adverse events occur). At both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were no secured borrowings outstanding under the Secured Borrowing Facility. 
 Other Borrowing Sources 
 We maintain discretionary uncommitted Federal Funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, which totaled 125 million at September 30, 2024. The interest rate we are charged on these lines of credit is priced at Fed Funds plus a spread at the time of borrowing and is payable daily. We did not utilize these lines of credit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 nor in the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 80 

We established an account at the FRB to meet eligibility requirements for access to the Primary Credit borrowing facility at the FRB s Window. The Primary Credit borrowing facility is a lending program available to depository institutions that are in generally sound financial condition. All borrowings at the Window must be fully collateralized. We can pledge asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, as well as FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans, to the FRB as collateral for borrowings at the Window. Generally, collateral value is assigned based on the estimated fair value of the pledged assets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the value of our pledged collateral at the FRB totaled 2.3 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively. The interest rate charged to us is the discount rate set by the FRB. We did not utilize this facility in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 nor in the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Contractual Loan Commitments 
 When we approve a Private Education Loan at the beginning of an academic year, that approval may cover the borrowing for the entire academic year. As such, we do not always disburse the full amount of the loan at the time of such approval, but instead have a commitment to fund a portion of the loan at a later date (usually at the start of the second semester or subsequent trimesters). We estimate expected credit losses over the contractual period in which we are exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by us. At September 30, 2024, we had 2.5 billion of outstanding contractual loan commitments that we expect to fund during the remainder of the 2024/2025 academic year. At September 30, 2024, we had a 92 million reserve recorded in Other Liabilities to cover expected losses that may occur during the one-year loss emergence period on these unfunded commitments. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses Off-Balance Sheet Exposure for Contractual Loan Commitments in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 6, Unfunded Loan Commitments in this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. 
 The critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to the allowance for credit losses. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current and, for some estimates, including management overlays, future economic and market conditions. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in a change in the allowance for credit losses or material changes to our consolidated financial statements. A discussion of our critical accounting policies can be found in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses for the lifetime expected credit losses on loans in our portfolios, as well as for future loan commitments, at the reporting date. 
 In determining the lifetime expected credit losses on our Private Education Loan portfolio loan segments, we use a discounted cash flow method. This method requires us to project future principal and interest cash flows on our loans in those portfolios. 
 To estimate the future expected cash flows, we use statistical loan-level models that consider life of loan expectations for defaults, prepayments, recoveries, and any other qualitative adjustments deemed necessary, to determine the adequacy of the allowance at each balance sheet date. These cash flows are discounted at the loan s effective interest rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Management adjusts the effective interest rate used to discount expected cash flows to incorporate expected prepayments. The difference between the present value of those cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the underlying loans is the allowance for credit losses. Entities that measure credit losses based on the present value of expected future cash flows are permitted to report the entire change in present value as credit loss expense, but may alternatively report the change in present value due to the passage of time as interest income. We have elected to report the entire change in present value as credit loss expense. 
 We estimate future default rates used in our current expected credit losses at a loan level using historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, and economic factors forecasted over a reasonable and supportable period. At the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we immediately revert our forecasted economic factors to long-term historical averages.

We estimate future prepayment speeds used in our current expected credit losses at a loan level using historical prepayment experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, and economic factors forecasted over a reasonable and supportable period. At the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we immediately revert our forecasted economic factors to long-term historical averages. 
 The reasonable and supportable forecast period is meant to represent the period in which we believe we can estimate the impact of forecasted economic factors in our expected losses. We use a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, although this period is subject to change as our view evolves on our ability to reasonably forecast economic conditions to estimate future losses. 
 In estimating future default rates and prepayment speeds in our current expected credit losses, we use a combination of expected economic scenarios coupled with our historical experience to derive a base case adjusted for any qualitative factors (as described below). We also develop an adverse and favorable economic scenario. At each reporting date, we determine the appropriate weighting of these alternate scenarios based upon the current economic conditions and our view of the risks of alternate outcomes. This weighting of expectations is used in calculating our current expected credit losses recorded each period. 
 In estimating recoveries, we use both estimates of what we would receive from the sale of defaulted loans as well as historical borrower payment behavior to estimate the timing and amount of future recoveries on charged-off loans. 
 In addition to the above modeling approach, we also take certain other qualitative factors into consideration when calculating the allowance for credit losses, which could result in management overlays (increases or decreases to the allowance for credit losses). These management overlays can encompass a broad array of factors not captured by model inputs, including, but not limited to, changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards, changes in servicing policies and collection administration practices, state law changes that could impact servicing and collection practices, charge-offs, recoveries not already included in the analysis, the effect of other external factors such as legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated current expected credit losses, the performance of the model over time versus actual losses, and any other operational or regulatory changes that could affect our estimate of future losses. 
 The evaluation of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes. If actual future performance in delinquency, charge-offs, and recoveries is significantly different than estimated, or management assumptions or practices were to change, this could materially affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses, the timing of when losses are recognized, and the related provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income. 
 When calculating our allowance for credit losses and liability for unfunded commitments, we incorporate several inputs that are subject to change period to period. These include, but are not limited to, CECL model inputs and any overlays deemed necessary by management. The most impactful CECL model inputs include: 
 Economic forecasts; 
 Weighting of economic forecasts; and 
 Recovery rates. 
 Of the model inputs outlined above, economic forecasts, weighting of economic forecasts, and recovery rates are subject to estimation uncertainty, and changes in these inputs could have a material impact to our allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we implemented a loan-level future default rate model that includes current portfolio characteristics and forecasts of real gross domestic product and college graduate unemployment. In the second quarter of 2024, we also implemented a future prepayment speeds model to include forecasts of real gross domestic product, retail sales, SOFR, and the U.S. 10-year treasury rate. These models reduce the reliance on certain qualitative overlays compared to the previous default rate and prepayment speeds models. Prior to these changes, our loss models used forecasts of college graduate unemployment, retail sales, home price index, and median family income. Both the future default rate model and the future prepayment speeds model are used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The combined impact upon implementation of these model enhancements and the changes in the related qualitative overlays did not have a material impact on the overall level of our allowance for credit losses. 
 We obtain forecasts for our loss model inputs from Moody s Analytics. Moody s Analytics provides a range of forecasts for each of these inputs with various likelihoods of occurrence. We determine which forecasts we will include in our estimation of allowance for credit losses and the associated weightings for each of these inputs. At September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, we used the Baseline (50th percentile likelihood of occurring)/S1 
 82 

(stronger near-term growth scenario - 10 percent likelihood of occurring)/S3 (unfavorable (or downside) scenario - 10 percent likelihood of occurring) and weighted them 40 percent, 30 percent, and 30 percent, respectively. Management reviews both the scenarios and their respective weightings each quarter in determining the allowance for credit losses. 
 To demonstrate the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses for our Private Education Loan portfolio to a more pessimistic forecast of expected economic outcomes, we considered what our allowance for credit losses would be if we applied a 100 percent probability weighting to the S3 unfavorable (or downside) scenario (with a concomitant 0 percent weighting for both the Baseline and S1 stronger near-term growth scenarios) under the range of scenarios noted above. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 of 175 million or 11.6 percent. This scenario does not reflect our current expectations as of September 30, 2024, nor does it capture other qualitative adjustments or all the potential unknown variables that could arise in the forecast period, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under hypothetical pessimistic conditions. The estimated impact was calculated for the two-year reasonable and supportable period, but was not calculated for the remaining periods since long-term assumptions used to calculate the allowance for the remaining periods are based on longer term averages and only change when we determine there is a fundamental change that will affect the long-term rate.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 
 Our interest rate risk management program seeks to manage and control interest rate risk, thereby reducing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, and achieving consistent and acceptable levels of profit in any rate environment and sustainable growth in net interest income over the long term. We evaluate and monitor interest rate risk through two primary methods: 
 Earnings at Risk EAR ), which measures the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on net interest income; and 
 Economic Value of Equity EVE ), which measures the sensitivity or change in the economic value of equity to changes in interest rates. 
 A number of potential interest rate scenarios are simulated using our asset liability management system. The Bank is the primary source of interest rate risk within the Company. At September 30, 2024, a significant portion of the Bank s earning assets and a large balance of deposits were indexed to 30-day average SOFR. Therefore, 30-day average SOFR is considered a core rate in our interest rate risk analysis. The 30-day average SOFR and other rates are shocked in parallel for shock scenarios unless otherwise indicated. Rates are adjusted up or down via a set of scenarios that includes both rate shocks and ramps. Rate shocks represent an immediate and sustained change in key rates, with the resulting changes in other indices correlated accordingly. Interest rate ramps represent a linear increase in those key rates over the course of 12 months, with the resulting changes in other indices correlated accordingly. 
 The following table summarizes the potential effect on earnings over the next 24 months and the potential effect on market values of balance sheet assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024 and 2023, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming hypothetical increases in market interest rates of 100 and 300 basis points and a decrease of 100 and 300 basis points while credit and funding spreads remain constant. EAR analysis assumes a static balance sheet, with maturities of each product replaced with assumed issuance of new products of the same type. The EVE sensitivity is applied only to financial assets and liabilities, including hedging instruments, that existed at the balance sheet date, and does not reflect any impact of loan sales, new assets, liabilities, commitments, or hedging instruments that may arise in the future. 
 The EAR results for September 30, 2024 indicate a market risk profile of low sensitivity to rate changes, based on static balance sheet assumptions over the next two years. The higher mix of fixed-rate versus variable-rate loan disbursements continues, which results in our liabilities repricing more quickly than our assets over time. Planned loan sales, which are not included in the static EVE modeling, significantly reduce this exposure. The recent Fed Funds Effective Rate reduction and the corresponding rate decrease in other indices has improved EVE sensitivity as compared to the year-ago period. Management continues to evaluate this trend to determine if and when further actions are necessary to manage EVE sensitivity. 
 2024 2023 As of September 30, 
 +300 Basis Points +100 Basis Points -100 Basis Points -300 Basis Points +300 Basis Points +100 Basis Points -100 Basis Points -300 Basis Points EAR - Shock -7.0 -2.2 +1.9 +5.3 -2.5 -0.8 +0.5 +1.5 EAR - Ramp -4.0 -1.3 +1.1 +3.2 -2.2 -0.7 +0.6 +1.6 EVE -21.3 -7.0 +6.6 +20.8 -25.1 -8.7 +8.8 +26.5 

In the preceding tables, the interest rate sensitivity analysis reflects the balance sheet mix of fixed-rate loans and funding as well as fully variable SOFR-based loans, and fully variable funding, including brokered CDs that have been converted to SOFR through derivative transactions. The analysis assumes that retail MMDAs and retail savings balances, while relatively sensitive to interest rate changes, will not correlate 100 percent to the full interest rate shocks or ramps. 
 84 

Also considered is the impact of FFELP Loans, which receive floor income in low interest rate environments, and will therefore not reprice fully with interest rate shocks. 
 Although we believe that these measurements provide an estimate of our interest rate sensitivity, they do not account for potential changes in credit quality, balance sheet mix, and size of our balance sheet. They also do not account for other business developments that could affect net income, or for management actions that could affect net income or could be taken to change our risk profile. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that actual results would not differ materially from the estimated outcomes of our simulations. Further, such simulations do not represent our current view of expected future interest rate movements. 
 Asset and Liability Funding Gap 
 The table below presents our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of September 30, 2024. In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest income, as opposed to those reflected in the gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net line on the consolidated statements of operations). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents, at a high level, our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude. (Note that all fixed-rate assets and liabilities are aggregated into one line item, which does not capture the differences in time due to maturity.) 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 
 (dollars in millions)

 Frequency of Variable Resets Assets Funding (1)

 (1) Funding (by index) includes the impact of all derivatives that qualify as effective hedges. 
 (2) Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes liquid retail deposits and the obligation to return cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures. 
 (3) Assets include receivables and other assets (including premiums and reserves). Funding includes unswapped time deposits, liquid MMDAs swapped to fixed-rates, and stockholders' equity. 
 
 The Funding Gap in the above table shows primarily mismatches in the Fed Funds Effective Rate, SOFR rate, 3-month SOFR, Non-Discrete reset, and fixed-rate categories. Changes in the Fed Funds Effective Rate, the Non-Discrete reset, and the daily, weekly, and monthly SOFR, and 3-month SOFR categories are generally quite highly correlated and the rates would be expected to offset each other relatively effectively. The funding in the fixed-rate bucket includes 1.9 billion of equity and 0.4 billion of non-interest bearing liabilities. We consider the overall repricing risk to be moderate, which is supported by other analyses of interest rate sensitivity. 
 We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. Our asset liability management strategy is to match assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that have the same underlying index and reset frequency or have interest rate characteristics that we believe are highly correlated. The use of funding with index types and reset frequencies that are different from our assets exposes us to interest rate risk in the form of basis and repricing risk. This could result in our cost of funds not moving in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the yield on our assets. While we believe this risk is low, as all of these indices are short-term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions (which have occurred in recent years) can lead to a temporary divergence between indices, resulting in a negative impact to our earnings.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We and our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to various claims, lawsuits, and other actions that arise in the normal course of business. It is common for the Company, our subsidiaries, and affiliates to receive information and document requests and investigative demands from state attorneys general, legislative committees, and administrative agencies. These requests may be for informational or regulatory purposes and may relate to our business practices, the industries in which we operate, or other companies with whom we conduct business. Our practice has been and continues to be to cooperate with these bodies and be responsive to any such requests. 
 On January 18, 2017, the CFPB filed a complaint in federal court in Pennsylvania against Navient, along with its subsidiaries, Navient Solutions, Inc. and Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc. The complaint alleges these Navient entities, among other things, engaged in deceptive practices with respect to their historic servicing and debt collection practices. Neither SLM, the Bank, nor any of their current subsidiaries are named in, or otherwise a party to, the lawsuit and are not alleged to have engaged in any wrongdoing. The CFPB s complaint asserts Navient s assumption of these liabilities under the Separation and Distribution Agreement for alleged conduct that predated the Spin-Off. 
 On September 12, 2024, the federal court in Pennsylvania in the above-referenced lawsuit entered a Stipulated Final Judgment and Order that was agreed to by the CFPB and the Navient defendants to settle and resolve all matters in dispute arising from Navient s conduct alleged in the lawsuit. Neither SLM, the Bank, nor any of their current subsidiaries were named in, or otherwise a party to, that lawsuit, and no claims were asserted against them. The Company and the Bank were not parties to the settlement and have not contributed any of the relief to be provided in the settlement. 
 For additional information regarding our legal proceedings, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Form 10-K. See also the section labeled History on page 3 of our 2023 Form 10-K for definitions and discussion regarding the Spin Off and pre-Spin-Off SLM.
