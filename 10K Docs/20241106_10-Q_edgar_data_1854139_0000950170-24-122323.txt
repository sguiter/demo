In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as anticipate, believe, consider, contemplate, continue, could, estimate, expect, forecast, guidance, intend, may, on track, outlook, plan, potential, predict, project, pursue, seek, should, target, will or would or the negative of these words or other similar words, terms or expressions. 
 You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and operating results. All of the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 6, 2024 for the period ended December 31, 2023 Annual Report ), as well as our subsequent filings with the SEC. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 failure to further develop, maintain, and promote our brand; 

changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers; 

product safety and quality concerns, including those relating to our plant-based sweetening system, which could negatively affect our business by exposing us to lawsuits, product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings; 

change in consumer preferences, perception and spending habits, particularly due to impacts of inflation, in the commercial beverage industry and on zero sugar, naturally sweetened products, and failure to develop or enrich our product offerings or gain market acceptance of our products, including new offerings;

substantial disruption within our supply chain or distribution channels, including disruption at our contract manufacturers, warehouse and distribution facilities, failure by our transportation providers to facilitate on-time deliveries, or our own failure to accurately forecast; 

extensive governmental regulation and enforcement if we are not in compliance with applicable requirements; 

changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging as well as marketing and labeling; 

dependence on distributions from Zevia LLC to pay any taxes and other expenses;

of the total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding on the preceding December 31, or (ii) a smaller number of shares determined by the Company s Board of Directors. In October and November 2021, the Company s Board of Directors approved an amendment to its equity-based compensation plans for a certain number of employees to allow immediate vesting upon retirement of all outstanding RSUs and stock options, and to extend the exercisability of outstanding stock options up to five years after retirement, if they meet certain conditions, including a resignation after the holder has reached 50 years of age with at least 10 years of service to the Company, so long as the holder provides advance notice of his or her resignation to the Company s Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2024, the 2021 Plan provides for future grants and/or issuances of up to approximately million shares of our common stock. Equity-based awards under our employee compensation plans are made with newly issued shares reserved for this purpose. Stock Options The Company uses a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense as of each respective grant date. Generally, stock option grants vest ratably over four years, have a 10-year term, and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value as of the grant date. The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period.

Additionally, settlement shall occur within following the vesting of the RSUs and the participant shall be entitled to receive one share of Class A common stock for each vested RSU. All other terms remained unchanged. As a result of the RSU Amendment, the estimated fair value of the modified awards was million and are being recognized as expense over the vesting period subsequent to the performance condition being met.

and million of costs primarily related to employee termination expenses and costs to exit two of our third-party warehouse and distribution facilities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These amounts are included under restructuring in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Additional restructuring charges or cash expenditures may be incurred as the Company makes further progress on this Productivity Initiative, which we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2025. As of September 30, 2024 , accrued restructuring costs of less than million are included under accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. These expenses are expected to be substantially paid by the end of 2024. 

 and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax computed by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of to income before provision of income taxes due to Zevia LLC s pass-through structure for U.S. income tax purposes, pass-through permanent differences, state franchise taxes, tax effects of stock-based compensation, and the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. Except for state franchise taxes, Zevia PBC did not recognize an income tax expense (benefit) on its share of pre-tax book loss, exclusive of the noncontrolling interest of , due to the full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets DTAs ). Tax Receivable Agreement The Company expects to obtain an increase in its share of tax basis in the net assets of Zevia LLC when Class B units are exchanged by the holders of Class B units for shares of Class A common stock of the Company and upon certain qualifying transactions. Each change in outstanding shares of Class A common stock of the Company results in a corresponding change in the Company's ownership of Class A units of Zevia LLC. The Company intends to treat any exchanges of Class B units as direct purchases of LLC interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amounts that Zevia PBC would otherwise pay in the future to various taxing authorities. They may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement TRA with continuing members of Zevia LLC and the shareholders of blocker companies Blocker Companies of certain pre-IPO institutional investors the Direct Zevia Stockholders ). In the event that such parties exchange any or all of their Class B units for Class A common stock, the TRA requires the Company to make payments to such holders for of the tax benefits realized, or in some cases deemed to be realized, by the Company by such exchange as a result of (i) certain favorable tax attributes acquired from the Blocker Companies in certain mergers (including net operating losses and the Blocker Companies allocable share of existing tax basis), (ii) increases in tax basis resulting from Zevia PBC s acquisition of continuing member s Zevia LLC units in connection with the IPO and in future exchanges and, (iii) tax basis increases attributable to payments made under the TRA (including tax benefits related to imputed interest). The annual tax benefits are computed by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such benefits. The Company expects to benefit from the remaining 15 of any tax benefits that it may actually realize. The TRA payments are not conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in Zevia LLC or the Company. To the extent that the Company is unable to timely make payments under the TRA for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. The timing and amount of aggregate payments due under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income the Company generates each year and the tax rate then applicable. The Company calculates the liability under the TRA using a complex TRA model, which includes an assumption related to the fair market value of assets. Payments are generally due under the TRA within a specified period of time following the filing of the Company s tax return for the taxable year with respect to which the payment obligation arises, although interest on such payments will begin to accrue at a rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 300 basis points from the due date (without extensions) of such tax return. The TRA provides that if (i) certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations, or other changes of control were to occur; (ii) there is a material uncured breach of any obligations under the TRA; or (iii) the Company elects an early termination of the TRA, then the TRA will terminate and the Company s obligations, or the Company s successor s obligations, under the TRA will accelerate and become due and payable, based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that the Company would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the TRA and that any Class B units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the fair market value of the Company s Class A common stock at the time of termination. 

 18 

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in the TRA liability is primarily related to Class B to Class A exchanges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. If utilization of the DTAs subject to the TRA becomes more likely than not in the future, the Company will record a liability related to the TRA, which will be recognized as an expense within its condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss .

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and other sections of this Quarterly Report and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report. The financial data discussed below reflects the historical results of operations and financial position of the Company. References in this Quarterly Report to Zevia, the Company, we, us, and our refer (1) prior to the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions, to Zevia LLC, and (2) after the consummation of the Reorganization Transactions, to Zevia PBC and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. 
 Overview 
 We are a better-for-you beverage company that develops, markets, sells, and distributes great tasting, zero sugar beverages made with simple, plant-based ingredients. We are a Delaware public benefit corporation and have been designated as a Certified B Corporation, and are focused on addressing the global health challenges resulting from excess sugar consumption by offering a broad portfolio of zero sugar, zero calorie, naturally sweetened beverages. All Zevia beverages are Non-GMO Project verified, gluten-free, Kosher, and vegan and include a variety of flavors across Soda, Energy Drinks, Organic Tea, and Kids drinks. Our products are distributed and sold principally across the U.S. and Canada through a diverse network of major retailers in the grocery, drug, warehouse club, mass, natural, convenience and e-commerce channels and in grocery and natural product stores and specialty outlets. The Company s products are manufactured and maintained at third-party beverage production and warehousing facilities located in both the U.S. and Canada. We believe that consumers increasingly select beverage products based on taste, ingredients and fit with today s consumer preferences, which has benefited the Zevia brand and resulted in over 2.1 billion cans of Zevia sold to date. 
 Key Events During the Third Quarter of 2024 
 Productivity Initiative 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we began executing a multi-year, broad-based Productivity Initiative designed to realign our cost structure in order to accelerate our route-to-market evolution and continue to build the Zevia Brand. This Productivity Initiative is designed to focus on our most critical initiatives including driving growth and innovation in our highest margin carbonated better-for-you beverages, re-align our cost structure to support greater investments in the Zevia Brand and improve operational excellence while simplifying processes across the organization. 
 The Productivity Initiative has resulted in the following: 
 Costs associated with the Productivity Initiative, including restructuring costs, were 0.1 and 1.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily includes employee related severance costs as well as costs related to exiting two of our third-party warehouse and distribution facilities. 

The Productivity Initiative is now expected to result in estimated annualized benefits of approximately 15.0 million, and we began seeing these benefits in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2024, and expect the savings to be more fully realized over the next 3-5 quarters. These benefits include reduction in costs of goods sold and reduction in operating expenses. We expect to reinvest the majority of these costs in brand marketing and our Direct Store Delivery strategy to drive future growth. 

Additional restructuring charges or cash expenditures may be incurred as the Company makes further progress on this Productivity Initiative, which we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2025. 
 NYSE Notice 
 The Company previously received a noncompliance notice from the New York Stock Exchange NYSE on June 26, 2024, because the average closing price of the Company s Class A common stock had been less than 1.00 per share over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. On September 30, 2024, the Company s Class A common stock closed above 1.00 and had an average closing share price of at least 1.00 over the prior 30 trading-day period. On October 1, 2024, the Company regained compliance with the minimum stock price continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 A number of external factors, including the global economy, global health emergencies, inflationary pressures, relatively high interest rates, volatility in the financial markets, recession fears, financial institution instability, any potential shutdown of the U.S. government, global hostilities, including the military conflicts in Ukraine and Israel and the surrounding areas, and political tensions between the U.S. and China, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation, labor, and commodity costs. These pressures have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact our margins and operating results. We, along with our competitors, have increased pricing on a number of products in response to widespread inflation. These pricing increases may result in future reductions in volume. 
 The following summarizes the components of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Net Sales 
 We generate net sales from the sales of our products, including Soda, Energy Drinks, Organic Tea, and Kids drinks, to our customers, which include grocery distributors, national retailers, convenience retailers, natural products retailers, warehouse club retailers and retailers with e-commerce channels, in the U.S. and Canada. 
 20 

We offer our customers sales incentives that are designed to support the distribution of our products to consumers. These incentives include discounts, trade promotions, price allowances and product placement fees. The amounts for these incentives are deducted from gross sales to arrive at our net sales. 
 The following factors and trends in our business are expected to be key drivers of our net sales for the foreseeable future: 
 leveraging our platform and mission to grow brand awareness, increase velocity and expand our consumer base; 

continuing to grow our strong relationships across our retailer network and retain and expand distribution amongst new and existing channels, both in-store and online; and 

continuous innovation efforts, enhancement of existing products, and introduction of additional flavors within existing categories, as well as entering into new categories. 

We expect our future growth to be driven by a combination of new distribution, increased organic sales from existing outlets, package and product innovation, and continued pricing strength; however, sales levels in any given period may continue to be impacted by seasonality, increased level of competition, customers efforts to manage inventory, and our ability to fulfill customer demands. During 2024, we experienced reduced sales volumes, primarily due to lost distribution at certain retailers, largely in the club channel and one customer in the mass channel, and to a lesser degree as a result of a strategic decision we made to exit our Kids and Mixers product categories to focus on soda. We also increased our spend on promotional activity at key accounts, returning back to historical promotion levels, in order to drive velocity, which we expect to continue through the end of the year and in 2025. We also increased promotions in order to liquidate excess and obsolete inventory, which we expect to be temporary and complete by the end of 2024. We are focused on building distribution in our key accounts and concurrently evolving our route-to-market; however we expect it will take time to regain lost distribution in an increasingly competitive environment. 
 We sell our products in the U.S. and Canada, direct to retailers and also through distributors. We do not have short- or long-term sales commitments with our customers. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Historically, cost of goods sold consists of all costs to acquire and manufacture our products, including the cost of ingredients, raw materials, packaging, in-bound freight and logistics and third-party production fees. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, our contract manufacturers are responsible for the procurement of raw materials to produce our products, which are then sold to us as finished goods; therefore, cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 consists of all costs to purchase our product from our contract manufacturers as a finished good. 
 Our cost of goods sold is subject to price fluctuations in the marketplace, particularly in the price of aluminum and other raw materials, as well as in the cost of production, packaging, in-bound freight and logistics. Our results of operations depend on our contract manufacturers ability to arrange for the purchase of raw materials and the production of our products in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have long-term contracts with certain suppliers of stevia and certain third-party contract manufacturers governing quality control, regulatory compliance, pricing and other terms, but these contracts generally do not guarantee any minimum purchase commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers. Our third-party contract manufacturers procure packaging and ingredient materials to manufacture our products according to our submitted rolling forecasts, with the initial three months of each forecast generally constituting our purchase commitment. 
 We expect our cost of goods sold to increase in absolute dollars as our volume increases, but decrease over time as a percentage of net sales as a result of the Productivity Initiative, our continued focus on cost and efficiency improvements, and as we realize the benefit of scale. 
 We elected to classify shipping and handling costs for salable product outside of cost of goods sold, in selling and marketing expenses in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As a result, our gross profit and profit margin may not be comparable to other entities that present shipping and handling costs as a component of cost of goods sold. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit consists of our net sales less costs of goods sold. Our gross profit and gross margin are affected by the mix of distribution channels of our net sales in each period, as well as the level of discounts and promotions offered during the period. Gross profit may be favorably impacted by leveraging our asset-light business model and through increased distribution direct to retailers, the increased scale of our business, our Productivity Initiative, and our continued focus on cost and efficiency improvements. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of warehousing and distribution costs and advertising and marketing expenses. Warehousing and distribution costs include storage, transfer, repacking and handling fees and out-bound freight and delivery charges. Advertising and marketing expenses consist of variable costs associated with production and media buying of marketing programs and trade events, as well as sampling and in-store demonstration costs. Selling and marketing expenses also include the incremental costs of obtaining contracts, such as sales commissions. 
 Our selling expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars in the long-term as a result of increased warehousing and distribution costs driven by increased net sales, but decrease as a percentage of sales over time as a result of our Productivity Initiative and our continued focus on cost improvements in our supply chain. Our selling expenses are expected to decrease from the prior year in the short-term, largely due to a decrease in logistics expenses compared to the prior year as a result of the historical supply chain logistics challenges encountered during 2023 as well as due to the Productivity Initiative. 
 Marketing expenses are expected to increase as we invest in in brand awareness, which are expected to be partially funded by the selling expense cost savings and Productivity Initiative. 
 21 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include all salary and other personnel expenses (other than equity-based compensation expense) for our employees, including employees related to management, marketing, sales, product development, quality control, accounting, information technology and other functions. Our ongoing general and administrative expenses are expected to remain flat in absolute dollars in the near term and as a percentage of net sales over time. 
 Equity-Based Compensation Expenses 
 Equity-based compensation expense consists of the recorded expense of equity-based compensation for our employees and, if any, for certain consultants and service providers who are non-employees. We record equity-based compensation expense for employee grants using grant date fair value for RSUs or a Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options by date granted. Equity-based compensation cost for RSU awards is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Zevia LLC Class B unit or the Zevia PBC Class A common stock, as applicable, on the date of grant. Our equity-based compensation expense is expected to remain relatively consistent in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of net sales over time. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation is primarily related to computer equipment, quality control and marketing equipment, and leasehold improvements. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist of customer relationships and software applications. Non-amortizable intangible assets consist of trademarks, which represent the Company s exclusive ownership of the Zevia brand used in connection with the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of its beverages. We also own several other trademarks in both the U.S. and in foreign countries. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to increase in-line with ongoing capital expenditures as our business grows. 
 Restructuring Expenses 
 Restructuring expenses include employee severance and benefit costs to terminate a specified number of employees as well as costs to exit two of our third-party warehouse and distribution facilities designed to reduce costs and improve efficiency while continuing to invest in our brand and related initiatives. Additional restructuring charges or cash expenditures may be incurred as the Company makes further progress on the Productivity Initiative, which we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2025. 
 Other income, net 
 Other income, net consists primarily of interest income (expense), and foreign currency (loss) gains.

Equivalized cases sold were 2.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decrease in the number of equivalized cases sold, which resulted in 6.3 million lower net sales and was largely caused by the expected lost distribution in our club channel and one customer in our mass channel, and a decrease in net sales of 0.4 million resulting from greater promotional levels at retailers as well as increased promotions in order to liquidate excess and obsolete inventory.

Equivalized cases sold were 8.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 9.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a decrease in the number of equivalized cases sold, which resulted in 13.9 million lower net sales and was largely caused by lost distribution in our club channel and one customer in our mass channel, partially offset by pricing increases of 0.8 million, which is inclusive of greater promotional levels at retailers as well as increased promotions in order to liquidate excess and obsolete inventory. We define an equivalized case as a 288 fluid ounce case.

Seasonality 
 Generally, we experience greater demand for our products during the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. As our business continues to grow, we expect to see continued seasonality effects, with net sales tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 32.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, together with our operating activities and available borrowings under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit (as defined below), will provide adequate liquidity for ongoing operations, planned capital expenditures and other investments beyond the next 12 months. 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from sales of our products, and borrowing capacity currently available under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. Our primary cash needs are for operating expenses, working capital, and capital expenditures to support the growth in our business. 
 Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, gross margin and the level of expenditures in all areas of the Company. In future years, we may experience an increase in operating and capital expenditures from time to time, as needed, as we expand business activities. To the extent that existing capital resources and sales growth are not sufficient to fund future activities, we may seek alternative financing through additional equity or debt financing transactions. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Also, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs in light of current and future global health emergencies, inflationary pressures, relatively high interest rates, volatility in the financial markets, recession fears, financial institution instability, any potential shutdown of the U.S. government, current and future global hostilities, and political tensions between the U.S. and China that may continue to disrupt and impact the global and national economies and global financial markets. If any disruption continues into the future, we may not be able to access the financial markets and could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could negatively affect our operations in the future. Failure to raise additional capital, if and when needed, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 The Company is a holding company, and is the sole managing member of Zevia LLC. The Company operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Zevia LLC. Accordingly, the Company is dependent on distributions from Zevia LLC to pay its taxes, its obligations under the TRA and other expenses. Any future credit facilities may impose limitations on the ability of Zevia LLC to pay dividends to the Company. 
 In connection with the IPO and the Reorganization Transactions in July 2021, the Direct Zevia Stockholders and certain continuing members of Zevia LLC received the right to receive future payments pursuant to the TRA. The amount payable under the TRA will be based on an annual calculation of the reduction in our U.S. federal, state and local taxes resulting from the utilization of certain pre-IPO tax attributes and tax benefits resulting from sales and exchanges by continuing members of Zevia LLC. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions Tax Receivable Agreement included in the prospectus dated July 21, 2021 and filed with the SEC on July 23, 2021. We expect that the payments that we may be required to make under the TRA may be substantial. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the TRA, we expect that the reduction in tax payments for us associated with the federal, state and local tax benefits described above would aggregate to approximately 66.3 million through 2037. Under such scenario we would be required to pay the Direct Zevia Stockholders and certain continuing members of Zevia LLC 85 of such amount, or 56.4 million, through 2037. 
 The actual amounts may materially differ from these hypothetical amounts, as potential future reductions in tax payments for us and TRA payments by us will be calculated using prevailing tax rates applicable to us over the life of the TRA and will be dependent on us generating sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit. 
 We cannot reasonably estimate future annual payments under the TRA given the difficulty in determining those estimates as they are dependent on a number of factors, including the extent of exchanges by continuing Zevia LLC unitholders, the associated fair value of the underlying Zevia LLC units at the time of those exchanges, the tax rates applicable, our future income, and the associated tax benefits that might be realized that would trigger a TRA payment requirement. 
 However, a significant portion of any potential future payments under the TRA is anticipated to be payable over 15 years, consistent with the period over which the associated tax deductions would be realized by us, assuming Zevia LLC generates sufficient income to utilize the deductions. If sufficient income is not generated by Zevia LLC, the associated taxable income of Zevia will be impacted and the associated tax benefits to be realized will be limited, thereby similarly reducing the associated TRA payments to be made. Given the length of time over which payments would be payable, the impact to liquidity in any single year is greatly reduced. 
 Although the timing and extent of future payments could vary significantly under the TRA for the factors discussed above, we anticipate funding payments from the TRA from cash flows generated from operations.

Credit Facility 
 ABL Credit Facility 
 On February 22, 2022, we obtained a revolving credit facility (the Secured Revolving Line of Credit by entering into a Loan and Security Agreement with Bank of America, N.A (the Loan and Security Agreement ). Under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit, we may draw funds up to an amount not to exceed the lesser of (i) a 20 million revolving commitment and (ii) a borrowing base which is comprised of inventory and receivables. Up to 2 million of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be used for letter of credit issuances with the option to increase the commitment under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit by up to 10 million, subject to certain conditions. The Secured Revolving Line of Credit matures on February 22, 2027. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company drew 8 million on the Secured Revolving Line of Credit which was subsequently repaid in the same period. As of September 30, 2024, there was no amount outstanding on the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The Secured Revolving Line of Credit is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets. 
 Loans under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit bear interest based on either, at our option, the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate plus an applicable margin between 1.50 to 2.00 or the Base Rate (customarily defined) plus an applicable margin between 0.50 to 1.00 with margin, in each case, determined by the average daily availability under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The Loan and Security Agreement was amended on September 30, 2024 to replace the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index, which will be discontinued on November 15, 2024, with the Term Secured Overnight Financing rate, effective November 20, 2024. 
 Under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit we must satisfy a financial covenant requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter following the occurrence of certain events of default that are continuing or any day on which availability under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit is less than the greater of 3 million and 17.5 of the borrowing base, and must again satisfy such financial covenant as of the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter until such time as there are no events of default and availability has been above such threshold for 30 consecutive days. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenant.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 
 Our cash flows provided by or used in operating activities are primarily influenced by working capital requirements. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a net increase in cash related to changes in operating assets and liabilities of 12.4 million. Changes in cash flows related to operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to a decrease in inventories of 13.9 million due to decreased production of inventory as inventory levels are managed, decreased prepaid expenses and other assets of 2.4 million largely due to a decrease in prepaid deposits related to the sale of raw materials, and a decrease in accounts receivable of 1.1 million due to timing of payments, partially offset by a net decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 4.6 million due to timing of purchases and decreased production of inventory. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash due to a net loss of 17.0 million, partially offset by non-cash expenses of 5.6 million primarily related to equity-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense. 
 Net cash used in operating activities of 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a net loss of 19.2 million, partially offset by non-cash expenses of 8.4 million primarily related to equity-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense and a net increase in cash related to changes in operating assets and liabilities of 1.1 million. Changes in cash flows related to operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase of 29.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities due to timing of purchases and increased production of inventory, partially offset by an increase in inventories of 21.8 million due to increased production of inventory as a result of the supply chain logistics challenges in the prior year, increase in accounts receivable of 5.3 million due to timing of invoices, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 0.5 million due to timing of prepayments. 
 Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to purchases of property, equipment, and software of 0.2 million for computer equipment, marketing fixtures, and software used in ongoing operations. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities of 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of its warehouse and related assets of 2.3 million, partially offset by purchases of property, equipment, and software of 1.6 million for leasehold improvements and computer equipment and software used in ongoing operations. 
 Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of less than 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to proceeds from the Secured Revolving Line of Credit of 8 million which was repaid in the same period. 
 27 

Net cash provided by financing activities of less than 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with additional useful information in evaluating our operating performance. 
 We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude: (1) other income, net, which includes interest (income) expense and foreign currency (gains) losses, (2) (benefit) provision for income taxes, (3) depreciation and amortization, (4) equity-based compensation, and (5) restructuring expenses (for 2024, in light of our Productivity Initiative). Also, Adjusted EBITDA may in the future be adjusted for amounts impacting net income related to the TRA liability and other infrequent and unusual transactions. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating performance and facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to our investors as it is a measure used by management in assessing the health of our business, determining incentive compensation and evaluating our operating performance, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include that (1) it does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future, (2) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these capital expenditures, (3) it does not consider the impact of equity-based compensation expense, including the potential dilutive impact thereof, and (4) it does not reflect other non-operating expenses, including interest (income) expense, foreign currency (gains)/losses, and restructuring. In addition, our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, when evaluating our performance, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial measures, including our net income (loss) and other results stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:

 Commitments 
 Effective March 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the lease for its corporate headquarters offices to extend the lease term through December 31, 2023 and expand the total square footage from 17,923 square feet to 20,185 square feet which commenced on May 1, 2022. In January 2023, the Company entered into another amendment to the lease and further extended the lease term through December 31, 2026. 
 Our leases generally consist of long-term operating leases, which are payable monthly and relate to our office space. For a further discussion on our debt and operating lease commitments as of September 30, 2024, see the sections above including Note 7, Debt , and Note 8, Leases , included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report. 
 Our inventory purchase commitments are generally short-term in nature and have ordinary commercial terms. We did not have any material long-term inventory purchase commitments as of September 30, 2024. Our contract manufacturers are obligated to fulfill against purchase orders that are aligned with our forecast based on terms and conditions of the contract. Our forecasts provided to our contract manufacturers are short term in nature and at no time extend beyond a year. 
 We expect to satisfy these commitments through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from sales of our products. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those discussed in our Annual Report. 
 28 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We may take advantage of these exemptions until such time we are no longer an emerging growth company. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of these exemptions up until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if any of the following events occur: (i) we have more than 1.235 billion in annual revenue, (ii) we have more than 700.0 million in market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates (and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one annual report on Form 10-K) or (iii) we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period. 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily consist of raw material and finished goods prices, foreign exchange, inflation and commodities as follows: 
 Raw Material and Finished Goods Risk 
 Our profitability is dependent on, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to raw material costs. Currently, a key ingredient in our products is stevia extract. Our stevia leaf extract is procured by our contract manufacturers and sourced from a large multi-national ingredient company with whom we have a long-standing relationship through a two-year agreement that was entered into effective October 15, 2023, which includes fixed pricing for the duration of the term. During 2023, we tested, qualified, and approved the use of another stevia leaf extract supplier, whose stevia leaf is derived from a region different than the above supplier, and we continue to seek to diversify to alternative sources of supply to mitigate potential supply disruptions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure alternative sources of supply. Additionally, the prices of stevia and other ingredients we use are subject to many factors beyond our control, such as market conditions, climate change, supply chain challenges, and adverse weather conditions. 
 Our aluminum cans are procured by our contract manufacturers through various can manufacturers. The price for aluminum cans also fluctuates depending on market conditions. Our contract manufacturers ability to continue to procure enough aluminum cans at reasonable prices will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. 
 We are seeking to diversify our sources of supply and intend to enter into arrangements to better ensure stability of prices of our raw materials. 
 Due to a change in supply chain processes during the first quarter of 2024, our contract manufacturers are now responsible for the procurement of raw materials to produce our products, which are then sold to us as finished goods. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had three vendors accounting for approximately 87 of our total raw material and finished goods purchases. Refer to Note 13, Major Customers, Accounts Receivable and Vendor Concentration , included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 The majority of our sales and costs are denominated in U.S. dollars and are not subject to foreign exchange risk. Our contract manufacturers source some ingredients and packaging materials from international sources, and as a result our results of operations could be impacted by changes in exchange rates. We sell and distribute our products to Canadian customers, who are invoiced and remit payment in Canadian dollars. All Canadian dollar transactions are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for sales and expenses. To the extent our contract manufacturers increase sourcing from outside the U.S. or we increase net sales outside of the U.S. that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the impact of changes in exchange rates on our results of operations would increase. Foreign exchange gains and losses were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If our costs were to become subject to further and prolonged significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Commodity Risk 
 We are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. Our principal commodities risks relate to purchases of aluminum, diesel fuel, cartons and corrugate. 
 29 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES . 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the foregoing evaluation, management determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management determined that as of September 30, 2024, no changes in our internal control over financial reporting had occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 	(ii)	Interest on each Term SOFR Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified in the Agreement; provided , that any prepayment of any Term SOFR Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to the Breakage Provisions. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any debtor relief law. 

(e) 	 Computations . All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to Term SOFR) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest with respect to Term SOFR Loans shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to the provisions in the Agreement addressing payments generally, bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
 (f)	 Successor Rates . The provisions in the Loan Documents addressing the replacement of a current Successor Rate for Dollars shall be deemed to apply to Term SOFR Loans and Term SOFR, as applicable, and the related defined terms shall be deemed to include Dollars and Term SOFR, as applicable.
