Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Going Concern Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of 8,771,833; however, this was largely due to the transaction cost incurred with our recent acquisition. We had net cash used in operating activities of 165,094 and an accumulated deficit of 26,332,520. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of this filing. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate profitable operations in the future. Management plans to provide for the Company s capital requirements by continuing to issue additional equity and debt securities. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, the Company will have sufficient funds to execute its business plan or generate positive operating results. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Critical Accounting Policies Refer to Note 2 for a condensed discussion of our critical accounting policies and to our Form K, which includes our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a full discussion of our critical accounting policies. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 3.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management believes the financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 19 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 1.
