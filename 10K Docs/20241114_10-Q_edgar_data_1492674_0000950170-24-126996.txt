 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLID ATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 
 million, an accumulated deficit of million , stockholders deficit of million, and has experienced cash outflows from operating activities since its inception. The future success of the Company is dependent on its ability to successfully commercialize its products, obtain regulatory clearance for and successfully launch its future product candidates, obtain additional capital and ultimately attain profitable operations. Historically, the Company has funded its operations primarily through public equity and private debt financings, including the Company's August 2014 initial public offering, the December 2015 public offering, the September 2016 private investment in public equity PIPE financing, the September 2017 public offering, the June 2018 public offering, the July 2019 establishment of an equity distribution agreement and equity purchase agreement, the March 2021 establishment of the Equity Distribution Agreement (Note 9), the February 2023 public offering (Note 8), the May 2024 private offering (Note 8), the July 2024 establishment of the Wainwright Equity Distribution Agreement (Note 9), private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and through debt financing arrangements. The Company believes its cash position is insufficient to fund future operations without financings during the fourth quarter of 2024, which may include public or private equity or debt financings. These financings may not be successful, however, or on terms favorable to the Company or its stockholders, which would have a negative impact on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and the Company s ability to develop and commercialize its products and ultimately operate as a going concern. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other early commercial stage life science companies, including, but not limited to commercially launching the Company s products, development and market acceptance of the Company s product candidates, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, and raising additional capital. In September 2023, the Company s milestone-based product development contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA (Note 12) expired, which may impact the Company s ability to continue to fund the development of its next-generation products. The Company s T2Dx Instrument and T2Candida, T2Bacteria, and the T2Biothreat Panels are authorized for use in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ). Pursuant to the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ASC 205-40 ), management must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 

 7 

million on September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to fund its current operating plan for at least 12 months from issuance of these financial statements, as certain elements of its operating plan cannot be considered probable. Absent any reductions in current operating expenses, the Company believes it will require additional financing during the fourth quarter of 2024, which may include public or private equity or debt financings. Under ASC 205-40, the future receipt of potential funding from co-development partners and other resources cannot be considered probable at this time because none of the plans are entirely within the Company s control. The Company's Term Loan Agreement (the Term Loan Agreement with certain entities managed by CR Group L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (each entity, a CRG entity and collectively, CRG (Note 6) has a minimum liquidity covenant, which initially required the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance of million. In May 2023, CRG reduced the minimum liquidity covenant under the Term Loan Agreement from million to until December 31, 2023. In July 2023, April 2024, and May 2024, the Company converted million, million, and million, respectively, of the outstanding debt principal with CRG to equity. In October 2023, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend both the interest-only period and the maturity date by from to , and permanently reduce the minimum liquidity covenant from million to . Unless the Company raises additional funds, management believes it is probable that the Company will not be able to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant. On March 30, 2023, the Company received notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, for the last thirty consecutive business days, the bid price for the Company s common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 555(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price Rule ). On May 23, 2023, Nasdaq notified the Company that its securities were subject to delisting due to non-compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule and to maintain a minimum value of listed securities (the MVLS Rule of at least million. The Company requested a hearing with Nasdaq and, on July 6, 2023, appealed to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel for an extension to the time period in which to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule and the Minimum Bid Price Rule. On July 26, 2023, we filed a definitive proxy statement to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock in connection with our annual meeting that occurred in September 2023 as required by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. On August 9, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it had regained compliance with the MVLS Rule. On September 15, 2023, at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s restated certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock. On October 12, 2023, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved the reverse stock split at the ratio of 1 post-split share for every pre-split shares, which was effective as of October 12, 2023. On October 31, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. The Company was subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Company failed to comply with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, the Company would not be permitted additional time to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. However, the Company would have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Hearing Panel prior to the Company s securities being delisted from Nasdaq. On November 20, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it no longer satisfied the MVLS Rule. In accordance with the terms of the Mandatory Panel Monitor, the Company was not granted a grace period but rather issued a delist determination. The Company exercised its right to appeal by requesting a hearing and paying a non-refundable fee, which stayed any further action by Nasdaq pending the issuance of its decision and the expiration of any extension that may be granted to the Company as a result of the hearing. The Company s common stock remained listed and eligible to trade on Nasdaq pending the outcome of the hearing. On February 15, 2024, the Company appealed to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel for an extension to the time period in which to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule. On March 11, 2024, the Company received notice from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it had granted the Company s request for continued listing on Nasdaq, subject to the Company demonstrating compliance with Nasdaq s MVLS Rule on or before May 20, 2024. On May 21, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it has regained compliance with the MVLS Rule for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

 8 

million required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) for the previous consecutive trading days. In accordance with the terms of the previously imposed Mandatory Panel Monitor as that term is defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff did not grant the Company a grace period but rather issued a delist determination, which will be stayed if the Company exercises its right to appeal the determination by requesting a hearing and paying a non-refundable fee. Subsequently, the Company paid the non-refundable fee and plans to request a hearing, which will stay any further action by Nasdaq at least pending the issuance of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel s decision and the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to the Company as a result of the hearing. The Company s common stock will remain listed and eligible to trade on Nasdaq pending the outcome of the hearing. There can be no assurance, however, that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel will grant the Company s request for continued listing or that the Company will evidence compliance with all applicable listing criteria prior to the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Panel to do so. These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management's plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include raising additional funding, delaying certain research projects and capital expenditures, and eliminating certain future operating expenses in order to fund operations at reduced levels for the Company to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. Management has concluded the likelihood that its plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources or maintain reduced expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.

shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock on July 3, 2023 and shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on April 12, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 , shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock remain issued and outstanding. The Company reviewed the terms of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and noted that such stock had preferential rights and that the liquidation preference for each would be on parity with that of the Company s common shares. Because the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock had the same level of subordination and, in substance, the same characteristics as the Company s common shares, the Company included the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, on an if-converted basis, in the basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders calculation for all periods in which the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock remained issued and outstanding. The Company has also issued certain securities that are participating securities. Therefore, the Company must apply the two-class method to determine basic and diluted earnings per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation method under which net loss per share is calculated for each class of common stock and participating security considering both dividends declared, if any, and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed for the period. The Company s participating securities do not have an obligation to share in the losses of the Company; therefore, to the extent that the Company remains in a net loss position, the entire net loss will be allocated to common stockholders. Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, in-substance common stock, and potential common shares exercisable for little to no consideration, and does not consider other common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted-average number of shares outstanding, in-substance common stock, and potential common shares exercisable for little to no consideration used to compute basic earnings per share for the dilutive effect of other common stock equivalents that were outstanding during the period, determined using either the if-converted method or the treasury-stock method.

payment terms in the U.S. and net payment terms internationally. Most of the Company s contracts with distributors in geographic regions outside the United States contain only a single performance obligation, whereas most of the Company s contracts with direct sales customers in the United States contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Excluded from the transaction price are sales tax and other similar taxes which are presented on a net basis. Product revenue is generated by the sale of instruments and consumable diagnostic tests predominantly through the Company s direct sales force in the United States and distributors in geographic regions outside the United States. The Company generally does not offer product returns or exchange rights (other than those relating to defective goods under warranty) or price protection allowances to its customers, including its distributors. Payment terms granted to distributors are the same as those granted to end-user customers and payments are not dependent upon the distributors receipt of payment from their end-user customers. The Company either sells instruments to customers and international distributors or retains title and places the instrument at the customer site pursuant to a reagent rental agreement. When an instrument is purchased by a customer or international distributor, the

Maintenance Services are separate performance obligations as they are service based warranties and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the service delivery period. After the completion of the initial Maintenance Services period, customers have the option to renew or extend the Maintenance Services typically for additional periods in exchange for additional consideration. The extended Maintenance Services are also service based warranties that represent separate purchasing decisions. The Company recognizes revenue allocated to the extended Maintenance Services performance obligation on a straight-line basis over the service delivery period. Fees paid to member-owned group purchasing organizations GPOs are deducted from related product revenues. The Company warrants that consumable diagnostic tests will be free from defects, when handled according to product specifications, for the stated life of the product. To fulfill valid warranty claims, the Company provides replacement product free of charge. Warranty expense is recognized based on the estimated defect rates of the consumable diagnostic tests. Contribution Revenue The government contract with BARDA was considered a government grant and not considered a contract with a customer and thus not subject to ASC 606. Revenue under the government BARDA contract was earned under a cost-sharing arrangement in which the Company was reimbursed for direct costs incurred plus allowable indirect costs. The government contract revenue was recognized as the related reimbursable expenses were incurred. The cost reimbursement that was reported as revenue was presented gross of the related reimbursable expenses in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations; the related reimbursable expenses were expensed as incurred as research and development expense. The Company accounted for these contracts as a government grant by analogy to International Accounting Standards 20 IAS 20 ), Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance . The BARDA contract expired in September 2023.

Remaining Performance Obligations Under ASC 606, the Company is required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price that is allocated to unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2024 . However, the guidance provides certain practical expedients that limit this requirement, and therefore, the Company has elected to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. The nature of the excluded unsatisfied performance obligations pursuant to the practical expedient include consumable shipments, service contracts, warranties and installation services that will be performed within . The amount of the transaction price that is allocated to unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations, that has not yet been recognized as revenue and that does not meet the elected practical expedient is million as of September 30, 2024 . of this amount as revenue within and the remainder within . Judgments Certain contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once the performance obligations are determined, the Company determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration, based on the most likely amount, to be included in the transaction price, if any. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative standalone selling price method. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied as discussed in the revenue categories above. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. The Company determines standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as a range of selling prices, market conditions and the expected costs and margin related to the performance obligations. Contract Assets and Liabilities The Company's contract assets represent revenue recognized for performance obligations in advance of invoicing at the contract level based on the transaction price allocated to the respective performance obligations. The opening and closing balances of the Company's contract assets were million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company s contract liabilities consist of upfront payments for maintenance services on instrument sales. Contract liabilities are classified in deferred revenue as current or non-current based on the timing of when revenue is expected to be recognized. The opening and closing balances of the Company's contract liabilities were million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relating to contract liabilities on December 31, 2023 was million and related to straight-line revenue recognition associated with maintenance agreements.

The Company is required to disclose the fair value and the level within the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For certain financial instruments, including accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 because of their short-term nature. Cash and cash equivalents were classified as Level 1 and all other financial instruments were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company used Level 3 inputs to measure the fair value of the derivative liability related to the Term Loan Agreement with related party. Based on these measurements, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Term Loan Agreement approximates its fair value on September 30, 2024 .

Construction in progress is primarily comprised of equipment that has not been placed in service. T2-owned instruments and components is primarily comprised of instruments that will be used for internal research and development, clinical studies and reagent rental agreement with customers. Depreciation expense, a component of cost of product revenue, from instruments under the T2-owned reagent rental pool was million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Depreciation expense, a component of cost of product revenue, from instruments under the T2-owned reagent rental pool was million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total depreciation expense for T2-owned instruments used for internal research and development and clinical studies is recorded as a component of research and development expense. Depreciation and amortization expense of million and million was charged to operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense of million and million was charged to operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we determined a triggering event occurred that required us to evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment. The triggering event was the reassessment of the Company s sales demand forecast. We evaluated our long-lived assets by our two asset groups, which are T2-owned assets that are placed at customer sites as rental instruments and all other assets which support the Company s product research and manufacturing. As a result of the evaluation, the Company recorded impairment charges for T2-owned non-lease instruments and reagent manufacturing assets. T2-owned non-lease instruments were evaluated based on average historical sale prices for refurbished instruments. Reagent manufacturing assets were evaluated based on estimated cash flows from projected reagent test sales using historical margins and commission rates. The Company recorded a total loss on impairment of property and equipment of million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

million under the Term Loan Agreement and had the ability to borrow an additional million upon receiving specified clearance for the marketing of T2Bacteria by April 30, 2018 (the Approval Milestone ). The Company agreed to pay (1) a financing fee based on the amount of principal drawn and (2) a final payment fee based on the principal outstanding upon repayment. The debt discount related to the financing fee and the fees paid to CRG are being amortized over the loan term as interest expense. Interest expense for the debt discount was less than million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and was million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The final payment fee is accrued as interest expense and is classified consistent with the classification of the Term Loan. The effective interest rate of the Term Loan was as of September 30, 2024. The Term Loan s principal is prepayable at any time partially or in full without a prepayment penalty. Borrowings are collateralized by a lien on substantially all Company assets, including intellectual property. The Term Loan Agreement provides for affirmative and negative covenants, and originally included a requirement to maintain a minimum cash balance of million. The Term Loan Agreement includes a subjective acceleration clause whereby an event of default, including a material adverse change in the business, operations, or conditions (financial or otherwise), could result, at CRG s discretion, in the acceleration of the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate of an additional per annum may apply, at CRG s discretion, on all outstanding obligations during the occurrence and continuance of an event of default. The Term Loan originally had a term, with three years of interest-only payments accruing at a fixed rate of , of which could be paid in-kind by increasing the principal balance. After achievement of the Approval Milestone, such rates would be reduced and a fourth year of interest-only payments would be granted, after which quarterly payments of principal and interest would be owed through the December 30, 2022 maturity date. Upon achievement of certain performance metrics, the loan would be converted to interest-only until its maturity, at which time all unpaid principal and interest would be due and payable. In connection with the Term Loan Agreement, the Company issued warrants to CRG to purchase a total of shares of the Company s common stock, exercisable any time prior to December 30, 2026. Amendments The Term Loan Agreement has been amended eleven times as of September 30, 2024. As a result of those amendments, certain terms of the Term Loan have been revised as follows: In 2018, upon the Company s achievement of the Approval Milestone, interest on borrowings began accruing at per year, of which is payable in cash quarterly and of which is deferred and added to principal until maturity. 

 In 2019: 

 The final payment fee was increased from to of the principal outstanding upon repayment. 

 The Company issued additional warrants to CRG to purchase shares of its common stock, exercisable any time prior to September 9, 2029 at an exercise price of per share, with provisions for termination upon a change of control or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (these warrants, along with the warrants to purchase shares of common stock previously issued to CRG, are collectively referred to as the CRG Warrants ).

. 

 In 2022, the principal maturity date was extended to December 30, 2024, and the Term Loan s interest-only payment period was extended until that maturity date. 

 In 2023: 

 The Company and CRG entered into a waiver and consent that reduced the minimum liquidity covenant to until .

 In July 2023, CRG canceled million of the Term Loan s principal in exchange for shares of common stock and shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. In connection with the principal cancelation, CRG waived the final payment fees associated with the canceled principal. 

 In October 2023, the interest-only period and maturity of the Term Loan were extended to December 31, 2025 and the liquidity covenant was made permanent. 

 In 2024: 

 In April 2024, CRG canceled million of the Term Loan's principal in exchange for shares of common stock and shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In connection with the principal cancelation, CRG waived the final payment fees associated with the canceled principal. In addition, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend the period in which the Company may elect to pay a portion of the accrued paid-in-kind interest to the earlier of (a) December 31, 2025 and (b) the date on which a default has occurred. 

 In May 2024, CRG canceled million of the Term Loan's principal in exchange for shares of common stock. In connection with the principal cancelation, CRG waived the final payment fees associated with the canceled principal. In addition, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to allow CRG or their affiliates to acquire a majority of shares in the Company without causing a change of control as defined under the Term Loan Agreement. 

 The warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock remain outstanding on September 30, 2024. There were no covenant violations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Amendments made in February 2022, November 2022, October 2023, and the partial principal cancellations in July 2023, April 2024, and May 2024 were accounted for as troubled debt restructurings. For all restructurings, at the time of the restructuring the future undiscounted cash outflows required under the amended agreement exceeded the carrying value of the debt and no gain was recognized as a result of the restructurings. The effects of each restructuring were accounted for prospectively. Related Party Transactions Upon the close of the July 2023 transaction in which CRG canceled million of the Term Loan s principal in exchange for shares of common stock and shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, CRG became a holder of more than percent of our common stock outstanding, and therefore determined to be a principal owner and related party. As of December 31, 2023 , CRG held shares of common stock and shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, which was convertible into more than percent of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023 . In February 2024, CRG converted shares of its Series B Preferred Stock into shares of common stock, which represented more than percent of our common stock outstanding. In April 2024 and May 2024, CRG canceled an aggregate of million of the Term Loan's principal in exchange for an aggregate of shares of common stock and shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In connection with the principal cancelation, CRG waived the final payment fees associated with the canceled principal. In May 2024, CRG converted all of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and remaining Series B Convertible Preferred Stock into an aggregate of shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, CRG held shares of common stock which represented approximately of our common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Classification The Term Loan Agreement with CRG was classified as a current liability on both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . In May 2023, the Company received a modification and waiver reducing the Term Loan s minimum cash covenant from million to until December 31, 2023. In addition, in October 2023, the interest-only period and maturity of the Term Loan were 

 21 

, and the liquidity covenant was made permanent. Because management believes it is probable that the Company will not be able to comply with the covenant unless additional funds are raised, the Company concluded that the Term Loan and related liabilities should be classified as current on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock was redeemed. The Series A Warrant became exercisable on and expires on . The Series A Warrant contains certain anti-dilution provisions to protect the holder. On February 17, 2023, the Company issued and sold shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock and warrants to purchase common stock to an underwriter pursuant to an underwriting agreement (see discussion below). The terms of that offering triggered an adjustment to the exercise price of the Series A Warrant to effective as of February 17, 2023. The Company is required to measure the Series A Warrant at fair value at inception and in subsequent reporting periods with changes in fair value recognized in change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the period of change in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the liability related to the Series A Warrant at inception was million. The Series A Warrant was not exercised as of September 30, 2024 and remains outstanding. The change in fair value during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was immaterial. February 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants and Common Stock Warrants On February 17, 2023, the Company sold shares of par value common stock, Pre-Funded Warrants and Common Stock Warrants through an offering underwritten by Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC.

The combined purchase price for each share and accompanying Common Stock Warrant is , and for each 

 24 

, which was equal to the combined purchase price for each share and accompanying Common Stock Warrant sold in the offering, minus the Pre-Funded Warrant s exercise price per share of . The total proceeds of million from the February 17, 2023 offering were allocated between the common stock, Pre-Funded Warrants and Common Stock Warrants. Because the Common Stock Warrants are liability-classified, an amount of proceeds equal to the fair value of the liability were first allocated to the Common Stock Warrants. The remaining proceeds were allocated on a relative fair value basis to the common stock and the Pre-Funded Warrants and recognized in additional paid-in capital. Total issuance costs related to the offering of million were allocated in a similar manner as the total proceeds. As a result, approximately million of issuance costs were expensed at the issuance date and recognized as Other, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The remaining issuance costs were recognized within additional paid-in-capital as a reduction to the proceeds received for the common stock and Pre-Funded Warrants. The Pre-Funded Warrants had (i) an exercise price per share of common stock equal to or (ii) a cashless exercise option, with the number of shares received determined according to the formula set forth in the Pre-Funded Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants were exercisable upon issuance and did not expire. The exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants was subject to adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, splits, combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the common stock. Holders of Pre-Funded Warrants participated in any distributions to common stockholders as if the holders had exercised the Pre-Funded Warrants. The Company determined that the Pre-Funded Warrants were indexed to the Company s own stock and met the requirements for equity classification. Proceeds allocated to such warrants totaled million. Pre-Funded Warrants remain outstanding on September 30, 2024.

The Common Stock Warrants are exercisable upon issuance and expire on . The exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Common Stock Warrants are subject to adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, splits, combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the common stock. Holders of the Common Stock Warrants will participate in any distributions to common stockholders as if the holders had exercised the Common Stock Warrants. The Common Stock Warrants are redeemable upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Common Stock Purchase Warrant Agreement). The Company determined that the Common Stock Warrants are not indexed to the Company s own stock and therefore are precluded from equity classification. In addition, the Common Stock Warrant liability meets the definition of a derivative instrument. The Common Stock Warrants will be measured at fair value at inception and in subsequent reporting periods with changes in fair value recognized in income as change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the period of change in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the Common Stock Warrant liability at inception was million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Common Stock Warrants were exercised. On September 30, 2024 , Common Stock Warrants remain outstanding.

 Business Overview 
 Overview 
 We are an in vitro diagnostics company and leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes. Our technology enables rapid detection of pathogens, biomarkers and other abnormalities in a variety of unpurified patient sample types, including whole blood, plasma, serum, saliva, sputum and urine, and can detect cellular targets at limits of detection as low as one colony forming unit per milliliter, or CFU/mL. We are currently targeting what we believe to be a range of critically underserved healthcare conditions, focusing initially on those for which rapid detection may enable faster targeted antimicrobial treatment, improve patient outcomes, and reduce cost. Our current focus includes three areas sepsis, bioterrorism, and Lyme disease which we believe collectively represent a multi-billion dollar market opportunity. 
 Our primary commercial products include the T2Dx Instrument, the T2Bacteria Panel, the T2Candida Panel, the T2Resistance Panel, and the T2Biothreat Panel. Our sepsis products including the T2Dx Instrument, the T2Bacteria Panel, and the T2Candida Panel are FDA-cleared products able to detect sepsis-causing pathogens directly from blood. Where traditional diagnostics like blood cultures and post-culture diagnostics may take days to produce results, our products are designed to detect these pathogens in three to five hours. We believe our products provide a significant and sustainable competitive advantage compared to other products in our markets. 
 We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our accumulated deficit on September 30, 2024 was 616.9 million and we have experienced cash outflows from operating activities since inception. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs, from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations, and costs of product revenue. We have incurred significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of our FDA-cleared products, the T2Dx Instrument, T2Candida Panel, T2Bacteria Panel, and T2Biothreat Panel. In addition, we will continue to incur significant costs and expenses as we continue to develop other product candidates, improve existing products and maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio. We may seek to fund our operations through public equity or private equity or debt financings, as well as other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements if and when needed would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to develop, commercialize and drive adoption of the T2Dx Instrument and the T2Candida, T2Bacteria, T2Resistance, and T2Biothreat Panels and future products. 
 36 

We are subject to a number of risks similar to other early commercial stage life science companies, including, but not limited to commercially launching our products, development and market acceptance of our product candidates, development by our competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, and raising additional capital. 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents of 2.1 million on September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to fund our current operating plan unless additional funds are raised during the fourth quarter of 2024. Certain elements of our operating plan cannot be considered probable, and in order to support our business we initiated a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing value. 
 As part of our strategic restructuring program, we initiated a workforce reduction of nearly 30 in May 2023. Additionally, we are continuing to explore alternative strategic options, including an acquisition, merger, reverse merger, other business combination, sale of assets or licensing. We have also converted an aggregate of 30.0 million of outstanding principal under the Term Loan Agreement in exchange for equity in 2024, reducing total debt to CRG by approximately 80 percent from May 2023 amounts. 
 The Term Loan Agreement with CRG (See Note 6 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements) has a minimum liquidity covenant which initially required us to maintain a minimum cash balance of 5.0 million. In May 2023, CRG reduced the minimum liquidity covenant under the Term Loan Agreement from 5.0 million to 500,000 until December 31, 2023. In July 2023, April 2024, and May 2024, the Company converted 10.0 million, 15.0 million, and 15.0 million, respectively, of the outstanding debt with CRG to equity. In October 2023, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend both the interest-only period and the maturity date by one year from December 30, 2024 to December 31, 2025, and permanently reduce the minimum liquidity covenant from 5.0 million to 500,000. 
 In September 2023, the Company s milestone-based product development contract with BARDA expired, which may impact the Company s ability to continue to fund the development of its next-generation products. 
 These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months after the date that these financial statements are issued. Management s plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include raising additional funding, delaying certain research projects and capital expenditures and eliminating certain future operating expenses in order to fund operations at reduced levels for us to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from the date these financial statements are issued. Management has concluded the likelihood that its plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources or adequately reduce expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. See Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Product History 
 In September 2014, we received marketing authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our first two products, the T2Dx Instrument and the T2Candida Panel, or T2Candida. T2Candida, which runs on the T2Dx Instrument, has the ability to rapidly identify the five most clinically relevant species of Candida , a fungal pathogen known to cause sepsis, directly from blood specimens. The T2Dx Instrument and T2Candida were CE marked in the European Union, or the EU, in July 2014. 
 In May 2018, we received market clearance from the FDA for the T2Bacteria Panel, or T2Bacteria, which runs on the T2Dx Instrument and has the ability to rapidly identify six of the most common and deadly sepsis-causing bacteria directly from blood specimens. T2Bacteria was CE marked in the EU in June 2017. 
 In February 2019, our T2Resistance Panel, or T2Resistance, was granted FDA Breakthrough Device designation and, in November 2019, was CE marked in the EU. In December 2021, we initiated a U.S. clinical trial for T2Resistance. The clinical trial is expected to be completed in 2024, and we believe the data from this trial may enable submission of a marketing application to the FDA in Q1 2025. 
 In September 2019, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, an office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, awarded us a milestone-based contract for the development of a next-generation diagnostic instrument, a comprehensive sepsis panel and a multi-target biothreat panel. In September 2020, BARDA exercised the first contract option valued at 10.5 million. In April 2021, BARDA agreed to modify the contract to accelerate product development by advancing future deliverables and adding a U.S. T2Resistance Panel into Option 1 of the contract. In September 2021, BARDA exercised Option 2A valued at approximately 6.4 million to further advance the new product development initiatives. In December 2021, we initiated the U.S. clinical trials for T2Resistance and the T2Biothreat Panel, or T2Biothreat. In March 2022, BARDA exercised Option 2B valued at approximately 4.4 million. In May 2022, BARDA exercised Option 3 valued at approximately 3.7 million to complete the U.S. clinical trials for T2Resistance and T2Biothreat and subsequently submit applications to the FDA for U.S. regulatory clearance for those product candidates. In December 2022 the T2Biothreat clinical evaluation was completed. In May 2023, we submitted a 510(k) 
 37 

premarket notification to the FDA for T2Biothreat and in September 2023, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market T2Biothreat. The BARDA contract expired in September 2023. 
 In June 2020, we launched a COVID-19 molecular diagnostic test, the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, or T2SARS-CoV-2, after validation of the test pursuant to the FDA s policy permitting COVID-19 tests to be marketed prior to receipt of an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, subject to certain prerequisites. In August 2020, the FDA granted an EUA to T2SARS-CoV-2 for the qualitative direct detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. We marketed and sold T2SARS-CoV-2 between 2020 and 2023, with peak sales occurring during 2021. In 2023, we experienced decreased demand for the product as the incidence of COVID-19 infections decreased significantly and, as a result, we have stopped marketing, selling and manufacturing T2SARS-CoV-2. 
 In July 2022, we received Breakthrough Device designation for the T2Lyme Panel, or T2Lyme, a direct-from-blood molecular diagnostic test designed to run on the T2Dx Instrument and detect Borrelia burgdorferi , the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. T2Lyme is intended to test individuals with signs and symptoms of Lyme disease and aid in the diagnosis of early Lyme disease. In November 2022, the HHS and the Steven Alexandra Cohen Foundation, or Cohen Foundation, selected T2 Biosystems as a Phase 1 winner in the LymeX Diagnostics Prize, a LymeX Innovation Accelerator prize competition intended to accelerate the development of Lyme disease diagnostics. As a Phase 1 winner, we received 100,000 and an invitation to participate in a second phase. In February 2024, we were selected as a Phase 2 winner and received 265,000. 
 In July 2023, we received Breakthrough Device Designation for our Candida auris C. auris test, a direct-from-blood molecular diagnostic test designed to run on the T2Dx Instrument and detect C. auris . C. auris is a multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen recognized as a serious global health threat with a mortality rate of up to 60 , and is difficult to identify with standard laboratory methods, which can lead to inappropriate treatment. We plan to expand the test menu on the T2Dx Instrument by seeking 510(k) clearance from the FDA to add C. auris detection to the FDA-cleared T2Candida Panel. 
 In October 2023, we submitted a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA to expand the number of pathogens detected on the FDA-cleared T2Bacteria Panel to include the detection of Acinetobacter baumannii A. baumannii ). A. baumannii is a cause of bloodstream infections especially in critically ill patients, which can range from a benign transient bacteremia to septic shock. 
 In December 2023, we submitted a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA to expand the use of the T2Candida Panel to include pediatric testing. Candida species are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in hospitalized children. 
 In September 2024, we received clearance from the FDA to market the T2Candida Panel for pediatric patients. The Company expects to immediately begin marketing and selling the T2Candida Panel under the expanded pediatric claim. 
 Nasdaq Compliance Update 
 On March 30, 2023, the Company received notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, for the last thirty consecutive business days, the bid price for the Company s common stock had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 555(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price Rule ). On May 23, 2023, Nasdaq notified the Company that its securities were subject to delisting due to non-compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule and to maintain a minimum value of listed securities (the MVLS Rule of at least 35 million. The Company requested a hearing with Nasdaq and, on July 6, 2023, appealed to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel for an extension to the time period in which to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule and the Minimum Bid Price Rule. On July 26, 2023, we filed a definitive proxy statement to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock in connection with our annual meeting that occurred in September 2023 as required by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. On August 9, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it had regained compliance with the MVLS Rule. On September 15, 2023, at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s restated certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock. On October 12, 2023, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved the reverse stock split at the ratio of 1 post-split share for every 100 pre-split shares, which was effective as of October 12, 2023. 
 On October 31, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it has regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. The Company will be subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Company fails to comply with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, the Company will not be permitted additional time to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. However, the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel prior to the Company s securities being delisted from Nasdaq. 
 On November 20, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it no longer satisfied the MVLS Rule. In accordance with the terms of the Mandatory Panel Monitor, the Company was not granted a grace period but rather 
 38 

issued a delist determination. The Company exercised its right to appeal by requesting a hearing and paying a non-refundable 20,000 fee, which stayed any further action by Nasdaq pending the issuance of its decision and the expiration of any extension that may be granted to the Company as a result of the hearing. The Company s common stock remained listed and eligible to trade on Nasdaq pending the outcome of the hearing. On February 15, 2024, the Company appealed to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel for an extension to the time period in which to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule. On March 11, 2024, the Company received notice from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it had granted the Company s request for continued listing on Nasdaq, subject to the Company demonstrating compliance with Nasdaq s MVLS Rule on or before May 20, 2024. On May 21, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it has regained compliance with the MVLS Rule for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
 On November 7, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that the Company s market value of its listed securities has been below the minimum 35 million required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) for the previous 30 consecutive trading days. In accordance with the terms of the previously imposed Mandatory Panel Monitor as that term is defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff did not grant the Company a grace period but rather issued a delist determination, which will be stayed if the Company exercises its right to appeal the determination by requesting a hearing and paying a non-refundable 20,000 fee. Subsequently, the Company paid the non-refundable 20,000 fee and plans to request a hearing, which will stay any further action by Nasdaq at least pending the issuance of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel s decision and the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to the Company as a result of the hearing. The Company s common stock will remain listed and eligible to trade on Nasdaq pending the outcome of the hearing. There can be no assurance, however, that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel will grant the Company s request for continued listing or that the Company will evidence compliance with all applicable listing criteria prior to the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Panel to do so. 
 Financial Overview 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue from the sale of our products, related services, reagent rental agreements and government contributions. 
 Grants received, including cost reimbursement agreements, are assessed to determine if the agreement should be accounted for as an exchange transaction or a contribution. An agreement is accounted for as a contribution if the resource provider does not receive commensurate value in return for the assets transferred. 
 Product revenue is generated by the sale of instruments and consumable diagnostic tests predominantly through our direct sales force in the United States and distributors in geographic regions outside the United States. We generally do not offer product returns or exchange rights (other than those relating to defective goods under warranty) or price protection allowances to our customers, including our distributors. Payment terms granted to distributors are the same as those granted to end-user customers and payments are not dependent upon the distributors receipt of payment from their end-user customers. We either sell instruments to customers and international distributors or retain title and place the instrument at the customer site pursuant to a reagent rental agreement. When the instrument is placed under a reagent rental agreement, our customers generally agree to fixed term agreements, which can be extended, and incremental charges on each consumable diagnostic test purchased. Shipping and handling costs are billed to customers in connection with a product sale. 
 Fees paid to member-owned group purchasing organizations GPOs are deducted from related product revenues. 
 Direct sales of instruments include warranty, maintenance and technical support services typically for one year following the installation of the purchased instrument Maintenance Services ). Maintenance Services are separate performance obligations as they are service based warranties and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the service delivery period. After the completion of the initial Maintenance Services period, customers have the option to renew or extend the Maintenance Services typically for additional one-year periods in exchange for additional consideration. The extended Maintenance Services are also service based warranties that represent separate purchasing decisions. 
 We warrant that consumable diagnostic tests will be free from defects, when handled according to product specifications, for the stated life of the product. To fulfill valid warranty claims, we provide replacement product free of charge. 
 Our current sales strategy is to drive adoption of our test platform installed base in hospitals and to increase test use by our existing hospital customers. Accordingly, we expect the following to occur: 
 recurring revenue from our consumable diagnostic tests will increase; and 

39 

become a more predictable and significant component of total revenue; and 

gain manufacturing economies of scale through the growth in our sales, resulting in improving gross margins and operating margins. 

The BARDA contract expired in September 2023. 
 Cost of Product Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue includes the cost of materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs used in the manufacture of our consumable diagnostic tests sold to customers and related license and royalty fees. Cost of product revenue also includes depreciation on the revenue-generating T2Dx Instruments that have been placed with our customers under reagent rental agreements; costs of materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs on the T2Dx Instruments sold to customers; and other costs such as customer support costs, warranty and repair and maintenance expense on the T2Dx Instruments that have been placed with our customers under reagent rental agreements. We manufacture the T2Dx Instruments and part of our consumable diagnostic tests in our facilities. We outsource the manufacturing of components of our consumable diagnostic tests to contract manufacturers. We expect cost of product revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue as a result of the cost of product revenue improvement initiatives. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our technology and product candidates, technology improvements and enhancements, clinical trials to evaluate the clinical utility of our product candidates, and laboratory development and expansion, and include salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, research related facility and overhead costs, laboratory supplies, equipment, depreciation on T2Dx Instruments used in research and development activities and contract services. Research and development expenses also include costs of delivering products or services associated with contribution revenue. We expense all research and development costs as incurred. 
 We expect to continue developing additional product candidates, improving existing products, and conducting ongoing and new clinical trials. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for our sales, marketing, service, medical affairs, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, and general management functions, as well as professional services, such as legal, consulting and accounting services. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include commercial support activity, facility-related costs, fees and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents, clinical and economic studies and publications, marketing expenses, and travel expenses. We expense the majority of selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in future periods. 
 Impairment of property and equipment 
 Impairment of property and equipment relates to loss recorded when the carrying value of property and equipment is written down to its estimated fair value when indicators of impairment exist. 
 Interest expense to related party 
 Interest expense to related party consists primarily of interest expense on our notes payable, the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount. 
 Change in fair value of derivative related to Term Loan with related party 
 The change in fair value of derivative related to Term Loan with related party consists of the change in fair value of the derivative associated with the CRG Term Loan Agreement. 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities consists of the changes in fair value of the Common Stock Warrants and Series A Warrant. 
 Other, net 
 Other, net consists of dividend income, other investment income, interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, non-recurring expenses and non-recurring gains and losses.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 We have prepared our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses recorded during those periods. We evaluated our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We based our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 The items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 remained materially consistent. For a description of those critical accounting policies, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Product revenue 
 Product revenue was 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.5 million, which was driven by higher consumables sales of 0.4 million, higher instrument sales of 0.2 million, offset by lower instrument rental and service revenue of less than 0.1 million. 
 Cost of product revenue 
 Cost of product revenue was 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.2 million. The increase was driven by 0.5 million of increased costs related to higher instrument sales, 0.3 million of increased costs related to higher consumable sales, 0.1 million of increase shipping costs, partially offset by 0.7 million of decreased costs because of a change in build plan and manufacturing efficiencies. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which were flat compared to 2.7 million of expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development project related expenses increased by 0.8 million, which were offset by decreased lab and facility expenses of 0.6 million due to lower employee headcount and material purchases and decreased payroll related and stock-based compensation expense of 0.2 million due to lower employee headcount. 
 41 

Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.6 million. The decrease was driven by lower payroll related and stock-based compensation expenses of 0.7 million primarily due to lower employee headcount and 0.1 million of lower consulting and legal expenses, partially offset by 0.1 million of increased marketing costs and 0.1 million of increased other costs. 
 Impairment of property and equipment 
 There was no impairment of property and equipment for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Impairment of property and equipment was 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was comprised of 2.3 million of impairment charges related to reagent manufacturing assets and 0.2 million of impairment charges related to T2-owned non-lease instruments. 
 Interest expense to related party 
 Interest expense to related party was 0.4 million and 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense to related party decreased by 0.7 million primarily due to the cancellation of 10.0 million, 15.0 million, and 15.0 million of the CRG Term Loan s principal in exchange for equity in July 2023, April 2024, and May 2024, respectively. 
 Change in fair value of derivative related to Term Loan with related party 
 The change in fair value of the derivative instrument associated with the CRG Term Loan Agreement (see Note 6 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements) was a 0.1 million reduction of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 0.2 million reduction of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities consisted of a 0.3 million reduction of expense primarily associated with the Common Stock Warrants (see Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements) for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in fair value of the warrant liabilities consisted of 0.9 million of expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Product revenue 
 Product revenue was 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.9 million, which was driven by higher consumables sales of 1.0 million, offset by lower instrument sales of 0.1 million. 
 Contribution revenue 
 Contribution revenue relates to our BARDA agreement and we had no contribution revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.4 million of contribution revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The BARDA contract expired in September 2023. 
 Cost of product revenue 
 Cost of product revenue was 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.8 million. The decrease was driven by 2.6 million of decreased costs because of a change in build plan and manufacturing efficiencies and 0.4 million of lower service and repair costs, partially offset by 0.8 million of increased costs related to higher consumable sales, 0.3 million of increased shipping and other costs, and 0.1 million of increased instrument costs. 
 Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.2 million. Payroll related and stock-based compensation expenses decreased by 1.7 million due to lower employee headcount, lab and facility expenses decreased by 0.9 million due to lower employee headcount and material purchases, clinical expenses decreased by 0.4 million, and consulting expenses decreased by 0.1 million, partially offset by increased research and development project related expenses of 1.9 million. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 17.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 2.0 million. The decrease was driven by lower payroll related and stock-based compensation expenses of 2.4 million primarily due to lower employee headcount and lower other expenses of 0.1 million, partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in consulting and legal expenses, 0.1 million of increased costs related to IT support services and facilities, and 0.1 million of increased marketing costs. 
 Impairment of property and equipment 
 There was no impairment of property and equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Impairment of property and equipment was 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was comprised of 2.3 million of impairment charges related to reagent manufacturing assets and 0.2 million of impairment charges related to T2-owned non-lease instruments. 
 Interest expense to related party 
 Interest expense to related party was 2.0 million and 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense to related party decreased by 2.2 million primarily due to the cancellation of 10.0 million, 15.0 million, and 15.0 million of the CRG Term Loan s principal in exchange for equity in July 2023, April 2024, and May 2024, respectively. 
 Change in fair value of derivative related to Term Loan with related party 
 The change in fair value of the derivative instrument associated with the CRG Term Loan Agreement (see Note 6 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements) was a 1.2 million reduction of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 0.4 million reduction of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities consisted of a 0.2 million reduction of expense primarily associated with the Common Stock Warrants (see Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change in fair value of the warrant liabilities consisted of a 5.0 million reduction of expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 43 

Other, net 
 Other, net was a reduction of expense of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of a 0.3 million cash prize received for the Phase 2 LymeX Diagnostics Prize and 0.1 million of dividend income. Other, net was 0.6 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily consisting of issuance costs allocated to the Common Stock Warrants. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception, and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 616.9 million and 584.3 million, respectively. We have incurred significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We may seek to continue to fund our operations through public equity or private equity or debt financings, as well as other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements if and when needed would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Historically, the Company has primarily funded its operations through public equity and private debt financings. The Company believes its cash position is insufficient to fund future operations without financings during the fourth quarter of 2024. Financings may include public or private equity or debt financings. These financings may not be successful, however, or on terms favorable to the Company or its stockholders which would have a negative impact on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and the Company s ability to develop and commercialize its products and ultimately operate as a going-concern. 
 Equity Distribution Agreement 
 On March 31, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement Equity Distribution Agreement with Canaccord Genuity LLC, as agent Canaccord ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of common stock, for aggregate gross sale proceeds of up to 75.0 million from time to time from the effective date of the respective registration statement through Canaccord. In July 2023, the Company filed an amendment to the prospectus supplement relating to the offer and sale of shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement to increase the maximum amount of shares that the Company may sell pursuant to its Equity Distribution Agreement with Canaccord Genuity by 65 million. At the time of the amendment, the Company had sold shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of 71.3 million. Under the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company sold no shares of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1,015,385 shares of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2023 for net proceeds of 21.7 million. Under the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company sold 628,470 shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for net proceeds of 2.2 million, and 3,167,968 shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for net proceeds of 41.0 million. 
 We paid Canaccord for its services of acting as agent 3 of the gross proceeds from the sale of the shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement. Legal and accounting fees are reclassified to share capital upon issuance of shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement. 
 On July 19, 2024, the Equity Distribution Agreement with Canaccord was terminated pursuant to the terms therein. The Company is not subject to any termination penalties related to the termination of the Equity Distribution Agreement. 
 Wainwright Equity Distribution Agreement 
 On July 19, 2024, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the "Wainwright Equity Distribution Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC, as agent Wainwright ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of common stock, for aggregate gross sale proceeds of up to 14.7 million from time to time from the effective date of the respective registration statement through Wainwright. In August 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement relating to the offer and sale of shares under the Wainwright Equity Distribution Agreement to increase the maximum amount of shares that the Company may sell pursuant to the Wainwright Equity Distribution Agreement by 13.4 million. At the time of the prospectus supplement, the Company had sold shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of 2.8 million under the Wainwright Equity Distribution Agreement. 
 We pay Wainwright for its services of acting as agent 3 of the gross proceeds from the sale of the shares pursuant to the Wainwright Equity Distribution Agreement. Legal and accounting fees are reclassified to share capital upon issuance of shares under the Wainwright Equity Distribution Agreement. Under the Wainwright Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company sold 1,365,710 shares during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for net proceeds of 4.1 million. 
 44 

Plan of operations and future funding requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately 2.1 million. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, costs related to our products, clinical trials, laboratory and related supplies, supplies and materials used in manufacturing, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs. 
 Until such time as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs, beyond what is currently available or on hand, through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and revenue from existing and potential research and development and other collaboration agreements. If we raise additional funds in the future, we may need to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 
 Going Concern 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents of 2.1 million on September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to fund our current operating plan at least 12 months from issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements unless additional funds are raised during the fourth quarter of 2024. Certain elements of our operating plan cannot be considered probable. 
 The Company's Term Loan Agreement (see Note 6 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements) has a minimum liquidity covenant, which initially required the Company to maintain a minimum cash balance of 5.0 million. In May 2023, CRG reduced the minimum liquidity covenant under the Term Loan Agreement from 5.0 million to 500,000 until December 31, 2023. In July 2023, April 2024, and May 2024, the Company converted 10.0 million, 15.0 million, and 15.0 million, respectively, of the outstanding debt principal with CRG to equity. In October 2023, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend both the interest-only period and the maturity date by one year from December 30, 2024 to December 31, 2025, and permanently reduce the minimum liquidity covenant from 5.0 million to 500,000. Unless the Company raises additional funds, management believes that it is probable that the Company will not be able to comply with the minimum liquidity covenant. 
 On March 30, 2023, the Company received notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, for the last thirty consecutive business days, the bid price for the Company s common stock had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 555(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price Rule ). On May 23, 2023, Nasdaq notified the Company that its securities were subject to delisting due to non-compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule and to maintain a minimum value of listed securities (the MVLS Rule of at least 35 million. The Company requested a hearing with Nasdaq and, on July 6, 2023, appealed to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel for an extension to the time period in which to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule and the Minimum Bid Price Rule. On July 26, 2023, we filed a definitive proxy statement to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock in connection with our annual meeting that occurred in September 2023 as required by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. On August 9, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it had regained compliance with the MVLS Rule. On September 15, 2023, at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s restated certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock. On October 12, 2023, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved the reverse stock split at the ratio of 1 post-split share for every 100 pre-split shares, which was effective as of October 12, 2023. 
 On October 31, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it has regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. The Company will be subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Company fails to comply with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, the Company will not be permitted additional time to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. However, the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel prior to the Company s securities being delisted from Nasdaq. 
 On November 20, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it no longer satisfied the MVLS Rule. In accordance with the terms of the Mandatory Panel Monitor, the Company was not granted a grace period but rather issued a delist determination. The Company exercised its right to appeal by requesting a hearing and paying a non-refundable 20,000 fee, which stayed any further action by Nasdaq pending the issuance of its decision and the expiration of any extension that may be granted to the Company as a result of the hearing. The Company s common stock remained listed and eligible to trade on Nasdaq pending the outcome of the hearing. On February 15, 2024, the Company appealed to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel for an extension to the time period in which to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule. On March 11, 2024, the Company received notice from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it had granted the Company s request for continued listing on Nasdaq, subject to the Company demonstrating compliance with Nasdaq s MVLS Rule on or before May 20, 2024. On May 21, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it has regained compliance with the MVLS Rule for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
 45 

On November 7, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that the Company s market value of its listed securities has been below the minimum 35 million required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) for the previous 30 consecutive trading days. In accordance with the terms of the previously imposed Mandatory Panel Monitor as that term is defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff did not grant the Company a grace period but rather issued a delist determination, which will be stayed if the Company exercises its right to appeal the determination by requesting a hearing and paying a non-refundable 20,000 fee. Subsequently, the Company paid the non-refundable 20,000 fee and plans to request a hearing, which will stay any further action by Nasdaq at least pending the issuance of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel s decision and the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to the Company as a result of the hearing. The Company s common stock will remain listed and eligible to trade on Nasdaq pending the outcome of the hearing. There can be no assurance, however, that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel will grant the Company s request for continued listing or that the Company will evidence compliance with all applicable listing criteria prior to the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Panel to do so. 
 These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months after the date that these financial statements are issued. Management's plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include raising additional funding and maintaining reduced operating expenses in order to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from the date these financial statements are issued. Management has concluded the likelihood that its plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources or maintain reduced expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.

Net cash used in operating activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 27.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted of a net loss of 32.6 million adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense of 2.0 million, non-cash lease expense of 1.1 million, non-cash interest expense to related party of 0.5 million, a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 0.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 0.2 million, a change in fair value of the derivative related to Term Loan with related party of 1.2 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 3.0 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable of 2.7 million due to the timing of invoices, payments, and an increase in past due payables, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of 1.4 million due to the timing of deposits for goods and services, and a decrease in inventory of 1.0 million due to the timing of purchases and shipments, partially offset by a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 1.2 million, an increase in accounts receivable of 0.6 million due to the timing and volume of instrument and consumable sales, and a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of 0.3 million. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 38.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted of a net loss of 39.7 million adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense of 3.6 million, a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 5.0 million, non-cash interest expense of 1.3 million, non-cash lease expense of 1.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 0.8 million, issuance costs related to Common Stock Warrants of 0.7 million, a change in fair value of the derivative related to Term Loan of 0.4 million, an impairment of property and equipment of 2.5 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 3.5 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a decrease in accrued expenses of 2.4 million primarily due to the payout of 2022 bonuses and a 1.0 million reduction to legal fees due 
 46 

to expensing of the 1.0 million rent deposit for the Billerica lease, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of 1.0 million, an increase in inventory of 0.5 million due to timing of purchases and shipments, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 0.5 million due to timing of deposits for goods and services, and a decrease in accounts payable of 0.2 million due to timing of invoices and payments, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of 1.0 million due to payment from BARDA and the timing and volume of instrument and consumable sales, and an increase in deferred revenue of 0.1 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 There was no net cash provided by or used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted of equipment purchases. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted of proceeds from the May 2024 private offering, net of issuance costs, of 7.3 million and proceeds from sales of our common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement and Wainwright Equity Distribution Agreement, net of issuance costs, of 6.2 million. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 51.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of our common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement, net of issuance costs, of 41.0 million and proceeds from the February 2023 public offering, net of issuance costs, of 10.9 million, offset by payment of debt issuance costs of 0.1 million. 
 Borrowing Arrangements 
 Term Loan Agreement 
 In December 2016, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement with CRG. We initially borrowed 40.0 million under the Term Loan Agreement and had the ability to borrow an additional 10.0 million upon receiving specified clearance for the marketing of T2Bacteria by April 30, 2018 (the Approval Milestone ). We agreed to pay (1) a financing fee based on the amount of principal drawn and (2) a final payment fee based on the principal outstanding upon repayment. The debt discount related to the financing fee and the fees paid to CRG are being amortized over the loan term as interest expense. The final payment fee is accrued as interest expense and is classified consistent with the classification of the Term Loan. 
 The Term Loan s principal is prepayable at any time partially or in full without a prepayment penalty. Borrowings are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of our assets, including intellectual property. The Term Loan Agreement provides for affirmative and negative covenants, and initially included a requirement to maintain a minimum cash balance of 5.0 million. The Term Loan Agreement includes a subjective acceleration clause whereby an event of default, including a material adverse change in the business, operations, or conditions (financial or otherwise), could result, at CRG s discretion, in the acceleration of the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate of an additional 4.0 per annum may apply, at CRG s discretion, on all outstanding obligations during the occurrence and continuance of an event of default. 
 The Term Loan originally had a six-year term, with three years of interest-only payments accruing at a fixed rate of 12.5 , of which 4.0 could be paid in-kind by increasing the principal balance. After achievement of the Approval Milestone, such rates would be reduced and a fourth year of interest-only payments would be granted, after which quarterly payments of principal and interest would be owed through the December 30, 2022 maturity date. Upon achievement of certain performance metrics, the loan would be converted to interest-only until its maturity, at which time all unpaid principal and interest would be due and payable. 
 In connection with the Term Loan Agreement, we issued warrants to CRG to purchase a total of 105 shares of our common stock, exercisable any time prior to December 30, 2026. 
 Amendments 
 The Term Loan Agreement has been amended eleven times. As a result of those amendments, certain terms of the Term Loan have been revised as follows: 
 In 2018, upon our achievement of the Approval Milestone, interest on borrowings began accruing at 11.50 per year, 8 of which is payable in cash quarterly and 3.5 of which is deferred and added to principal until maturity. 

47 

In 2019: 

The final payment fee was increased from 8 to 10 of the principal outstanding upon repayment. 

We issued additional warrants to CRG to purchase 113 shares of our common stock, exercisable any time prior to September 9, 2029 at an exercise price of 7,750.00 per share, with provisions for termination upon a change of control or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets (these warrants, along with the warrants to purchase 105 shares of common stock previously issued to CRG, are collectively referred to as the CRG Warrants ). 

We reduced the exercise price for the warrants previously issued to CRG to 7,750.00. 

In 2022, the principal maturity date was extended to December 30, 2024, and the Term Loan s interest-only payment period was extended until that maturity date. 

In 2023: 

We entered into a waiver and consent with CRG that reduced the minimum liquidity covenant to 500,000 until December 31, 2023. 

CRG waived certain specified events of default associated with our issuance of shares of Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock in August 2022 and the subsequent redemption (See Note 7 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements). 

In July 2023, CRG canceled 10.0 million of the Term Loan s principal in exchange for 483,457 shares of common stock and 93,297 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. In connection with the principal cancelation, CRG waived the final payment fees associated with the canceled principal. 

In October 2023, the interest-only period and maturity of the Term Loan were extended to December 31, 2025 and the 500,000 liquidity covenant was made permanent. 

In 2024: 

In April 2024, CRG canceled 15.0 million of the Term Loan's principal in exchange for 3,280,618 shares of common stock and 17,160.48 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In connection with the principal cancelation, CRG waived the final payment fees associated with the canceled principal. In addition, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to extend the period in which the Company may elect to pay a portion of the accrued paid-in-kind interest to the earlier of (a) December 31, 2025 and (b) the date on which a default has occurred. 

In May 2024, CRG canceled 15.0 million of the Term Loan's principal in exchange for 4,748,335 shares of common stock. In connection with the principal cancelation, CRG waived the final payment fees associated with the canceled principal. In addition, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to allow CRG or their affiliates to acquire a majority of shares in the Company without causing a change of control as defined under the Term Loan Agreement. 

The warrants to purchase 218 shares of our common stock remain outstanding on September 30, 2024. There were no covenant violations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Amendments made in February 2022, November 2022, October 2023, and the partial principal cancellation in July 2023, April 2024, and May 2024 were accounted for as troubled debt restructurings. For all restructurings, at the time of the restructuring the future undiscounted cash outflows required under the amended agreement exceeded the carrying value of the debt and no gain was recognized as a result of the restructurings. The effects of each restructuring were accounted for prospectively. 
 Classification 
 The Term Loan Agreement with CRG was classified as a current liability both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In May 2023, we received a modification and waiver reducing the Term Loan s minimum cash covenant from 5.0 million to 500,000 until December 31, 2023. In addition, in October 2023, the interest-only period and maturity of the Term Loan were extended to December 31, 2025, and the 500,000 liquidity covenant was made permanent. Because management believes it is probable that we will not be able to comply with the covenant unless additional funds are raised, we concluded that the Term Loan and related liabilities should be classified as current. 
 We have a single compound derivative instrument related to our Term Loan Agreement that requires us to pay additional interest of 4 per annum upon an event of default or if any obligation other than the unpaid principal amount of the Term Loan is not paid when 
 48 

due. Fair value is determined quarterly. The fair value of the derivative was 0.3 million and 1.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets to match the classification of the related Term Loan Agreement. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There were no other material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments from those described under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk 
 As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide this information. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over (1) the timeliness of assumptions and accounting conclusions reached for unusual transactions, (2) the accounting impact of changes in our sales demand forecast, (3) our year-end reagent inventory count process, and (4) the review of the year-end tax provision and 382 study prepared by third-party experts. Each of these material weaknesses were included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and remain unremediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company took actions to remediate the deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting and implemented additional processes designed to address the underlying causes associated with the above-mentioned material weaknesses. These include (1) enhanced evaluation considerations of unusual transactions including the timely use of third-party experts, (2) enhanced evaluation procedures to consider the effect of changes in our sales demand forecast, (3) enhanced physical inventory count procedures, and (4) enhanced review procedures of the year-end tax provision and 382 study prepared by third-party experts. 
 Management will monitor the progress of the remediation plan and report regularly to the audit committee on the progress and results of the remediation plan, including the identification, status and resolution of internal control deficiencies. As the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to take additional measures to address the material weaknesses or determine to modify the remediation plans described above. Until the remediation steps set forth above are fully implemented and operating for a sufficient period of time, the material weaknesses described above will continue to exist. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except as noted above, there have been no changes to the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

PART II. 
 OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 On September 8, 2021, the Company entered into a 10-year lease agreement (the Lease with Farley White Concord Road, LLC (the Landlord ), pursuant to which the Company leased approximately 70,125 square feet for its occupancy and use as office, laboratory and commercial manufacturing space at 290 Concord Road, Billerica, Massachusetts (the Premises"). 
 On January 17, 2023, the Landlord sent a Notice of Termination (the Notice of the Lease to the Company. The Notice provides that the Landlord terminated the Lease because of the Company s alleged failure to perform its obligations under the Lease in a timely manner and the Company s alleged breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In connection with the Notice, on January 18, 2023, the Landlord filed a complaint in the Massachusetts Superior Court and has unilaterally deducted the Company s 1,000,000 security deposit for its alleged damages. In addition, the Landlord is seeking damages for unpaid rent, brokerage fees, transaction costs, attorney's fees and court costs. 
 On March 1, 2023, the Company filed a response to the Landlord s complaint and a counterclaim alleging that the Landlord breached its obligations under the contract and unlawfully drew on the security deposit, in addition to breaching its covenants of good faith and fair dealing, making fraudulent misrepresentations, and engaging in deceptive and unfair trade practices. 
 The Company intends to pursue legal remedies available under applicable laws. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern if we are unable to raise additional capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to arrange financing in the near term we may be forced to suspend operations, sell assets or seek protection by filing a voluntary petition for bankruptcy relief, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could impact your investment. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.1 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents which, without additional funding, will not be sufficient to meet our obligations for a period of 12 months after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company believes its cash position is insufficient to fund future operations without financings during the fourth quarter of 2024. Based on their assessment, our management has substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. As substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists, our ability to finance our operations through equity financing or otherwise could be impaired. 
 Our ability to fund working capital, make capital expenditures, and service our debt depends on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to its future operating success, and obtain financing on reasonable terms, which is subject to factors beyond our control, including general economic, political, and financial market conditions. The capital markets have in the past experienced, are currently experiencing, and may in the future experience, periods of upheaval that could impact the availability and cost of financing and there can be no assurances that such financing will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms, or at all. Management continues to explore raising additional capital through equity financing to supplement the Company s capitalization and liquidity, but there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms commercially acceptable to the Company, or at all. Any inability to raise adequate funds on commercially reasonable terms in the near term could force us to suspend operations, sell assets or seek protection by filing a voluntary petition for bankruptcy relief, which may result in a significant decrease in value for all stockholders and cause our stockholders to lose some or all of their investment. 
 Our failure to maintain the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock. 
 In 2023, the Company received notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, for the last thirty consecutive business days, the bid price for the Company s common stock had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 555(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price Rule and also that its securities were subject to delisting due to non-compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule and to maintain a minimum value of listed securities (the MVLS Rule of at least 35 million. The Company requested a hearing with Nasdaq and, on July 6, 2023, appealed to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel for an extension to the time period in which to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule and the 
 50 

Minimum Bid Price Rule. On July 26, 2023, we filed a definitive proxy statement to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock in connection with our annual meeting that occurred in September 2023 as required by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. On August 9, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it had regained compliance with the MVLS Rule. On September 15, 2023, at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company s restated certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock. On October 12, 2023, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved the reverse stock split at the ratio of 1 post-split share for every 100 pre-split shares, which was effective as of October 12, 2023. 
 On October 31, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. The Company was subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Company failed to comply with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, the Company would not be permitted additional time to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. However, the Company would have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel prior to the Company s securities being delisted from Nasdaq. 
 On November 20, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it no longer satisfied the MVLS Rule. In accordance with the terms of the Mandatory Panel Monitor, the Company was not granted a grace period but rather issued a delist determination. The Company exercised its right to appeal by requesting a hearing and paying a non-refundable 20,000 fee, which stayed any further action by Nasdaq pending the issuance of its decision and the expiration of any extension that may be granted to the Company as a result of the hearing. The Company s common stock remained listed and eligible to trade on Nasdaq pending the outcome of the hearing. On February 15, 2024, the Company appealed to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel for an extension to the time period in which to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule. On March 11, 2024, the Company received notice from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it had granted the Company s request for continued listing on Nasdaq, subject to the Company demonstrating compliance with Nasdaq s MVLS Rule on or before May 20, 2024. On May 21, 2024, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that it has regained compliance with the MVLS Rule for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq has informed the Company that it will be subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year from the date of the letter. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Company fails to comply with any continued listing requirement, the Company will not be permitted additional time to regain compliance with such requirement. However, the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Hearing Panel prior to the Company s securities being delisted from Nasdaq. 
 On November 7, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that the Company s market value of its listed securities has been below the minimum 35 million required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) for the previous 30 consecutive trading days. In accordance with the terms of the previously imposed Mandatory Panel Monitor as that term is defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff did not grant the Company a grace period but rather issued a delist determination, which will be stayed if the Company exercises its right to appeal the determination by requesting a hearing and paying a non-refundable 20,000 fee. Subsequently, the Company paid the non-refundable 20,000 fee and plans to request a hearing, which will stay any further action by Nasdaq at least pending the issuance of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel s decision and the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to the Company as a result of the hearing. The Company s common stock will remain listed and eligible to trade on Nasdaq pending the outcome of the hearing. There can be no assurance, however, that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel will grant the Company s request for continued listing or that the Company will evidence compliance with all applicable listing criteria prior to the expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Panel to do so. 
 The failure to maintain the continued listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms in the future. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. Further, if we were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our common stock would cease to be recognized as covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Moreover, there is no assurance that any actions that we take to restore our compliance with the MVLS Rule and Minimum Bid Price Rule will stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from falling below the minimum value of listed securities required for continued listing again, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements.
