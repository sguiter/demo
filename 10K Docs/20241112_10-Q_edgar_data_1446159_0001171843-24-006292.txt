+ cancer tumor samples, categorized by patient type, against drug compounds to help the drug discovery process and increase the probability of successful drug development. The Company offers a suite of solutions for oncology drug development from early discovery to clinical trials. 

Predictive Oncology s mission is to change the landscape of oncology drug discovery and enable the development of more effective therapies for the treatment of cancer. By harnessing the power of machine learning and scientific rigor, the Company believes that it can improve the probability of success of advancing pharmaceutical and biological drug candidates with a higher degree of confidence. 

During the third quarter of 2024, the Company s former Birmingham operating segment, which provided contract services and research focused on solubility improvements, stability studies and protein production, met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. As a result, the Company operates in two business areas. In its first area, the Company provides optimized, high-confidence drug-response predictions through the application of AI using its proprietary biobank of tumor samples to enable a more informed selection of drug/tumor combinations and increase the probability of success during drug development. The Company also creates and develops tumor-specific 3D cell culture models mimicking the physiological environment of human tissue enabling better-informed decision-making during development. In its second business area, the Company produces the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA )-cleared STREAMWAY System and associated products for automated medical fluid waste management and patient-to-drain medical fluid disposal. 

As a result of the decision to discontinue its former Birmingham operating segment, the Company has two reportable segments, which have been delineated by location and business area, as further described in Note 13 Segments : 

Pittsburgh segment: provides services that include the application of AI using its proprietary biobank of + tumor samples. Pittsburgh also creates proprietary 3D culture models used in drug development. 

Eagan segment : produces the FDA-cleared STREAMWAY System and associated products for automated medical fluid waste management and patient-to-drain medical fluid disposal. 

. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of as of September 30, 2024, and needs to raise significant additional capital to meet its operating needs. The Company had short-term obligations of and long-term operating lease obligations of as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not expect to generate sufficient operating revenue to sustain its operations in the near term. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred negative cash flows from continuing operating activities of . Although the Company has attempted to improve its cash flows from continuing operating activities by bolstering revenues and continues to seek ways to generate revenue through business development activities, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to improve its cash flows from continuing operating activities sufficiently or achieve profitability in the near term. As a result of these conditions, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

The Company is evaluating alternatives to obtain the required additional funding to maintain future operations. These alternatives may include, but are not limited to, equity financing, issuing debt, entering into other financing arrangements, or monetizing operating businesses or assets. These possibilities, to the extent available, may be on terms that result in significant dilution to the Company s existing stockholders or that result in the Company s existing stockholders losing part or all of their investment. Despite these potential sources of funding, the Company may be unable to access financing or obtain additional liquidity when needed or under acceptable terms, if at all. If such financing or adequate funds from operations are not available, the Company would be forced to limit its business activities and the Company could default on existing payment obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations, and the Company may ultimately be required to cease its operations and liquidate its business. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Wainwright was permitted to sell the Shares by methods deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Under the Sales Agreement, Wainwright was entitled to compensation for its services of of the gross sales price of all shares sold through Wainwright under the Sales Agreement. As of June 30, 2024, the Company sold shares of common stock at an average price of approximately per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately . No further shares are available to be sold under the Sales Agreement. 

Warrant Inducement Transaction 

On July 25, 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements with certain of its existing warrant holders for the exercise of warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of its common stock having a current exercise price of originally issued in February 2021, June 2021 and May 2022, at a reduced exercise price of per share. The gross proceeds to the Company from the exercise of the existing warrants were approximately , prior to deducting placement agent fees and transaction expenses payable by the Company. The reduction of the exercise price represented a modification to the existing warrants, which was recognized as an equity issuance cost of charged against the proceeds of the offering. 

In consideration for the immediate cash exercise of the warrants, the Company concurrently issued to the warrant holders new unregistered Series A warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock (the Series A Warrants and new Series B warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock (the Series B Warrants ). The Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants have an exercise price of per share and are exercisable immediately upon issuance. The Series A Warrants have a term equal to five years from the date of issuance, and the Series B Warrants have a term equal to months from the date of issuance. 

The transactions described above closed on July 26, 2024. Wainwright acted as the exclusive placement agent for the above-mentioned transactions. The Company paid Wainwright as consideration (i) an aggregate cash fee equal to of the gross proceeds from the exercise of the existing warrants, (ii) a management fee equal to of the aggregate gross proceeds from the exercise of the existing warrants, (iii) for expenses, and (iv) for clearing fees. Additionally, the Company issued to Wainwright (or its designees) as compensation, warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock of the Company (equal to of the aggregate number of existing warrants exercised in the offering) (the Placement Agent Warrants ). The Placement Agent Warrants have a term of five years from the closing of the offering and an exercise price of per share. 

Equity Incentive Plan 

The Company s Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2012 Plan allows for the issuance of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock, restricted stock units RSUs and performance awards to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company, where permitted under the plan. The exercise price for each stock option is determined by the market price on the date of issuance. Vesting requirements are determined by the Board of Directors when granted and currently range from immediate to three years. Options outstanding under this plan have a contractual life of ten years. 

ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718 ), requires that a company that issues equity as compensation record compensation expense that corresponds to the estimated cost of those equity grants. ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model or other acceptable means. 

Valuation and Accounting for Stock Options and Warrants 

The Company determines the grant date fair value of options and warrants using a Black-Scholes option valuation model based upon assumptions regarding risk-free interest rate, expected dividend rate, volatility, and estimated term.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis should be read together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that are management s present expectations of future events. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those set forth below and elsewhere in this report, many of which are beyond our control. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements include: 

Our ability to continue operating beyond twelve months without additional financing; 

Continued negative operating cash flows; 

Our capital needs to accomplish our goals, including any further financing, which may be highly dilutive and may include onerous terms; 

Risks related to recent and future acquisitions, including risks related to the benefits and costs of acquisition; 

Risks related to our partnerships with other companies, including the need to negotiate the definitive agreements; possible failure to realize anticipated benefits of these partnerships; and costs of providing funding to our partner companies, which may never be repaid or provide anticipated returns; 

Risks related to the initiation, formation, or success of our collaboration arrangements, commercialization activities and product sales levels by our collaboration partners and future payments that may come due to us under these arrangements, 

Risk that we will be unable to protect our intellectual property or claims that we are infringing on others intellectual property; 

The impact of competition; 

Acquisition and maintenance of any necessary regulatory clearances applicable to applications of our technology; 

Inability to attract or retain qualified senior management personnel, including sales and marketing personnel; 

Risk that we never become profitable if our products and services are not accepted by potential customers; 

Possible impact of government regulation and scrutiny; 

Unexpected costs and operating deficits, and lower than expected sales and revenues, if any; 

Adverse results of any legal proceedings; 

The volatility of our operating results and financial condition, 

Management of growth; 

Risk that our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by disruptions caused by economic and geopolitical uncertainties as well as epidemics or pandemics; and 

Other specific risks that may be alluded to in this report. 

22

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report regarding our growth strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenue or losses, projected costs, prospects and plans, and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words will, may, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, expect, project, plan, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other information contained herein. Potential investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, and expectations reflected in or suggested by the forward-looking statements in this report are reasonable, we cannot assure potential investors that these plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. We disclose important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in Item 1A of Part II below. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. 

Overview 

We are a knowledge and science-driven company that applies artificial intelligence AI to support the discovery and development of optimal cancer therapies, which can ultimately lead to more effective treatments and improved patient outcomes. We use AI and a proprietary biobank of 150,000+ tumor samples, categorized by tumor type, to provide actionable insights about drug compounds to improve the drug discovery process and increase the probability of drug compound success. We offer a suite of solutions for oncology drug development from early discovery to clinical trials. 

Our mission is to change the landscape of oncology drug discovery and enable the development of more effective therapies for the treatment of cancer. By harnessing the power of machine learning and scientific rigor, we believe that we can improve the probability of success of advancing pharmaceutical and biological drug candidates with a higher degree of confidence. 

During the third quarter of 2024, our former Birmingham operating segment met the criteria under US GAAP to be reported as discontinued operations. As a result, we operate in two business areas. In our first area, we provide optimized, high-confidence drug-response predictions through the application of AI using our proprietary biobank of tumor samples to enable a more informed selection of drug/tumor combinations and increase the probability of success during development. We also create and develop tumor-specific 3D cell culture models mimicking the physiological environment of human tissue enabling better-informed decision-making during development. In our second business area, we produce the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA )-cleared STREAMWAY System and associated products for automated medical fluid waste management and patient-to-drain medical fluid disposal. 

As a result of the decision to discontinue our former Birmingham operating segment, we have two reportable segments, which have been delineated by location and business area: 

Pittsburgh segment: provides services that include the application of AI using its proprietary biobank of 150,000+ tumor samples. Pittsburgh also creates proprietary 3D culture models used in drug development. 

Eagan segment: produces the FDA-cleared STREAMWAY System and associated products for automated medical fluid waste management and patient-to-drain medical fluid disposal. 

Capital Requirements 

Since inception, we have been unprofitable. We incurred net losses of 10,494,794 and 10,508,620 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 178,256,677 and 167,761,883, respectively. 

We have never generated sufficient revenues to fund our capital requirements. We have funded our operations through a variety of debt and equity instruments. Since 2017, we have diversified our business by investing in ventures, including making significant loans and investments in early-stage companies. These activities led to the acquisition of Helomics Corporation in April 2019, two transactions to acquire the assets of three businesses in 2020, and the acquisition of zPREDICTA Inc. in November 2021, each of which have accelerated our capital needs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Plan of Financing; Going Concern and Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Transactions below. 

23

Our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds depend on our ability to generate revenues from our oncology business located in Pittsburgh; our ability to continue to sell our Skyline Medical products and services and to reach profitability in all our businesses; and the availability of future financing to fulfill our business plans. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Plan of Financing; Going Concern below. 

Our limited history of operations, especially in our drug discovery business, and our change in the emphasis of our business, starting in 2017, makes prediction of future operating results difficult. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied on as predictive of our future results. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison of three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a strategic cost savings initiative, primarily related to the Company s Birmingham laboratory. After extensive consideration, we decided that transferring the laboratory equipment and related product/service lines from Birmingham to Pittsburgh would not be a strategic and effective use of Company resources. In aggregate, the disposal of the assets comprising the former Birmingham operating segment resulted in a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. 

As a result of the strategic cost savings initiative, historical results of the former Birmingham operating segment have been reflected as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements for all historical periods presented in the statements of net loss. Assets and liabilities associated with the former Birmingham operating segment are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additional disclosures regarding discontinued operations, including results from discontinued operations, are provided in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

The results presented below, and the following discussion, are based on and relate to our continuing operations.

Revenue. We recorded revenue of 345,686 and 676,626 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily derived from the Eagan operating segment, while revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily derived from the Pittsburgh operating segment. The decrease in revenue from the comparative period was primarily due to decreased sales of tumor-specific 3D cell culture models from the Pittsburgh operating segment, offset by increased sales of STREAMWAY systems during the third quarter of 2024 from the Eagan operating segment. 

We recorded revenue of 1,012,232 and 1,308,102 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, was primarily derived from the Eagan operating segment. The decrease in revenue from the comparative nine-month period was also primarily due to decreased sales of tumor-specific 3D cell culture models in 2024 from the Pittsburgh operating segment, offset by increased sales of STREAMWAY systems during 2024 from the Eagan operating segment. 

24

Cost of sales. Cost of sales was 196,919 and 97,868 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The gross profit margin was approximately 43 and 86 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decline in gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to increased labor costs and a change in sales mix with decreased sales of 3D models with higher margins than STREAMWAY systems. 

Cost of sales was 535,511 and 367,461 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The gross profit margin was approximately 47 and 72 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decline in gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was also primarily due to increased labor costs and the change in sales mix with decreased sales of 3D models with higher margins than STREAMWAY systems. 

General and administrative expense. General and administrative G A expense primarily consists of management salaries, professional fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, and general office expenses. G A expense decreased by 761,949 to 1,582,671 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,344,620 in the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased employee compensation related to lower headcount related expenses and severance for former employees. 

G A expense decreased by 988,541 to 5,834,783 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6,823,324 in the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased employee compensation due to lower headcount and decreased investor relations costs, offset by increased audit fees and consultant fees. 

Operations expense. Operations expense primarily consists of expenses related to product development and prototyping and testing. Operations expense decreased by 5,274 to 633,422 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 638,696 in the comparable period in 2023. The minor decrease was primarily due to decreased cloud computing expenses resulting from cost saving efforts, offset by increased costs associated with our Pittsburgh laboratory including supplies and maintenance. 

Operations expense increased by 88,962 to 2,188,936 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,099,974 in the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation, offset by lower cloud computing expenses and recruiting fees. 

Sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expenses consist of expenses required to market and sell our products including staff-related expenses for individuals performing this work. Sales and marketing expense decreased by 87,789 to 246,650 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 334,439 in the comparable period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower employee compensation including sales commissions. 

Sales and marketing expense increased by 156,412 to 1,268,824 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,112,412 in the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to severance related to a former executive, offset by lower other employee compensation costs related to lower headcount and sales commissions. 

Other income. We earned other income of 36,378 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 47,838 in the comparable period in 2023. We earned other income of 64,497 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 118,618 in the comparable period in 2023. Other income in all periods primarily consisted of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. 

Other expense. We incurred other expense of 5,822 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 60,671 in the comparable period in 2023. We incurred other expense of 9,393 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 60,671 in the comparable period in 2023. Other expense in 2024 consisted primarily of interest expense, while other expense in 2023 was primarily due to the write off of a note receivable deemed uncollectible. 

Gain on derivative instruments. We recorded a gain of 7 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,463 in the comparable period in 2023. We recorded a gain of 1,375 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11,724 in the comparable period in 2023. These gains related to the change in fair value of the derivative instruments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flows 

Net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations was 8,913,589 and 9,060,285 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Cash used in operating activities decreased in the 2024 period primarily because of changes in working capital. 

Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was 9,510 and 63,052 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Cash used in investing activities decreased in the 2024 period primarily due to a decrease in fixed asset purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was 4,134,970 and 260,221 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The cash provided in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the ATM offering completed in May 2024 and proceeds from the exercise of warrants into common stock pursuant to the Warrant Inducement Transaction in July 2024. 

Net cash used in discontinued operations was 861,576 and 1,293,359 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was 893,576 and 1,046,745 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. This change primarily relates to changes in working capital. Net cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations was 32,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was 246,614 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Plan of Financing; Going Concern 

We have incurred significant and recurring losses from operations for the past several years and, as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of 178,256,677. We had cash and cash equivalents of 3,078,955 as of September 30, 2024, and need to raise significant additional capital to meet our operating needs. We had short-term obligations of 3,816,766 and long-term operating lease obligations of 1,704,453 as of September 30, 2024. We do not expect to generate sufficient operating revenue to sustain our operations in the near term. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred negative cash flows from continuing operating activities of 8,913,589. Although we have attempted to improve our cash flows from continuing operating activities by bolstering revenues and continue to seek ways to generate revenue through business development activities, there is no guarantee that we will be able to improve our cash flows from continuing operating activities sufficiently or achieve profitability in the near term. As a result of these conditions, substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are issued. 

We are evaluating alternatives to obtain the required additional funding to maintain future operations. These alternatives may include, but are not limited to, equity financing, issuing debt, entering into other financing arrangements, or monetizing operating businesses or assets. These possibilities, to the extent available, may be on terms that result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders or that result in our existing stockholders losing part or all of their investment. Despite these potential sources of funding, we may be unable to access financing or obtain additional liquidity when needed or under acceptable terms, if at all. If such financing or adequate funds from operations are not available, we would be forced to limit our business activities and we could default on existing payment obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and may ultimately be required to cease our operations and liquidate our business. Our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

26

Financing Transactions 

We have primarily funded our operations through a combination of debt and equity instruments including short-term borrowings, and a variety of debt and equity offerings. We have no off-balance sheet transactions. 

On May 3, 2024, the Company entered into an ATM Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright ), to sell shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share (the Shares ), having an aggregate sales price of up to 3,696,000, from time to time, through an at the market offering program pursuant to which Wainwright acted as sales agent. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, Wainwright was permitted to sell the Shares by methods deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Under the Sales Agreement, Wainwright was entitled to compensation for its services of 3.0 of the gross sales price of all shares sold through Wainwright under the Sales Agreement. As of June 30, 2024, the Company sold 1,607,100 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately 2.30 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 3,696,000. No further shares are available to be sold under the Sales Agreement. 

On July 25, 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements with certain of its existing warrant holders for the exercise of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 958,117 shares of its common stock having a current exercise price of 14.00 originally issued in February 2021, June 2021 and May 2022, at a reduced exercise price of 1.32 per share. The gross proceeds to the Company from the exercise of the existing warrants were approximately 1,265,000, prior to deducting placement agent fees and transaction expenses payable by the Company. 

In consideration for the immediate cash exercise of the warrants, the Company concurrently issued to the warrant holders new unregistered Series A warrants to purchase up to 958,117 shares of common stock (the Series A Warrants and new Series B warrants to purchase up to 958,117 shares of common stock (the Series B Warrants ). The Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants have an exercise price of 1.07 per share and are exercisable immediately upon issuance. The Series A Warrants have a term equal to five years from the date of issuance, and the Series B Warrants have a term equal to 18 months from the date of issuance. 

The transactions described above closed on July 26, 2024. Wainwright acted as the exclusive placement agent for the above-mentioned transactions. The Company paid Wainwright as consideration (i) an aggregate cash fee equal to 7.0 of the gross proceeds from the exercise of the existing warrants, (ii) a management fee equal to 1.0 of the aggregate gross proceeds from the exercise of the existing warrants, (iii) 35,000 for expenses, and (iv) 15,950 for clearing fees. Additionally, the Company issued to Wainwright (or its designees) as compensation, warrants to purchase up to 67,068 shares of common stock of the Company (equal to 7.0 of the aggregate number of existing warrants exercised in the offering) (the Placement Agent Warrants ). The Placement Agent Warrants have a term of five years from the closing of the offering and an exercise price of 1.65 per share. 

There were no financing transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), defines the term disclosure controls and procedures as those controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

27

Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In the ordinary course of business, we may periodically become subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with ongoing business activities from time to time. The results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable resolutions are possible and could materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation could have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management attention and resources and other factors. 

Based on information readily available, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there are no pending legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, are likely to result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our risk factors from those disclosed under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. 

In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the reader should carefully consider the risks included in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, before making an investment decision. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no sales of our securities that were not registered under the Securities Act, other than those previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2024.
