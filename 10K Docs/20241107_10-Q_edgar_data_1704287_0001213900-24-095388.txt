CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

We make forward-looking statements
under the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other sections
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q ). In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking
words such as may, might, should, would, could, expect, 
 plan, anticipate, intend, believe, estimate, predict, 
 potential or continue, and the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking
statements, which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future
financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based
on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level
of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed
or implied by the forward-looking statements. 

While we believe we have
identified material risks, these risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-Q may describe additional
factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing
environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor
can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 

Although we believe the expectations
reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements.
Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking
statements after the date of this Form 10-Q to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations, and we do not intend
to do so. 

We caution you not to place
undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q in the case of forward-looking statements
contained in this Form 10-Q. 

You should not rely upon
forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those
indicated in the forward-looking statements. We qualify all our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Although we
believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of
activity, performance or achievements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of the forward-looking statements. In addition, with respect
to all our forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

, and that the market value of our publicly held securities be at
least million. 

On February 28, 2024, we received a notification
letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying us that the closing
bid price for our common stock had been below for the previous 30 consecutive business days and that we therefore are not in compliance
with the minimum bid price requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The
notification has no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

On August 28, 2024, at the Company s request,
Nasdaq s Listing Qualifications Staff notified the Company that it has extended the time for the Company to regain compliance with
the minimum bid price requirement until February 24, 2025. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at
least or higher for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, and in such case, Nasdaq will provide us with written confirmation
of compliance. If we are not able to cure the deficiency during this compliance period, Nasdaq will provide written notice to us that
our common stock will be subject to delisting. In the event of such delisting notification, we may appeal Nasdaq s determination
to delist our securities, but there can be no assurance that Nasdaq would grant our request for continued listing . 

We intend to take all reasonable measures available
to us to achieve compliance to allow for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, there can be no assurance that we will
be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise comply with other Nasdaq listing criteria. On June
20, 2024, we effected a reverse stock split of our shares of common stock at a ratio of , however, our common stock did not remain
above a trading price of following such reverse stock split. If our common stock does not regain compliance with the minimum price
requirement during the remaining compliance period, we may need to effect a further reverse stock split, whereby shares of our common
stock are further consolidated with the intent that the per-share trading price becomes greater than per share on a sustained basis
sufficient to regain compliance with the applicable Nasdaq requirements. On October 23, 2024, at a special meeting of stockholders, the
Company s stockholders approved a proposed amendment to the The Company s board of directors is considering whether to proceed with implementation of the reverse stock split, including the
timing and ratio thereof. 

As of the close of business on November 4, 2024,
the market value of our publicly held common stock (which is our only outstanding class of securities) was approximately million,
and the most recent closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was per share. If the market value of our publicly
held common stock declines below million, or the closing price of our common stock declines to per share or less for consecutive
trading days, we would also be subject to Nasdaq delisting proceedings on that basis. Nasdaq s staff also maintains discretionary
authority under its listing rules to delist companies whose capital structure or public offerings raise public interest and investor protection
concerns, including as a result of highly dilutive issuances, and it is possible that Nasdaq could assert that past offerings that we
have consummated, or future offerings we may consummate, raise such concerns. 

If our common stock is delisted, we may seek to
have our common stock quoted on an over-the-counter marketplace, such as on the OTCQX. The OTCQX is not a stock exchange, and if our common
stock trades on the OTCQX rather than a securities exchange, there may be significantly less trading volume and analyst coverage of, and
significantly less investor interest in, our common stock, which may lead to lower trading prices for our common stock. 

7 

million, and current
liabilities of approximately million. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company s net cash used in
operating activities was approximately million. The future viability of the Company is largely dependent on its ability to raise
additional capital to finance its operations. The Company expects that it will need to raise additional capital within the next twelve
months to continue its operations as the current cash resources will be sufficient to fund its operations through the first quarter of
2025. Although the Company has been able to raise capital in the past, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining additional
financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In addition, recent fundraising by the Company has resulted in significant ownership
dilution to shareholders, and given the Company s current market capitalization and financing needs, it is likely that future fundraising
may also be highly dilutive. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, it may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and
development program, product development or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects. 

Accordingly, based on the considerations discussed
above, management has concluded there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within after the date these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company plans to continue to fundraise. If adequate
funds are not available, the Company may require further steps to slow cash burn, extending the cash runway until financing can be secured.
These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments with respect to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
and their classification that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

country-by-country basis. The New Toray License Agreement contemplates that applicable royalty payment obligations from the Company to
Toray for other products will be determined separately by the parties in the future. There were no sales of or revenues from the cartridges

Toray is manufacturing (through its wholly owned subsidiary Kamakura Techno- Science, Inc.) certain product intermediate components for
use in cartridges being manufactured for the Company by Sanyoseiko. These cartridges made using Toray intermediates are for the purpose

2025, or the date that the Company obtains FDA approval for its product and may be extended for up to six months by mutual agreements
of the parties. If FDA approval is obtained, Sanyoseiko will be required to manufacture the intermediates and cartridges under a separate
supply agreement between the Company and Sanyoseiko. 

There were no amounts accrued related
to the New Toray License Agreement at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You should read the following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current
expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed
in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere
in this Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

We are a clinical-stage medical diagnostics company
developing rapid tests using whole blood on our Symphony platform Symphony to improve patient outcomes in critical care
settings. Our Symphony technology platform is an exclusively licensed, patented system that consists of a mobile device and single-use
test cartridges that if cleared, authorized, or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ), can provide a solution
to a significant market need in the United States. Clinical trials indicate Symphony produces results in less than 20 minutes for intensive
care units and emergency rooms, where rapid and reliable results are required. 

Since inception we have incurred net losses from
operations each year and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of approximately 1.5
million and 6.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately 33.2
million as of September 30, 2024. 

As further described below under Liquidity
and Going Concern Uncertainty as of September 30, 2024, the Company possessed cash and cash equivalents of approximately 5.8 million,
while having current liabilities of approximately 1.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s net
cash used in operating activities was approximately 6.1 million. The Company expects that it will need to raise additional capital in
the next twelve months to continue as a going concern, and absent such funding, cash resources will be sufficient to fund its operations
only through the first quarter of 2025.

Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024
and 2023

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 0.6 million as compared to approximately 1.4 million for the same period in 2023.
The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a reduction in technology transfer efforts which offset increased
clinical trial expenses. We expect future research and development expenses to be focused on costs specifically associated with our clinical
trial program supporting our regulatory strategy, technology transfer efforts and any necessary manufacturing improvements. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 0.8 million as compared to approximately 1.0 million for the comparable period in
2023. The minor decrease in general and administrative expenses is due to continued efforts to preserve capital by limiting our investment
in infrastructure and reducing professional services commensurate with our commercialization timeline. We expect to monitor and continue
to pare our general and administrative spend, as necessary, to optimize operational alignment. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 were 753 as compared to (19,619) for the comparable period in 2023. The low sales and marketing expenses
in 2024 are due to a reduction in spending in all sales and marketing efforts and the negative 2023 amount is related to the cancellation
and forfeiture of equity awards by terminated personnel. 

Other Income (expense), net 

Other income (expense), net for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, was (120,352) of expense as compared to 43,235 of income for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in other
income (expense), was primarily due to higher interest expense incurred associated with our notes payable under the Bridge Note Financing. 

Liquidity and Going Concern Uncertainty 

Our operations to date have been funded primarily
through equity financings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 5.8 million and current
liabilities of approximately 1.0 million. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company s net cash used in
operating activities was approximately 6.1 million. The future viability of the Company is largely dependent on its ability to raise
additional capital to finance its operations. The Company expects that it will need to raise additional capital within the next twelve
months to continue its operations as the current, cash resources will be sufficient to fund its operations through the first quarter of
2025. Although the Company has been able to raise capital in the past, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining additional
financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In addition, recent fundraising by the Company has resulted in very high ownership
dilution to shareholders, and given the Company s current market capitalization and financing needs, it is likely that future fundraising
may also be highly dilutive. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its
research and development program, product development or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects. 

We continue to develop the Symphony device and
its first test for the measurement of IL-6, including conducting clinical trials to obtain additional data to support a submission to
obtain FDA clearance of the Symphony device. However, our ability to continue these activities and continue operations (over the next
twelve months) is dependent on the Company obtaining additional capital. If we fail to obtain additional financing within twelve months,
we could be forced to abandon such activities entirely, with the possible loss of such properties or assets. 

There can be no assurance that such additional
capital will be available on a timely basis or on acceptable terms. We currently do not have any contracts or commitments for additional
financing. In addition, any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to the Company s existing stockholders.

Net cash used in operating activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we used approximately 6.1 million in cash for operating activities, an increase of approximately 545,000 as compared to the same period
in 2023. The increase is primarily driven by the timing of payments made by the Company to their vendors when comparing the two periods. 

Net cash used in investing activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we used approximately 306,000 in cash for investing activities, a decrease of approximately 311,000 as compared to the same period in
2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was due to limited purchasing of manufacturing equipment. 

Net cash provided by financing activities 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we raised approximately 9.9 million in cash through financing activities, an increase of approximately 8.8 million as compared to the
same period in 2023. The increase in net cash generated by financing activities was due our public offering on January 2, 2024, the Bridge
Note Financing in June 2024 and our public offering on June 28, 2024 as compared to our private placement of common stock in August 2023. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 

See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements (under
the caption Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ). 

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

We are an emerging growth company, as defined
in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act ). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting
new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private
companies. We elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different
effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or
(ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these condensed consolidated
financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company
effective dates. We are using the extended transition period for any other new or revised accounting standards during the period in which
we remain an emerging growth company. 

We will remain an emerging growth company until
the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of IPO (November 2021),
(b) in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least 1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer,
which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30 th 
and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

We are also a smaller reporting company, 
meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million and our annual revenue is less than 100 million
during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our
stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed
fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company
at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that
are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most
recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller
reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 

20 

JOBS Act Accounting Election 

The JOBS Act provides that an emerging
growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay
the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected
not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant
dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. 

We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements
that are in effect and may impact our financial statements and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements
that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as Amended (the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the
information required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We conducted an evaluation under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer), regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our President and
Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. We continue to
review our disclosure controls and procedures and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and ensuring
that our systems evolve with our Company s business. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September
30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

21 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time in the ordinary course of our
business, we may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The results of litigation are inherently
unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant
amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range
of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters for which losses are not probable and estimable. We have insurance policies covering
potential losses where such coverage is cost effective. 

We are not at this time involved in any legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

For a discussion of potential risks or uncertainties,
see Risk Factors in the Company s 2023 annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The following disclosures
supplement such Risk Factors, and should be read in conjunction therewith: 

Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements 

We have incurred significant losses since
our inception, do not currently generate any operating income, and will continue to incur losses as we work to obtain product approval,
and thus we may never achieve or maintain profitability. 

We incurred substantial losses of approximately
 10.0 million and 9.3 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, and approximately 6.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, and from our inception through September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 33.2 million. We
do not currently generate any operating income. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 5.8 million,
and current liabilities of approximately 1.0 million. We expect that our net cash used in operating activities will continue to be negative
as we continue to conduct clinical trial work and, if such trials are successful, begin preparation of an FDA submission. These raise
substantial doubt with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects that it will need to raise additional
capital to continue to fund its operations, and absent such funding, it will likely run out of available cash resources in the first quarter
of 2025. If we are unable to obtain such financing, or otherwise consummate strategic alternatives, we may be required to further delay
our FDA regulatory strategy, and to delay or reduce the scope of our clinical trials, research or development programs, commercialization
efforts or manufacturing commitments and capacity. Such inability to obtain additional financing when needed could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects. 

Our failure to become and remain profitable could
depress the value of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts,
or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our common stock could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment. 

22 

The report of our independent registered public
accounting firm on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included an emphasis of matter paragraph stating that
our recurring losses from operations and continued cash outflows from operating activities raised substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this going concern uncertainty and have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue to operate
as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to liquidate our assets which would have an adverse impact on our business
and developmental activities. In such a scenario, the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly
lower than the values reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern
statement by our independent registered public accounting firm and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially
adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise new capital. 

We will need to raise additional funding to fund our working
capital needs. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. 

Failure to obtain additional capital may force us to limit or
terminate our operations. 

We expect that the net proceeds of the public
offering we consummated in June 2024 will not be sufficient for us to fund the working capital needs of our business beyond first quarter
of 2025. We intend to continue to seek funds through equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources,
or through other sources of financing. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds
are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to further delay our FDA regulatory strategy, and to delay
or reduce the scope of our clinical trials, research or development programs, commercialization efforts or manufacturing commitments and
capacity. Such inability to obtain additional financing when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
cash flow, financial condition and prospects. 

Risks Related to Product Development and Regulatory Approval 

Ongoing materials, manufacturing and quality control issues could
negatively affect our timeline for the FDA submission of Symphony. 

We are experiencing a limited supply of critical
materials, manufacturing and quality control issues for our test cartridges that, until addressed, will negatively affect our timeline
for the FDA submission of Symphony. We are working with Toray, our licensing and cartridge intermediate supplier, to address these issues.
In particular, several individual components in our product may need to be replaced or validated due to limited supply or discontinuation
(including the antibody used in the product). In addition, we are working to correct several other accuracy and precision issues related
to the manufacturing of the Symphony product (including related to shelf-life stability). At the present time, we expect that these issues
will likely delay our ability to complete the testing, and that they will prevent us from submitting an FDA application within the next 18 months. 

Our ability to engage in and complete the
activities needed for an FDA submission will be contingent upon us addressing these and other challenges, including possessing
and/or raising sufficient capital, remaining a going concern, and producing product capable of supporting our product requirements
and meeting analytical validation, clinical validation. The delays described above delay, coupled with our lack of cash resources,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Our Recently Completed Public
Offering 

Sales of substantial amounts of our securities in the public
market could depress the market price of our common stock. 

Our common stock is listed for trading on the
Nasdaq Capital Market. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including the shares of
common stock issuable upon the exercise of the June 2024 Prefunded Warrants, Class C Warrants and Class D Warrants issued in the public
offering that we consummated in June 2024, and shares issued as consideration in any future acquisitions, or the market perceives that
such sales may occur, the market price of our securities could fall and we may be unable to sell our securities in the future. 

Although our common stock is listed on the
Nasdaq Capital Market, the exchange could subsequently delist our common stock if we fail to comply with ongoing listing standards. 

Our common stock currently is listed for quotation
on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We are required to meet specified financial requirements in order to maintain such listing, including a
requirement that the bid price for our common stock remain above 1.00, and that the market value of our publicly held securities be at
least 1 million. 

23 

On February 28, 2024, we received a notification
letter from the Nasdaq s Listing Qualifications Staff notifying us that the closing bid price for our common stock had been below
 1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive business days and that we therefore are not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement
for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notification has no immediate effect on
the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

On August 28, 2024, at the Company s request,
Nasdaq s Listing Qualifications Staff notified the Company that it has extended the time for the Company to regain compliance with
the minimum bid price requirement until February 24, 2025. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at
least 1.00 or higher for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, and in such case, Nasdaq will provide us with written confirmation
of compliance. If we are not able to cure the deficiency during this compliance period, Nasdaq will provide written notice to us that
our common stock will be subject to delisting. In the event of such notification, we may appeal Nasdaq s determination to delist
its securities, but there can be no assurance that Nasdaq would grant our request for continued listing. 

We intend to take all reasonable measures available
to us to achieve compliance to allow for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. However, there can be no assurance that we will
be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria.
On June 20, 2024, we effected a reverse stock split of our shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-8, however, our common stock did
not remain above a trading price of 1.00 following such reverse stock split. If our common stock does not regain compliance with the
minimum price requirement during the remaining compliance period, we may need to affect a further reverse stock split with the intent
that the per-share trading price becomes greater than 1.00 per share on a sustained basis sufficient to regain compliance with the applicable
Nasdaq requirements. On October 23, 2024, at a special meeting of stockholders, the Company s stockholders approved a proposed amendment
to the Company s certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s outstanding shares of common
stock by one of several fixed ratios (1-for-20, 1-for 25, 1-for-30, 1-for-35, 1-for-40, 1-for-45 and 1-for-50). The Company s board of directors is considering whether to proceed with implementation of the reverse stock split, including the
timing and ratio thereof. 

As of the close of business on November 4, 2024,
the market value of our publicly held common stock (which is our only outstanding class of capital stock) was approximately 2.0 million,
and the most recent closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was 0.729 per share. If the market value of our publicly
held common stock declines below 1 million, or the closing price of our common stock declines to 0.10 per share or less for 10 consecutive
trading days, we would also be subject to Nasdaq delisting proceedings on that basis. Nasdaq s staff also maintains discretionary
authority under its listing rules to delist companies whose capital structure or public offerings raise public interest and investor protection
concerns, including as a result of highly dilutive issuances, and it is possible that Nasdaq could assert that past offerings that we
have consummated, or future offerings we may consummate, raise such concerns. 

If our common stock is delisted, we may seek to
have our common stock quoted on an over-the-counter marketplace, such as on the OTCQX. The OTCQX is not a stock exchange, and if our common
stock trades on the OTCQX rather than a securities exchange, there may be significantly less trading volume and analyst coverage of, and
significantly less investor interest in, our common stock, which may lead to lower trading prices for our common stock 

Any potential delisting of our common stock from
the Nasdaq Capital Market may have materially adverse consequences to our stockholders, including: 

a reduced market price and liquidity with respect
to our shares of common stock, which could make our ability to raise new investment capital more difficult; 

limited dissemination of the market price of
our common stock; 

limited news coverage; 

limited interest by investors in our common stock; 

volatility of the prices of our common stock,
due to low trading volume; 

our common stock being considered a penny
stock, which would result in broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock being subject to the regulations set forth
in Rules 15g-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; 

increased difficulty in selling our common stock
in certain states due to blue sky restrictions; and 

limited ability to issue additional securities
or to secure additional financing. 

24 

Provisions of the Class C Warrants we sold
in June 2024, as well as the previously issued August 2023 Warrants and January 2024 Warrants, could discourage an acquisition of us by
a third-party. 

Certain provisions of the Class C Warrants and
Class D Warrants we sold in June 2024, as well as the August 2023 Warrants and January 2024 Warrants, could make it more difficult or
expensive for a third-party to acquire us. The Class C Warrants, August 2023 Warrants and January 2024 Warrants each prohibit us from
engaging in certain transactions constituting fundamental transactions unless, among other things, the surviving entity
assumes our obligations under the applicable warrants. These and other provisions of the Class C Warrants, August 2023 Warrants and January
2024 Warrants could prevent or deter a third-party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to you. 

The Class C Warrants may have an adverse
effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to affect a business combination. 

To the extent we issue shares of common stock
to affect a future business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of common stock upon
exercise of the Class C Warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business. Such Class C Warrants,
when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock and reduce the value of the shares issued to
complete the business combination. Accordingly, the Class C Warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or
increase the cost of acquiring a target business. Additionally, the sale, or even the possibility of a sale, of the shares of common stock
underlying the Class C Warrants could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future
financing. If and to the extent the Class C Warrants are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.
