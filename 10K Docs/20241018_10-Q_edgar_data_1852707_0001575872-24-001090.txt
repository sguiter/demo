Our Latin American Collection

Expanding our product range is another key aspect of our growth strategy. This summer, we aim to diversify our offerings by introducing the Latin American LatAm) Collection. This exciting addition to our product line will include a variety of certified Fair-Trade, Kosher, Organic, 100 Arabica premium coffee blends, such as Light, Medium, Dark, Espresso, and Swiss Water Decaf. These options will be available in whole bean, ground, and K-Cup-style formats, catering to different brewing preferences.

Sourcing and Manufacturing

We insist on ethically sourced coffee, focusing on sustainable cultivation, manufacturing, and production whenever possible. To ensure product consistency, quality, and redundancy in our manufacturing, our coffee beans are roasted in Ohio and Massachusetts, and we plan to roast and manufacture in Ohio and Colorado.

Growth Capital

We follow a long-term strategic model that aligns with a pr ove
n strategy that other premium and private coffee brands follow. The model assumes we raise 4 million of growth capital to buy green coffee beans, packaging, and manufacturing at a commercial scale to lower the per-unit costs. Additionally, the capital will fund our operations, retire maturing debt, and implement a comprehensive multichannel marketing strategy. This strategy will allocate approximately 25 of our gross revenue to advertising and marketing efforts in the next few years. We plan to gradually reduce this allocation to 21 as we progress. Our marketing plan is designed to effectively promote our products, drive sales, and solidify our market share via an aggressive 360 marketing approach, including Social Media Marketing, Search Engine Optimization SEO), Pay-Per-Click Advertising, Amazon Advertising, Optimization, Targeted Email Campaigns, Geofencing Marketing, Trade Shows, Event Marketing, Narrowcast video, and Satellite Radio. Our priority throughout our marketing efforts will be data-driven decision-making. By closely monitoring the performance of each marketing channel and analyzing return on investment ROI) data, we can make informed adjustments to our spending and campaign strategies. We aim to drive sales and maximize our reach within our target wellness demographic through targeted and optimized marketing techniques.

Sales Organization and Team Structure

To expand sales in brick-and-mortar grocers and retailers, we have retained a seasoned national coffee sales director who brings vast contacts of grocery and retail beverage directors and brokers. They are paid on an hourly project-based consultancy basis to help us build a network of stores within six hours of Columbus, Ohio, to minimize transit costs. The Sales Director reports directly to the Chief Operating Officer (COO), and we plan to add one Sales/Customer Service Representative for the first two years of full funding. In the third year, after full funding, we plan to add three additional Sales/Customer Service Representatives and a Director of Amenities to work directly with the hospitality market (i.e., Resorts/Hotels, etc.). To expand online sales, we have developed relationships with a network of vendors, starting with a Growth Manager who will report directly to the COO and help coordinate and manage the following: Amazon Manager, Brand Creative, Trade Marketing, Public Relations, Sales Strategy, Sales Action Plan. These online sales consultants will be paid from the funds raised on a project-by-project basis.

Performance and Result Measurement

We are in expansion discussions with numerous grocers, retailers, resorts, and hotels. We will measure performance results by the number of stores we sell and general revenue (projection to actual). After full funding of 4 million in growth capital within 12 months, we will seek sales in 251 stores and expect to generate over 1 million in year one. The following year, after full funding, we estimate sales in 770 stores and over 8 million in gross revenue to reach break-even/profitability within 20 months of full funding. We estimate sales in 1,770 stores, including Nespresso-style Pods, within year three to generate more than 24 million. By the fourth year, we project to be in over 2,700 stores, generating over 41 million in revenue. By the fifth year, we believe we could achieve sales in 4,000 stores and anticipate sales above 62 million.

Utilizing our DTC via our user-friendly website, GetSJCoffee.com, we estimate a 20 discount in our financial modeling of DTC purchases, inviting customers to indulge in our top-notch products. Furthermore, we have developed an enhanced subscription model that gives our loyal subscribers an exclusive up to 35 discount on their orders. This way, our customers can enjoy their favorite coffee blends while saving significantly.

Forecast

Assumption:

 Our financial projections assume we can raise 4 million in growth capital within 12 months. If we fail to do so, the forecasts will be subject to change.

Our competitive market analysis identified and intensely scrutinized ten synergistic publicly traded coffee companies. We examined each company's twelve trailing months TTM) of Revenue and Market Capitalization as of June 21, 2024. The analysis revealed an average Price-to-Sales ratio of 2.87. For our projected price-to-sale P/S), we applied a 20 reduction to establish a 2.29 P/S.

NOTE:

 Many reviewed companies have negative price-to-earnings; conversely, after funding, we project to break even by the 20th month and remain profitable for the foreseeable future.

 Market Data collected from Fidelity, WSJ.com, StockAnalysis.com, and Yahoo Finance as of the June 21, 2024, market close.

Our revenue projections and associated costs like cost of goods COGs) and operational expenses are meticulously calculated by leveraging Kroger's metrics and drawing on our collective experiences with manufacturing and distribution partners. The annual multiplication of revenue and price-to-sales ratios forms the basis for establishing a year-over-year projected market capitalization (i.e., revenue x P/S = market cap). Further, to estimate the Share Price, we divide the market cap by authorized shares, providing a projection for the share price (i.e., market cap / authorized shares = share price).

The graph below illustrates the results derived from this analysis. Please note that we have truncated the P/S decimal value in the graph for clarity and illustration purposes. These findings collectively underscore the potential trajectory and growth of our stock.
