 The Allowance for Credit Losses ("ACL") related to loans consists of loans evaluated collectively and individually for expected credit losses. The ACL related to loans represents an estimate of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loans as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to net loans. The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposure includes estimated losses on unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit and other off balance sheet credit exposures and is recorded in other liabilities. The total ACL is increased by charges to expense, through the provision for credit losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries.

Loan Modifications 
 
 On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty reported below do not include modifications with insignificant payment delays. ASU 2022-02 lists the following factors when considering if the loan modification has insignificant payment delays: (1) the amount of the restructured payments subject to the delay is insignificant relative to the unpaid principal or collateral value of the debt and will result in an insignificant shortfall in the contractual amount due, and (2) the delay in timing of the restructured payment period is insignificant relative to the frequency of payments due under the debt, the debt s original contractual maturity or the debt s original expected duration. 
 
 The ACL incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the ACL is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses a probability of default/loss given default model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. 
 
 Loans considered modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty amounted to and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Internal Credit Ratings 
 
 Management uses a ten point internal credit rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first categories are considered not criticized, and are aggregated as Pass rated. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The special mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are potentially weak, resulting in an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a substandard classification. Loans in the substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. All loans greater than days past due are evaluated for substandard classification. Loans in the doubtful category exhibit the same weaknesses found in the substandard loans; however, the weaknesses are more pronounced. Such loans are static and collection in full is improbable. However, these loans are not yet rated as loss because certain events may occur which would salvage the debt. Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and charge-off is imminent. 
 
 To help ensure that credit ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Banks have a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the pass category unless a specific action, such as bankruptcy, repossession, or death occurs to raise awareness of a possible credit event. An external semi-annual loan review of large commercial relationships is performed, as well as a sample of smaller transactions. The 2024 loan review will evaluate of the Banks' average outstanding commercial portfolio which can consist of outstanding loans, commercial real estate mortgages and outstanding commitments. Detailed reviews, including plans for resolution, are performed on loans classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss on a quarterly basis.

 The shift in allocation and the changes in the provision for credit losses are primarily due to changes in the credit metrics within the loan portfolio coupled with qualitative metric changes. The fluctuation in provision for consumer automobile loans was driven by the level of net charge-offs and economic outlook. The provision for residential real estate decreased due to the level of charge-offs/recoveries, strong credit metrics, and economic outlook. The level of provision for commercial, financial, and agricultural was primarily the result of net recoveries for the nine month period which influenced the default assumptions in the model. The provision for commercial real estate increased for the nine month period due to a loan relationship being moved to nonaccrual and being measured individually for impairment. The provision for real estate construction for the nine month period decreased due to a decrease in historical loss rates over the ten year look back period. 
 
 The shift in allocation for the 2023 periods were due to the changes in the provision for credit losses primarily due to changes in the credit metrics within the loan portfolio coupled with the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2023. The decrease in provision for consumer automobile loans for the three month period was driven by increased net recoveries that offset the impact of increased loan volume, while the increase in provision for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 was driven by loan volume coupled with increased net charge-offs. The increase in provision for commercial, financial, and agricultural for the three month period was primarily the result of loan volume, while the decrease in provision for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 was the result of improving credit metrics coupled with a large recovery during the three month period ended June 30, 2023 which effected the historical loss rate calculations. The provision for commercial real estate remained steady for the three month period and increased for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to growth within this segment of the loan portfolio. 
 
 The Company makes commercial, industrial, residential, and installment loans to customers primarily throughout north-east and central Pennsylvania. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its debtors ability to honor their contracts is dependent on the economic conditions within this region.

 The Company previously reported commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2023 of which primarily related to commercial relationships. The amounts shown above for September 30, 2024 include all loan categories, including retail and commercial loan relationships, and the December 31, 2023 amounts were revised to reflect comparable presentation. 
 
 Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to customers. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of fees. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company, on an extension of credit is based on management s credit assessment of the counterparty. 
 
 Standby letters of credit represent conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These instruments are issued primarily to support bid or performance related contracts. The coverage period for these instruments is typically a period with an annual renewal option subject to prior approval by management.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 EARNINGS SUMMARY 
 
 Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Summary Results 
 
 Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4,801,000 and 13,998,000, respectively, compared to 2,224,000 and 11,053,000 for the same periods of 2023. Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 were impacted by an increase in net interest income of 1,724,000 and 2,301,000, respectively, as the cost of funds has stabilized. The disposal of assets related to two former branch properties resulted in a one time after-tax loss of 261,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses was impacted for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by a provision for credit losses of 740,000 and a negative provision of 299,000, respectively, compared to provisions for credit losses of 1,372,000 and 263,000 for the 2023 periods. The recognition of a negative provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due primarily to recoveries during the second quarter of 2024 on a commercial loan. In addition, a minimal level of net loan charge-offs of 312,000 contributed to the recognition of the negative provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.64 and 1.86, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.31 and 1.56 basic and 1.53 diluted for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023. Annualized return on average assets was 0.86 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.41 for the corresponding period of 2023. Annualized return on average assets was 0.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.70 for the corresponding period of 2023. Annualized return on average equity was 9.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.06 for the corresponding period of 2023. Annualized return on average equity was 9.74 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.58 for the corresponding period of 2023. 
 
 Management uses the non-GAAP measure of net income from core operations in its analysis of the Company s performance. This measure, as used by the Company, adjusts net income by excluding significant gains or losses that are unusual in nature. Because certain of these items and their impact on the Company s performance are difficult to predict, management believes the presentation of financial measures excluding the impact of such items provides useful supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company s core businesses. For purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, net income from core operations means net income adjusted to exclude after-tax net securities gains or losses. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

 Interest and Dividend Income 
 
 Interest and dividend income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4,267,000 and 15,769,000, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. The increase in loan portfolio income was due to an increase in the average loan portfolio balance coupled with an increase in average rate earned on the portfolio as legacy loans matured and were replaced with loans at current higher rates and variable rate loans reset to higher rates. Investment securities income has been impacted primarily by an increase in the average rate earned on the portfolio as lower yielding legacy investments matured. The fluctuation in dividend and other interest income is due primarily to dividends received on FHLB restricted stock. 
 
 Interest and dividend income composition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2,543,000 and 13,468,000, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. Interest-bearing deposit interest expense increased significantly due a time deposit gathering campaign that generated funding for the increase in the loan portfolio. In addition, competition for deposits along with the impact of the rate environment contributed to the increase in deposit interest expense. Brokered deposits have also been utilized as a funding source to supplement in-market deposit gathering efforts and to reduce the utilization of short-term borrowings. Long-term borrowing interest expense increased as borrowings were utilized to fund a portion of the growth in the loan portfolio. 
 
 Interest expense composition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change (In Thousands) Amount Total Amount Total Amount Deposits 9,599 73.10 6,463 61.04 3,136 48.52 Short-term borrowings 932 7.10 2,412 22.78 (1,480) (61.36) Long-term borrowings 2,601 19.80 1,714 16.18 887 51.75 Total interest expense 13,132 100.00 10,589 100.00 2,543 24.02

 Net Interest Margin 
 
 The net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.88 and 2.79 respectively, compared to 2.65 and 2.82 for the corresponding periods of 2023. The increase in the net interest margin for the three month period was driven by an increase in the rate paid on interest-earning assets of 64 basis points ("bps"), while the decrease in the net interest margin for the nine month period was driven by a 96 bps increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The overall increase in interest rates over the periods resulted in increases to both the yield on the earnings asset portfolio and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. Driving the increase in the yield and interest income on the earning assets portfolio was the repricing of legacy assets coupled with portfolio growth. The average loan portfolio balance increased 76,016,000 and 127,005,000, respectively, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 as the average yield on the portfolio increased 65 bps and 72 bps, resulting in an increase in taxable equivalent interest income of 3,927,000 and 14,475,000, for the periods. The three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 were impacted by an increase of 55 bps and 70 bps in the yield earned on the securities portfolio as legacy securities matured with the funds reinvested at higher rates, which resulted in an increase in taxable equivalent interest income of 343,000 and 1,240,000, respectively. Short-term borrowings decreased in volume, which offset the impact of an increase in rate paid, resulting in a decrease of 1,480,000 and 2,060,000 in expense for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 76 bps and 116 bps, respectively, or 3,136,000 and 11,753,000 in expense, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods of 2023 due to the rate environment, an increase in competition for deposits, and a migration of deposit balances from core deposits to higher rate time deposits. The rates paid on time deposits significantly contributed to the increase in funding costs as rates paid for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 increased 70 bps and 114 bps, respectively, or 2,157,000 and 8,194,000 in expense, as deposit gathering campaigns continued to focus on time deposits with a maturity of five months. In addition, brokered deposits have been utilized to assist with funding the loan portfolio growth and contributed to the increase in time deposit funding costs, while lowering the reliance on higher cost short-term borrowings.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 The provision for credit losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio. The purpose of the review is to assess loan quality, identify impaired loans, analyze delinquencies, ascertain loan growth, evaluate potential charge-offs and recoveries, and assess general economic conditions in the markets served. An external independent loan review is also performed annually for the Banks. Management remains committed to an aggressive program of problem loan identification and resolution. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is determined by applying loss factors to outstanding loans by type. A historical charge-off factor is calculated utilizing the charge-off and recovery data over the past ten years. Management has identified a number of additional qualitative factors which it uses to supplement the historical charge-off factor because these factors are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing loan pools to differ from historical loss experience. 
 
 Although management believes it uses the best information available to make such determinations and that the allowance for credit losses is adequate at September 30, 2024, future adjustments could be necessary if circumstances or economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations. A downturn in the local economy, increased unemployment, and delays in receiving financial information from borrowers could result in increased levels of nonperforming assets, charge-offs, loan loss provisions, and reductions in income. Additionally, as an integral part of the examination process, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Banks' loan loss allowance. The banking agencies could require the recognition of additions to the loan loss allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 
 When determining the appropriate allowance level, management has attributed the allowance for credit losses to various portfolio segments; however, the allowance is available for the entire portfolio as needed. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses increased from 11,446,000 at December 31, 2023 to 11,588,000 at September 30, 2024. The slight increase in allowance was due primarily to loan portfolio growth, net charge-offs of 312,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the impact of a loan relationship that was moved to nonaccrual status and is being measured individually for impairment. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses to total loans was 0.62 and 0.62 , respectively.

Table of Contents 

The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 had a provision for credit losses of 740,000 and a negative provision of 299,000, respectively, compared to provisions for credit losses of 1,372,000 and 263,000 for the 2023 periods. The recognition of a negative provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is due primarily to recoveries during the second quarter of 2024 on a commercial loan which impacted the expected default assumption for that segment. In addition, a minimal level of loan charge-offs of 312,000 contributed to the recognition of the negative provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Nonperforming loans increased to 7,940,000 at September 30, 2024 from 3,148,000 at December 31, 2023. The majority of nonperforming loans involve loans that are either in a secured position and have sureties with a strong underlying financial position or have been individually evaluated for impairment and have a specific allocation recorded within the allowance for credit losses. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans ratio increased to 0.42 at September 30, 2024 from 0.17 at December 31, 2023 and 0.20 at September 30, 2023. Net loan charge-offs of 312,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 impacted the allowance for credit losses, which was 0.62 of total loans at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 compared to 0.71 at September 30, 2023.

 Non-interest Income 
 
 Total non-interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 increased 546,000 and 754,000, respectively. Excluding net securities losses, non-interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 429,000 and increased 610,000 compared to the same periods in 2023. Gain on sale of loans and loan broker commissions increased for the three and nine month periods as the volume of loan sales has increased due to an uptick in mortgage activity. The changes in bank-owned life insurance revenue for the three and nine month periods was primarily due to difference in gain on death benefits. Other income primarily increased for the nine month period due to the recognition of a gain on extinguishment of debt. 
 
 Non-interest income composition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows:

 Non-interest Expense 
 
 Total non-interest expense decreased 288,000 and increased 5,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023. The increase in salaries and employee benefits is attributable to routine annual wage increases and an increase in health insurance costs. Furniture and equipment expenses in addition to occupancy expenses have been impacted by expected changes in maintenance, utilities, and depreciation with the three and nine month periods decreasing due to the disposal of a former branch location and a relocation of a second location during the first quarter of 2024. Software amortization increased due to increased software licensing costs and investment in additional automated systems. Marketing costs decreased as print advertising has been limited while emphasis has been placed on social media marketing efforts. Pennsylvania shares tax increased as the taxable base increased. Professional fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in legal fees. FDIC insurance expense fluctuated due to changes in the assessment rate and base. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 had a loss on sale of premise and equipment related to the exit of two branch location leases.

Investments 
 
 The fair value of the investment debt securities portfolio at September 30, 2024 increased 6,521,000 since December 31, 2023, while the amortized cost of the portfolio increased 1,679,000. The increase in the investment portfolio amortized value occurred within the mortgage-backed segment of the portfolio as principal cash flow from other portfolio segments was reinvested into mortgage-backed securities to provide future cash flow. The portfolio continues to be actively managed in order to reduce interest rate and market risk. The unrealized losses within the debt securities portfolio are the result of market activity, not credit issues/ratings, as approximately 79.13 of the debt securities portfolio on an amortized cost basis is currently rated A or higher by either S P or Moody s. 
 
 The Company considers various factors, which include examples from applicable accounting guidance, when analyzing the available for sale portfolio for possible other than temporary impairment. The Company primarily considers the following factors in its analysis: severity of the fair value being less than carrying value; reduction of dividend paid (equities); continued payment of dividend/interest, credit rating, and financial condition of an issuer; intent and ability to hold until anticipated recovery (which may be maturity); and general outlook for the economy, specific industry, and entity in question. 
 
 The bond portion of the portfolio review is conducted with emphases on several factors. Continued payment of principal and interest is given primary importance with credit rating and financial condition of the issuer following as the next most important. Credit ratings were reviewed with the ratings of the bonds being satisfactory. Bonds that were not currently rated were discussed with a third party and/or underwent an internal financial review. Each bond is reviewed to determine whether it is a general obligation bond, which is backed by the credit and taxing power of the issuing jurisdiction, or a revenue bond, which is only payable from specified revenues. Based on the review undertaken by the Company, the Company determined that the decline in value of the various bond holdings were temporary and were the result of the general market downturns and interest rate/yield curve changes, not credit issues. The fact that almost all of such bonds are general obligation bonds further solidified the Company s determination that the decline in the value of these bond holdings is temporary. 
 
 The fair value of the equity portfolio continues to fluctuate as the economic and political environment continues to impact stock pricing. The amortized cost of the available for sale equity securities portfolio has remained flat at 1,300,000 for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 while the fair value increased 24,000 over the same time period.

Financing Activities 
 
 Deposits 
 
 Total deposits increased 110,828,000 from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Time deposits increased 68,227,000 over this period to a total of 328,294,000 as deposit gathering efforts focused on time deposits as customers sought a higher return on their deposit balances. Brokered deposits increased by 42,927,000 as usage provided an alternative to FHLB borrowings and supplemented funding for loan portfolio growth. Core deposits (deposits less time deposits) remained stable as growth in money market deposits offset the flow of deposit balances from noninterest-bearing and lower rate products into higher rate time deposit accounts. Money market deposits increased primarily as customers moved deposit balances into this deposit product from noninterest-bearing and lower rate products in addition to increased balances from commercial customers. Emphasis has been on increasing the utilization of electronic (internet and mobile) deposit banking among our customers. Utilization of internet and mobile banking products has increased due to these efforts coupled with a change in consumer behavior over the past several years. 
 
 Deposit balances and their changes for the periods being discussed follow:

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company had 451,304,000 and 436,074,000, respectively, in uninsured deposits. Included in the total uninsured deposits is a concentration of public funds which were collateralized by the Banks in the amount of 92,597,000 and 77,687,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total uninsured deposits less collateralized public funds was 358,707,000 at September 30, 2024 and 358,387,000 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Borrowed Funds 
 
 Total borrowed funds decreased 16.99 , or 67,711,000, to 330,813,000 at September 30, 2024 compared to 398,524,000 at December 31, 2023. Long term borrowings remained constant as matured borrowings were replaced with fixed rate borrowings in order to lock in interest rates and to provide matched funding for segments of the loan portfolio. Short term FHLB borrowings were utilized to provide short term funding for the loan portfolio growth and decreased as deposit growth lessened the need for short term borrowings. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase have decreased as customers balances have decreased.

 Capital 
 
 Federal regulations require the Company and the Banks to maintain minimum amounts of capital. Specifically, each is required to maintain certain minimum dollar amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1, Total, and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average total assets. 
 
 In addition to the capital requirements, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act FDICIA established five capital categories ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized. Should any institution fail to meet the requirements to be considered adequately capitalized, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the FDIC categorized the Banks as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be classified as a well capitalized financial institution, common equity tier I risk-based, tier I risked-based, total risk-based, and tier I leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.5 , 8 , 10 , and 5 , respectively. 
 
 We expect to continue to emphasize growth in our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, and additional regulatory capital generated through retained earnings and other sources will be necessary to support any such continued growth. At September 30, 2024, each of the Banks was well capitalized as defined by applicable bank regulatory standards. Applicable regulatory capital requirements also require each Bank to maintain a capital conservation buffer, consisting solely of tier 1 common equity, of 2.5 above the regulatory minimum capital requirements for each of the tier 1 common equity CET1 ), tier 1 Tier 1 ), and total capital Total Capital ratios. As a result of the capital conservation buffer requirements, if a bank does not maintain CET1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios of at least 7 , 8.5 , and 10.5 , respectively, determined as of the end of each calendar quarter, the bank s ability to make certain discretionary payments, including discretionary dividend payments, are subject to a maximum payout ratio limitation unless the FDIC approves the distribution or payment. At September 30, 2024, each of Banks exceeded the capital conservation buffer requirements for applicable capital ratios. 
 
 Capital ratios for the Company and each Bank (using the definitions from the prompt corrective action rules) are presented in the following tables, which shows that the Company and both Banks met all regulatory capital requirements.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had an active registered at-the-market offering pursuant to the terms of an equity distribution agreement, dated September 13, 2023 (the Distribution Agreement ), between D.A. Davidson Co. (the Distribution Agent and the Company. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Company will pay the Distribution Agent a fee in the amount of 2.75 of the gross proceeds from the sale of such shares. The Company did not sell any shares under the Distribution Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity; Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 
 
 The asset/liability committee addresses the liquidity needs of the Company to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet credit demands and deposit withdrawals as well as to the placement of available funds in the investment portfolio. In assessing liquidity requirements, equal consideration is given to the current position as well as the future outlook. 
 
 The following liquidity measures are monitored for compliance and were within the limits cited, with the exception of net loans to total deposits that was 110 , at September 30, 2024: 
 
 1. Net Loans to Total Assets, 85 maximum 
 2. Net Loans to Total Deposits, 100 maximum 
 3. Cumulative 90 day Maturity GAP , +/- 15 maximum 
 4. Cumulative 1 Year Maturity GAP , +/- 20 maximum 
 
 Fundamental objectives of the Company s asset/liability management process are to maintain adequate liquidity while minimizing interest rate risk. The maintenance of adequate liquidity provides the Company with the ability to meet its financial obligations to depositors, loan customers, and shareholders. Additionally, it provides funds for normal operating expenditures and business opportunities as they arise. The objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to increase net interest income by managing interest sensitive assets and liabilities in such a way that they can be repriced in response to changes in market interest rates. 
 
 The Banks, like other financial institutions, must have sufficient funds available to meet liquidity needs for deposit withdrawals, loan commitments and originations, and expenses. In order to control cash flow, the Banks estimate future cash flows from deposits, loan payments, and investment security payments. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest 
 44 

Table of Contents 

payments on loans and investment securities, FHLB borrowings, and brokered deposits. Management believes the Banks have adequate resources to meet their normal funding requirements. 
 
 Management monitors the Company s liquidity on both a long and short-term basis, thereby providing management necessary information to react to current balance sheet trends. Cash flow needs are assessed and sources of funds are determined. Funding strategies consider both customer needs and economical cost. Both short and long-term funding needs are addressed by maturities and sales of available for sale and trading investment securities, loan repayments and maturities, and liquidating money market investments such as federal funds sold. The use of these resources, in conjunction with access to credit, provides core funding to satisfy depositor, borrower, and creditor needs. 
 
 Management monitors and determines the desirable level of liquidity. Consideration is given to loan demand, investment opportunities, deposit pricing and growth potential, as well as the current cost of borrowing funds. The Company has a total current maximum borrowing capacity at the FHLB of 841,054,000. In addition to this credit arrangement, the Company has additional lines of credit with correspondent banks of 90,000,000. Management believes it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy estimated short-term and long-term funding needs. FHLB borrowings totaled 321,253,000 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest rate sensitivity, which is closely related to liquidity management, is a function of the repricing characteristics of the Company s portfolio of assets and liabilities. Asset/liability management strives to match maturities and rates between loan and investment security assets with the deposit liabilities and borrowings that fund them. Successful asset/liability management results in a balance sheet structure which can cope effectively with market rate fluctuations. The matching process segments both assets and liabilities into future time periods (usually 12 months, or less) based upon when repricing can be effected. Repriceable assets are subtracted from repriceable liabilities for a specific time period to determine the gap , or difference. Once known, the gap is managed based on predictions about future market interest rates. Intentional mismatching, or gapping, can enhance net interest income if market rates move as predicted. However, if market rates behave in a manner contrary to predictions, net interest income will suffer. Gaps, therefore, contain an element of risk and must be prudently managed. In addition to gap management, the Company has an asset/liability management policy which incorporates a market value at risk calculation which is used to determine the effects of interest rate movements on shareholders equity and a simulation analysis to monitor the effects of interest rate changes on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 The Company currently maintains a gap position of being asset sensitive. The Company has strategically taken this position as it has previously decreased the duration of the earning asset portfolio by adding quality short and intermediate term loans such as home equity loans. The Company has added certain longer-term earning assets due to the significant increase in interest rates. Lengthening of the liability portfolio, primarily time deposits, previously was undertaken to build protection during the current rate environment and has now shifted to a time deposit gathering campaign with an emphasis on five month maturities. 
 
 A market value at risk calculation is utilized to monitor the effects of interest rate changes on the Company s balance sheet and more specifically shareholders equity. The Company does not manage the balance sheet structure in order to maintain compliance with this calculation. The calculation serves as a guideline with greater emphasis placed on interest rate sensitivity. Changes to calculation results from period to period are reviewed as changes in results could be a signal of future events. As of the most recent analysis, the results of the market value at risk calculation were within established guidelines due to the strategic direction being taken. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 
 In this analysis the Company examines the result of a 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis point change in market interest rates and the effect on net interest income. It is assumed that the change is instantaneous and that all rates move in a parallel manner. Assumptions are also made concerning prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage securities. 
 
 The following is a rate shock forecast for the twelve month period ending September 30, 2025 assuming a static balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 Parallel Rate Shock in Basis Points (In Thousands) -300 -200 -100 Static +100 +200 +300 +400 Net interest income 59,906 61,399 62,878 64,267 65,525 66,726 67,546 67,640 Change from static (4,361) (2,868) (1,389) 1,258 2,459 3,279 3,373 Percent change from static -6.79 -4.46 -2.16 1.96 3.83 5.10 5.25

The model utilized to create the report presented above makes various estimates at each level of interest rate change regarding cash flow from principal repayment on loans and mortgage-backed securities and/or call activity on investment securities. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change. In addition, the limits stated above do not necessarily represent the level of change under which management would undertake specific measures to realign its portfolio in order to reduce the projected level of change. Generally, management believes the Company is well positioned to respond expeditiously when the market interest rate outlook changes. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities relate to banking activities and are monetary. The consolidated financial statements and related financial data are presented following GAAP. GAAP currently requires the Company to measure the financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars, except for securities available for sale, individually evaluated loans, and other real estate loans that are measured at fair value. Changes in the value of money due to rising inflation can cause purchasing power loss. 
 
 Management's opinion is that movements in interest rates affect the financial condition and results of operations to a greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation. It should be noted that interest rates and inflation do affect each other but do not always move in correlation with each other. The Company's ability to match the interest sensitivity of its financial assets to the interest sensitivity of its liabilities in its asset/liability management may tend to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on the Company's performance. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Market risk for the Company is comprised primarily of interest rate risk exposure and liquidity risk. Interest rate risk and liquidity risk management is performed at both the level of the Company and the Banks. The Company s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through selected interest rate risk measures produced by an independent third party. There have been no substantial changes in the Company s gap analysis or simulation analysis compared to the information provided in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023. Additional information and details are provided in the Liquidity, Interest Rate Sensitivity, and Market Risk section of Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of that document. 
 
 Generally, management believes the Company is well positioned to respond in a timely manner when the market interest rate outlook changes. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Certain risk factors are set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented as follows: 
 
 If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate earnings at current levels, our growth may be constrained and certain distributions, including discretionary dividend payments, by our subsidiary Banks to the holding company may be restricted. 
 
 We expect to continue to emphasize growth in our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, and additional regulatory capital generated through retained earnings and other sources will be necessary to support any such continued growth. At September 30, 2024, each of Jersey Shore State Bank and Luzerne Bank were well capitalized as defined by applicable bank regulatory standards. Applicable regulatory capital requirements also require each Bank to maintain a capital conservation buffer, consisting solely of tier 1 common equity, of 2.5 above the regulatory minimum capital requirements for each of the tier 1 common equity CET1 ), tier 1 Tier 1 ), and total capital Total Capital ratios. As a result of the capital conservation buffer requirements, if a bank does not maintain CET1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios of at least 7 , 8.5 , and 10.5 , respectively, determined as of the end of each calendar quarter, the bank s ability to make certain discretionary payments, including discretionary dividend payments, are subject to a maximum payout ratio limitation unless the FDIC approves the distribution or payment. At September 30, 2024, each of the Banks exceeded the capital conservation buffer requirements for the applicable capital ratios. If, however, we are unable to generate retained earnings or raise capital in amounts necessary to avoid limitations on discretionary dividend payments by the Banks, our continued growth could be adversely affected.
