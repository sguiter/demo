interest in a newly formed joint venture JV ), CG Converting and Packaging, LLC CGN ), with C.G. Laboratories Inc. CG Labs for its converting and packaging business. The JV is effective
March 1, 2023. As a result of this transaction, the Company owns of the JV, with the remaining held by CG Labs. 

On
January 6, 2023, the Company acquired a interest in a newly formed JV Enigma to pursue branded consumer product retail
opportunities and the development of new patch products. The JV agreement is effective January 6, 2023. As a result of this transaction,
the Company owns of the JV, with the remaining held by Moiety. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes of NexGel have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP for interim financial information and the instructions
to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary
for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations
to be anticipated for the full year ending December 31, 2024 . These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its condensed consolidated wholly-owned
subsidiary, NexGelRx, Inc. and the fifty percent owned JV s (see Note 5). 

million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred
a net loss of million and had a net usage of cash in operating activities of million. In addition, the Company had a
working capital of million as of September 30, 2024. 

On
November 11, 2024, the Company entered into subscription agreements with investors and certain members of its board of directors
and management for the sale by the Company of an aggregate of units at a price to the public of 
per unit, with each unit consisting of two shares of the Company s common stock, and a warrant to purchase one share of common
stock at an exercise price of 
per share (the November Financing ). The November Financing is expected to close on or about November 13, 2024 with
gross proceeds to the Company expected to be million, before deducting the placement agent s fees and other estimated
offering expenses payable by the Company, and excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants. The Company intends
to use the net proceeds from the RDO for working capital and for general corporate purposes (discussed further within Note
19). 

Management
is exploring new product channel sales in adjacent industries, such as cosmetics, athletic products, and proprietary medical devices.
The Company has increased focus on sales and developing a sales pipeline for potential customers. This customer base expansion will enable
us to provide financial stability for the foreseeable future, expand our current processes, and position us for long-term shareholder
value creation. 

We intend to maintain and attempt to
grow our existing contract manufacturing business. We also plan to continue building and developing our catalogue of consumer products
for sale to branding partners and to use our in-house capabilities to create and test market additional branded products. These products
will be target marketed and sold online through social media and online advertising and marketplaces. Furthermore, the Company plans
to develop its own proprietary medical devices and explore drug delivery programs for its technology. Additionally, the Company continues
to evaluate strategic initiatives (e.g., acquisitions) and additional capital raises through debt or equity may be necessary to achieve
these objectives. 

We
expect to continue incurring losses for the near-term future. Our ability to continue to operate as a going concern in the long-term
is dependent upon our ability to manage and grow our current products and to ultimately achieve profitable operations. Management may
consider various options to raise capital to fund potential acquisitions through equity or debt offerings. There can be no assurances,
however, that management will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds, if needed, or that such funds, if available, will be obtained
on terms satisfactory to us. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Additionally,
it is reasonably possible that estimates made in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been, or will be, materially and
adversely impacted in the near term as a result of these conditions, including the recoverability of long-lived assets. 

The

Granbury, Texas.

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any contract assets or contract liabilities from contracts with
customers and there were remaining performance obligations that the Company had not satisfied except for deferred revenue of 
and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, that the Company had not satisfied as of the end of the respective
period. 

The
Company has four distinct lines of business; Contract Manufacturing, Custom and White Label, Branded Consumer Products, and Medical Devices/Other. 

Contract
Manufacturing 

Customers
order rolls of gel rollstock ). The rollstock is shipped to our customers, which they package into finished goods. Historically,
this has been the Company s primary source of revenue. 

Custom
and White Label 

These
products often infuse various ingredients into our base gel to develop unique product offerings to satisfy market demand (e.g. aloe infused
into the gel for a beauty mask). The rollstock is converted and packaged into saleable units. The finished goods are shipped to the customer,
who is ultimately responsible for product distribution. Frequently these products started as development deals, in which the customer
paid the Company a small fee to develop a specific product. Once completed, the customer places a large order for newly developed product.
Custom and white label revenue is recognized upon delivery of the finished product. 

Branded
Consumer Products 

These
products are finished goods marketed and sold directly to the customer by the Company through online and retail channels. The Company
is responsible for sales, marketing, and distribution. When merchandise is shipped to a customer, our performance obligation is met,
and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. These products carry the Company s brand names, which include
Medagel, Lumagel Beauty, Kenkoderm and Silly George. 

Medical
Devices/Other 

Medical
Devices are a hybrid business, combining elements of Custom and White Label and Branded Consumer Products. Medical Devices, which are
not yet marketed, are expected to be distributed through strategic partnerships. The Company will manufacture and possibly convert/package
the device while the strategic partner brings the product to market. Small market Medical Devices could be launched by the Company, but
also be offered to a distributor to reach the full scale of the market. 

Other includes shipping and handling revenue from
customers who purchase the Company s branded consumer products through their Shopify stores. It also includes a small amount of
freight revenue from contract manufacturing customers. 

Shipping
and Handling Revenue and Expense 

Shipping
and handling revenue and expense are included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations in revenues and cost of revenues,
respectively. The Company accounts for shipping activities, consisting of direct costs to ship products performed after the control passes
to the customer. Shipping revenue and expense are primarily generated through the Amazon marketplace and Silly George direct customer
sales. 

The
2019 Plan provides certain employees, contractors, and outside directors with share-based compensation in the form of incentive stock
options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, dividend
equivalent rights and other awards. The fair values of incentive stock option award grants are estimated as of the date of grant using
a Black-Scholes option valuation model. Compensation expense is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. 

If
the Company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the onset of the collaboration, the collaboration is treated as
a business combination and the Company consolidates the financial statements of the VIE into the Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements. As of December 31, 2023, and on a quarterly basis thereafter, the Company will evaluate whether it continues to
be the primary beneficiary of the consolidated VIE. If the Company determines that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of a consolidated
VIE, it deconsolidates the VIE in the period in which the determination is made. 

Assets
and liabilities recorded as a result of consolidating the financial results of the VIE into the Company s condensed consolidated
balance sheet do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against the Company s general assets or liabilities
for which creditors have recourse to the Company s general assets.

or circumstances after the date on which any such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

Overview 

From 2019 through November 2023, we only
manufactured high water content, electron beam cross-linked, aqueous polymer hydrogels, or gels, used for wound care, medical diagnostics,
transdermal drug delivery and cosmetics. We specialize in custom gels by capitalizing on proprietary manufacturing technologies. We have
historically served as a contract manufacturer, supplying our gels to third parties who incorporate them into their own products. Beginning
in 2020, we created two new lines of business for the company. First, our own line of branded consumer products sold direct to consumers.
Second, we expanded into custom and white label opportunities, which focuses on combining our gels with proprietary branded products
and white label opportunities. All of our gel products are manufactured using proprietary and non-proprietary mixing, coating and cross-linking
technologies. Together, these technologies enable us to produce gels that can satisfy rigid tolerance specifications with respect to
a wide range of physical characteristics (e.g., thickness, water content, adherence, absorption, moisture vapor transmission rate [a
measure of the passage of water vapor through a substance] and release rate) while maintaining product integrity. Additionally, we have
the manufacturing ability to offer broad choices in the selection of liners onto which the gels are coated. Consequently, we and our
customers are able to determine tolerances in moisture vapor transmission rate and active ingredient release rates while personalizing
color and texture. 

On March 1, 2023, the Company acquired a 50 interest
in a newly formed JV for its converting and packaging business. The new JV expands the Company s offerings, allowing it to reach
more customers with a variety of gel shapes and sizes. The Company had limited converting and packaging operations in its Langhorne Facility,
making a JV to expand capacity an attractive opportunity. 

Beginning
in December 2023, the Company expanded their product portfolio to include the Kenkoderm brand. Kenkoderm is a skincare line focused
on reducing symptoms associated with psoriasis. Kenkoderm products do not utilize our gel technology and are manufactured by third
parties. This marks the first time the company expanded its product portfolio to include products unrelated to its core gel
technology. 

Beginning
in May 2024, the Company added the Silly George brand. Silly George is a beauty and cosmetics company focused on eyeliner, fake
eyelashes, lash serum and mascara. Similar to Kenkoderm, Silly George products are purchased and resold from third party
manufacturers. This second acquisition further expanded the Company s retail sales presence in products unrelated to its core
gel technology. 

Joint
Ventures 

CGN 

On
March 1, 2023, the Company acquired a 50 interest in its newly formed JV for its converting and packaging business. The JV agreement

50 of the JV, with the remaining 50 held by Moiety.

of Operations 

The
following sections discuss and analyze the changes in the significant line items in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements
of operations for the comparison periods identified. 

Comparison
of the Three Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 in thousands) 

Revenues,
net 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 revenues were 2,940 and increased by 1,719, or 140.8 , when compared to 1,221 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in our overall revenues was primarily due to sales growth in our branded consumer products,
including gross revenue from Silly George of 1,373 for the three months ending September 30, 2024, and partially offset by a decrease
in contract manufacturing. 

The
Company has four distinct lines of business; Contract Manufacturing, Custom and White Label, Branded Consumer Products, and Medical Devices. 

Contract
Manufacturing 

Customers
order rolls of gel rollstock ). The rollstock is shipped to our customers, which they package into finished goods. Historically,
this has been the Company s primary source of revenue. 

Custom
and White Label 

These
products often infuse various ingredients into our base gel to develop unique product offerings to satisfy market demand (e.g. aloe infused
into the gel for a beauty mask). The rollstock is converted and packaged into saleable units. The finished goods are shipped to the customer,
who is ultimately responsible for product distribution. Frequently these products started as development deals, in which the customer
paid the company a small fee to develop a specific product. Once completed, the customer places a large order for newly developed product. 

Branded
Consumer Products 

These
products are finished goods marketed and sold directly to the customer by the Company through online and retail channels. The Company
is responsible for sales, marketing, and distribution. These products carry the Company s brand names, which include Medagel, Lumagel
Beauty, Kenkoderm and Silly George. 

Medical
Devices/Other 

Medical
Devices are a hybrid business, combining elements of Custom and White Label and Branded Consumer Products. Medical Devices, which are
not yet marketed, are expected to be distributed through strategic partnerships. The Company will manufacture and possibly convert/package
the device while the strategic partner brings the product to market. Small market Medical Devices could be launched by the Company, but
also be offered to a distributor to reach the full scale of the market. 

Other
includes freight charged to customers who purchase the Company s branded consumer products through their Shopify stores. 

Gross
profit . Our gross profit was 1,282 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gross profit of 344 thousand
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 938 in gross profit quarter over quarter was primarily due to the increase
in branded consumer products. Gross profit was 43.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a gross profit of 28.2 
for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Net cash used in operating activities was 3,008 and 2,649 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 712 and net cash provided by investing activities was 4,729 for the nine months ended September

the Silly George acquisition of 400 for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisting of the sales of marketable securities of
 5,340 and purchases of capital equipment of 611 for nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,079 consisting of net proceeds from the February
Offering and August Offering of 1,950, an investment of 37 by a joint venture partner, and from the margin line of credit of 345,
offset by principal payments of notes payable of 36, a change in contingent consideration liability of 164, and by principal payment
on financing lease liability of 53. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable
to the proceeds from the margin line of credit of 89 thousand and principal payments of notes payable and convertible notes of 4. 

At
September 30, 2024, current assets totaled 4,610 and current liabilities totaled 3,048 as compared to current assets totaling 5,052
and current liabilities totaling 2,549 at December 31, 2023. As a result, we had working capital of 1,562 at September 30, 2024, compared
to a working capital of 2,503 at December 31, 2023. The change in the working capital as of September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable
to the loss from operations of 2,713, cash paid for asset acquisition of 400, capital expenditures of 374, offset by net proceeds
of 1,950 from the February Offering and August Offering. 

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that all available funds
and any earnings generated in our business will be used to finance the growth of our business and will not be paid out as dividends to
our shareholders. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and
will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions,
business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Management
is exploring new product channel sales in consumer products, such as cosmetics, athletic products, and proprietary medical devices. The
Company has increased its focus on sales and developing a sales pipeline for potential customers. This customer base expansion will enable
us to provide financial stability for the foreseeable future, expand our current processes, and position us for long-term shareholder
value creation. 

Our recent capital raise expected to close on or about
November 13, 2024 provides working capital necessary to continue our strategic objectives (discussed further within Note 19). We intend
to maintain and attempt to grow our existing contract manufacturing business. We also plan to continue building and developing our catalogue
of consumer products for sale to branding partners and to use our in-house capabilities to create and test market additional branded products.
These products will be target marketed and sold online through social media, television and online marketplaces. Furthermore, the Company
plans to develop its own proprietary medical devices and explore drug delivery programs for its technology. Additionally, the Company
continues to evaluate strategic initiatives (e.g., acquisitions) and additional capital raises through debt or equity may be necessary
to achieve these objectives. 

We
expect to continue incurring losses for the near-term future. Our ability to continue to operate as a going concern in the long term
is dependent upon our ability to manage and grow our current products and to ultimately achieve profitable operations. Management may
consider various options to raise capital to fund potential acquisitions through equity or debt offerings. There can be no assurances,
however, that management will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds, if needed, or that such funds, if available, will be obtained
on terms satisfactory to us. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Additionally,
it is reasonably possible that estimates made in the financial statements have been, or will be, materially and adversely impacted in
the near term as a result of these conditions, including the recoverability of long-lived assets. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests
in assets transferred to entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to entities for any such
assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in entities providing financing, liquidity,
market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about
the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding
of our Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material
to our Financial Statements. 

Share-based
compensation We utilize share-based compensation in the form of incentive stock options. The fair values of incentive stock
option award grants are estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. Compensation expense is recognized
in the statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period required
to obtain full vesting. The expected term of the awards granted is estimated using the simplified method which computes the expected
term as the sum of the award s vesting term plus the original contractual term divided by two. 

35 

 Table of Contents 

Warrant
Liability Warrants to purchase common stock were issued in connection with equity financing raises which occurred during
2019 through 2024. The fair values of the warrants are estimated as of the date of issuance and again at each year end using a Black-Scholes
option valuation model. At issuance, the fair value of the warrant is recognized as an equity issuance cost within additional paid-in-capital.
Fair value adjustments to the warrant liability are recognized in other income (expense) in the statements of operations. The expected
term of the awards granted are based on either the three-year or five-year contractual expiration date. 

Black
Scholes Inputs - The fair value of each stock option award and warrant issued was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option-valuation model, which requires management to make certain assumptions regarding: (i) fair value of the common stock that underlies
the stock option; (ii) the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock; (iii) dividend yield; (iv) risk-free interest
rates; and (iv) the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise (referred to as the expected term). Under
the Black-Scholes option-valuation model, entities typically estimate the expected volatility based on historical volatilities of the
entity s own common stock. Based on the lack of historical data of volatility for the Company s common stock, the Company
based its estimate of expected volatility on a weighted average of the historical volatility of comparable public companies that manufacture
similar products and are similar in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. The fair value of the common stock that underlies
the stock option is estimated by the Company considering the price of the most recent issuance of the Company s common stock. The
dividend yield is based upon the assumption that the Company will not declare a dividend over the life of the options. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the
expected term of the related award.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure
Controls ), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Disclosure Controls
evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective
disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon this evaluation,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our Disclosure Controls were effective as of September, 2024
