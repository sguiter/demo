CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This

Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We have based these forward-looking statements largely
on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends impacting the financial condition of our business.
Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications
of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available
at the time those statements are made and/or management s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events and are
subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested
by the forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking
statements include all statements that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms
such as may, will, should, could, would, expect, 
 intend, seek, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, 
 project, predict, potential, might, forecast, continue, 
or the negative of those terms, and similar expressions and comparable terminology intended to reference future periods. Forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: 

Our ability to effectively
 operate our business; 

Our ability to manage our
 research, development, expansion, growth and operating expenses; 

Our ability to evaluate
 and measure our business, prospects and performance metrics; 

Our ability and our distributors 
 ability to compete, directly and indirectly, and succeed in the highly competitive medical devices industry; 

Our ability to respond
 and adapt to changes in technology and customer behavior; and 

Our ability to protect
 our intellectual property and to develop, maintain and enhance a strong brand. 

Should
one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ
significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned. 

Factors
or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of
them. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Accordingly, the forward-looking statements
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as representations that the results or conditions described in such statements
will occur or that our objectives and plans will be achieved, and we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness
of any of these forward-looking statements.

Overview 

Tenon
Medical, Inc., a medical device company formed in 2012, has developed a proprietary, U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved surgical implant-system, which we call The Catamaran SI Joint Fusion System The Catamaran System ). The
Catamaran System offers a novel, less invasive inferior-posterior approach to the sacroiliac joint SI Joint using a single,
robust titanium implant to treat SI Joint dysfunction that often causes severe lower back pain. The system features the Catamaran 
Fixation Device which passes through both the axial and sagittal planes of the ilium and sacrum, transfixing the SI Joint along its longitudinal
axis. Published clinical studies have shown that 15 to 30 of all chronic lower back pain is associated with the SI Joint. 

With
an entry similar to the SI Joint injection, the surgical approach is direct to the joint. The angle and trajectory of the inferior-posterior
approach is designed to point away from critical neural and vascular structures and into the strongest cortical bone. Joined by a patented
osteotome bridge, the implant design consists of two hollow fenestrated pontoons with an open framework to facilitate bony in-growth
through the SI Joint. One pontoon fixates into the ilium and the other into the sacrum. The osteotome is designed to disrupt the articular
portion of the joint to help facilitate a fusion response. 

Our
initial clinical results indicate that the Catamaran System implant is promoting fusion across the joint as evidenced by computerized
tomography (CT) scans which is the gold standard widely accepted by the clinical community. We had our national launch of The Catamaran
System in October 2022 and are building a sales and marketing infrastructure to market our product and address the greatly underserved
market opportunity that exists. 

We
believe that the implant design and procedure we have developed, along with the 2D and 3D protocols for proper implantation will be received
well by the clinician community who have been looking for a next generation device. 

We have incurred net losses since our inception in 2012. As of September
30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 65.7 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through public
equity offerings, private placements of equity securities, certain debt-related financing arrangements, and sales of our product. We have
devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development, regulatory matters and sales and marketing of our product. 

Reverse
Stock Splits 

On
November 2, 2023, we effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split (the 2023 Reverse Stock Split ), which combined every ten shares
of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to effecting the 2023 Reverse Stock Split into one share of common stock.
No fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split. 

On
September 6, 2024, we effected a 1-for-8 reverse stock split (the 2024 Reverse Stock Split ), which combined every eight
shares of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to effecting the 2024 Reverse Stock Split into one share of common
stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2024 Reverse Stock Split. 

All historical share and per share amounts reflected
throughout this document have been adjusted to reflect the 2023 Reverse Stock Split and the 2024 Reverse Stock Split. The authorized
number of shares and the par value per share of our common stock were not affected by the 2023 Reverse Stock Split or the 2024 Reverse
Stock Split. 

17 

Components
of Results of Operations 

Revenue 

We
derive substantially all our revenue from sales of The Catamaran System to a limited number of clinicians. Revenue from sales of The
Catamaran System fluctuates based on volume of cases (procedures performed), discounts, and the number of implants used for a particular
patient. Similar to other orthopedic companies, our revenue can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, including
reimbursement, changes in independent sales representatives and physician activities. 

Cost
of Goods Sold, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin 

We
utilize contract manufacturers for production of The Catamaran System implants and Catamaran Tray Sets. Cost of goods sold consists primarily
of overhead related to operation personnel and facility costs, costs of the components of The Catamaran System implants and instruments,
quality inspection, packaging, scrap and inventory obsolescence, as well as distribution-related expenses such as logistics and shipping
costs. We anticipate that certain of our cost of goods sold will increase in absolute dollars as case levels increase. 

Our
gross margins have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the cost to have our product manufactured
for us, pricing pressure from increasing competition, and the factors described above impacting our revenue. 

Operating
Expenses 

Our
operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs
are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of consulting expenses, salaries, sales commissions and other cash
and stock-based compensation related expenses. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest
and grow our business. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, commissions, stock-based compensation expense and travel and entertainment expenses
of our sales and market personnel along with commissions paid to our independent distributors. We expect our sales and marketing expenses
to increase in absolute dollars with the increased sales of The Catamaran System resulting in higher commissions and salaries, increased
clinician and sales representative training, and the cost to complete our clinical study to gain wider clinician adoption of The Catamaran
System. Our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to timing of sales and marketing activities related
to the commercial activity of our product. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Our
research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering, product development, regulatory expenses, and consulting services,
outside prototyping services, outside research activities, materials, and other costs associated with the development and refinement
of our product. Research and development expenses also include related personnel and consultants compensation and stock-based
compensation expense. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect research and development expense to increase
in absolute dollars as we improve The Catamaran System, develop new products, add research and development personnel, and undergo clinical
activities that may be required for regulatory clearances of future products. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, consultants compensation, stock-based compensation expense, and other
costs for finance, accounting, legal, compliance, and administrative matters. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase
in absolute dollars as we add personnel and information technology infrastructure to support the growth of our business. We also expect
to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including but not limited to: expenses
related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and those of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC
on which our securities are traded; additional insurance expenses; investor relations activities; and other administrative and professional
services. While we expect the general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars, we anticipate that it will decrease
as a percentage of revenue over time. 

18 

Gain
on Investments, Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), Net 

Gain
on investments consists of interest income and realized gains and losses from the sale of our investments in money market and corporate
debt securities. Interest expense is related to borrowings. Other income and expenses have not been significant to date.

Revenue. The
fluctuations in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily
due to a decrease of 15 and an increase of 5 , respectively, in the number of surgical procedures in which the Catamaran System was
used. The number of procedures in the third quarter was impacted by the longer timeline of implementation, training and development of our restructured
sales operation, as well as unexpected reimbursement pre-authorization impacts, leading to fewer surgeries performed during the quarter. 

Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit, and Gross
Margin. The change in cost of goods sold for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods
in 2023 was due to a decrease of 15 and an increase of 5 , respectively, in the number of surgical procedures performed. Gross profit
and gross margin percentage for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 varied
due to the absorption of production overhead costs into our standard cost, operating leverage created due to lower relative fixed costs
and fluctuations in revenue associated with the fluctuations in the number of surgical procedures.

the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to SpineSource transition fees
in 2023 893), decreased payroll and employee expenses 316), consulting and professional fees 76) and commission expense 54). 

General
and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared
to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increased payroll and employee expenses 85), legal and professional service fees 15),
insurance costs 35), partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation 111). General and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increased insurance costs 226), payroll
and employee expenses 111), legal and professional service fees 65) and bad debt expense 46), partially offset by decreases in
stock-based compensation 89). 

Gain
on Investments, Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), Net 

Gain on investments for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 decreased as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023 due to interest on our investments in money market and corporate
debt securities. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to our convertible debt. Other expense, net was
related to foreign exchange losses on the liquidation of our Swiss subsidiary. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 9.2 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations through
private placements of preferred stock, debt financing arrangements, our initial public offering, additional stock offerings and the sale
of our products. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding debt. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated
deficit of 65.7 million and expect to incur additional losses in the future. We have not achieved positive cash flow from operations
to date. Based upon our current operating plan, our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses
and working capital requirements through at least the next 12 months from the date these consolidated financial statements were available
to be released. We plan to raise the necessary additional capital through one or a combination of public or private equity offerings,
debt financings, and collaborations. We continue to face challenges and uncertainties and, as a result, our available capital resources
may be consumed more rapidly than currently expected due to (a) the uncertainty of future revenues from The Catamaran System; (b) changes
we may make to the business that affect ongoing operating expenses; (c) changes we may make in our business strategy; (d) regulatory developments
affecting our existing products; (e) changes we may make in our research and development spending plans; and (f) other items affecting
our forecasted level of expenditures and use of cash resources. 

As
we attempt to raise additional capital to fund our operations, funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If
we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our sales
and marketing efforts, research and development activities, or other operations. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital
through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and collaborations. If we do raise additional capital through
public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities
may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through
debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional
debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we are unable to raise capital, we will need to delay, reduce, or terminate
planned activities to reduce costs. Doing so will likely harm our ability to execute our business plans. Due to the uncertainty in our
ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern for the next
twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

The
decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023 was primarily attributable to our decreased net loss of 1.9 million, adjusted for decreases in non-cash stock-based compensation
expenses 202), in addition to increased accounts payable 660), partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 404). 

Cash provided by investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 223). Cash provided by investing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of the net sales of short-term investments 6,503) to fund our operations,
partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 269). 

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of
common stock and warrants 3,862), the exercise of warrants under the inducement agreement 4,306), the issuance of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock 2,437) and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock 489) and from issuances of common stock 2,106). Cash provided by
financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of the 4.8 million, net of relevant expenses,
received from our registered offering in June 2023. 

Critical
Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments, and Use of Estimates 

Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported results of operations
during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from three other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our existing critical accounting policies
from those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships,
such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

Not

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed
by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President
and Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations
to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, with a company have been prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Even disclosure controls and procedures determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives
are achieved. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and President and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and President and Principal Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
not effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Our
size has prevented us from being able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level of supervision and segregation
of duties. Therefore, it is difficult to effectively segregate accounting duties which comprises a material weakness in internal controls.
This lack of segregation of duties leads management to conclude that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective
to give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports that the Company files under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. 

To
the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses, including,
but not limited to, increasing the capacity of our qualified financial personnel to ensure that accounting policies and procedures are
consistent across the organization and that we have adequate control over our Exchange Act reporting disclosures. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control procedures over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
