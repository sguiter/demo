 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

.
The Company was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Although there is no restriction or limitation
on what industry its target operates in, it is the Company s intention to pursue prospective targets that are focused on healthcare
innovation. The Company anticipates targeting what are traditionally known as small cap companies domiciled in North America,
Europe and/or the Asia Pacific regions that are developing assets in the biopharmaceutical, medical technology/medical device and diagnostics
space which aligns with its management team s experience in operating health care companies and in drug and device technology development
as well as diagnostic and other services. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activities through September 30, 2024 related to the Company s
formation and the Initial Public Offering (as defined below). Since the Initial Public Offering, the Company s activity has been
limited to the evaluation of business combination candidates. The Company will not generate any operating revenue until after the completion
of its initial business combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on
cash in bank and investments held in the Trust Account (as defined below) from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.
The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such,
the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 

The
Company s sponsor is Aimei Investment Ltd, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the Sponsor ). The registration statement
for the Company s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 30, 2023. On December 6, 2023, the Company consummated
its Initial Public Offering of units (the Units and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units
being offered, the Public Shares ), at per Unit, which includes full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment
option of Units, generating gross proceeds of (the Initial Public Offering ), and incurring offering
costs of and for deferred underwriting commissions (see Note 7). The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option
to purchase up to an additional Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. On December 6, 2023,
the over-allotment option was exercised in full. 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the closing of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of units
(the Private Units to the Sponsor at a price of per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of (the Private
Placement ). (see Note 4). 

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on December 6, 2023, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the
sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Units was placed in a trust
account (the Trust Account ), located in the United States and held as cash items or may be invested only in U.S. government
treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
under the Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i)
the consummation of a business combination, or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s shareholders,
as described below. 

The
Company will provide its public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion
of its initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination
or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed business combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of
a business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of how
they vote for the business combination. If a vote is held to approve such an initial business combination, the Company will consummate
such initial business combination only if the Company has the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote
at a general meeting of the Company. 

AIMEI
HEALTH TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD 

 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The
shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially
 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company
to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced
by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion
of a business combination with respect to the Company s rights. 

If
a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company
will, pursuant to its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and
Regulation 14E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which regulate issuer tender offers,
and file tender offer documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC prior to completing its initial
business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is
required under the SEC s proxy rules. 

The
Sponsor has agreed (i) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (ii) not to redeem any shares
in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or any amendment to the Company s charter
prior to the consummation of its initial business combination and (iii) not to sell any shares to us in a tender offer in connection
with any proposed business combination. However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with
respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its business combination. 

The
Company will have until 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 24 months from the closing of the Initial
Public Offering if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a business combination by up to 12 additional months through
12 one-month extensions of time, as further provided in the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association)
to consummate a business combination (the Combination Period ). 

The
underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company
does not complete a business combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds
held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is
possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the offering price per Unit ). 

The
Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce
the amounts in the Trust Account to below per share (whether or not the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised
in full), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and
except as to any claims under its indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor
will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company has not independently verified whether
the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believes that the Sponsor s only assets are securities
of the Company. The Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such obligations and therefore believes the Sponsor will be unlikely
to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. However, the Company believes the likelihood of the Sponsor having
to indemnify the Trust Account is limited because the Company will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as
well as other entities execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held
in the Trust Account. 

AIMEI
HEALTH TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD 

 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

On
June 19, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the Merger Agreement for a business
combination with (i) United Hydrogen Group Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands United
Hydrogen ), (ii) United Hydrogen Global Inc., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands Pubco ),
(iii) United Hydrogen Victor Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Pubco First Merger Sub (iv) United Hydrogen Worldwide Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited
liability in the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco Second Merger Sub and, together with Pubco and
First Merger Sub, each, individually, an Acquisition Entity and, collectively, the Acquisition Entities 
and (v) Aimei Investment Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company, in the capacity as, from and after the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Closing ), the representative for the Company and its shareholders (the Sponsor ). 

Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, (i) First Merger Sub will merge with and into the United
Hydrogen (the First Merger ), whereby the separate existence of First Merger Sub will cease, and United Hydrogen will be
the surviving corporation of the First Merger and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco; and (ii) following confirmation of the effective
filing of the First Merger, and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, Second Merger Sub will merge with and into
the Company (the Second Merger , and together with the First Merger, the Mergers ), whereby the separate existence
of Second Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will be the surviving corporation of the Second Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Pubco. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its bank account, in its Trust Account and working capital deficit of
 . 

The
Company s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through (i) the payment of 
from the Sponsor to cover certain offering costs on the Company s behalf in exchange for issuance of Founder Shares (see Note 5),
and (ii) a loan from the Sponsor of approximately under the Note (as defined in Note 5). The Company has repaid the note in
full on December 7, 2023. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity has been satisfied
through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account.
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor,
or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as
defined in Note 5). As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loan. 

Over
the period of time to complete a business combination, the Company will be using the funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying
existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial business combination candidates, performing due diligence on
prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring,
negotiating and consummating the business combination. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , management
has determined that if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time
from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the Public Shares and
thereafter liquidate and dissolve raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying unaudited financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. U.S. GAAP ), which
contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.

and , respectively. 

ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for
the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer
in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate
of incorporation. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity , conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either
within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s
control) are classified as temporary equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the
entity s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the Company did not specify a maximum redemption
threshold, its charter provides that currently, the Company will not redeem its Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible
assets (shareholders equity) to be less than . However, the threshold in its charter would not change the nature of
the underlying shares as redeemable and thus Public Shares would be required to be disclosed outside of permanent equity. Accordingly,
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and ordinary shares subject to possible redemption at the redemption
amount, respectively, were presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of the
Company s unaudited balance sheets.

review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. 

The
Company is considered to be an exempted Cayman Islands company with no connection to any other taxable jurisdiction and is presently
not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States. As such, there was provision

of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a business combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon exchange
of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares

by investors in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a business combination in which the
Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share
consideration the holders of the ordinary share will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into ordinary share basis and each
holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive 1/5th of one share underlying each right (without

of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the
Trust Account with respect to such rights. Accordingly, the rights may expire worthless.

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Our only activities from inception to September 30, 2024 were
organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for and conduct the IPO, and those required to identify and evaluate a target company
for a business combination. We will not generate any operating revenue until after the completion of our initial business combination,
at the earliest. We have generated and will continue to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash in bank
and investments held in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders (the Trust Account ), from
the proceeds derived from the IPO. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting
and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 2,108,102, which consisted of dividend income earned on investments
held in the Trust Account of 2,770,867 offset by formation and operational costs of 662,765. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 743,510, which consisted of dividend income earned on investments
held in the Trust Account of 943,529 offset by formation and operational costs of 200,019. 

For
the period from April 27, 2023 (inception) to September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 3,618, which consisted of formation and operational
costs of 3,618. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 103,559 in our operating bank account, 72,660,715 in our Trust Account, and working capital deficit of
 106,889. 

Our
liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the IPO were satisfied through the payment of 25,000 from the Sponsor to cover certain
offering costs on our behalf in exchange for issuance of founder shares, and the borrowing of approximately 210,151 from the Sponsor
under an unsecured promissory note (see Note 5 Related Party Transactions in the notes to our unaudited financial
statements). We have repaid the unsecured promissory note in full on December 7, 2023. Subsequent to the consummation of the IPO, our
liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) held
outside of the Trust Account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor
or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors, may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working
Capital Loans (as defined in Note 5 Related Party Transactions in the notes to our unaudited financial statements).
As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the Working Capital Loans. 

Based
on the foregoing, management believes that we will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet our anticipated cash
needs prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business
combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our business combination,
in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. However, we cannot provide
any assurance that new financing will be available. Over the time period prior to our initial business combination, we will be using
the funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial business
combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target
business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business combination.

Going
Concern Consideration 

In
connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15,
 Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined
that if we are unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time from the closing of
our IPO, the requirement that we cease all operations, redeem the public shares, and thereafter liquidate and dissolve, raises substantial
doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplate the continuation of our Company as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets, or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do
not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as
variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have
not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments
of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, or long-term liabilities. The underwriter is
entitled to a deferred fee of one percent (1.0 of the gross proceeds of the IPO upon closing of a business combination, or 690,000.
The deferred fee will be paid in cash upon the closing of the business combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account (as defined
below), subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2024, there were no critical accounting policies or estimates. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on our audited financial statements.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and
chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September
30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of
September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

No
changes occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

The
following Use of Proceeds information relates to the registration statement on Form S-1 (File Number 333-272230), as amended
(the Registration Statement for our IPO, which was declared effective by the SEC on November 30, 2023. On December 6,
2023, we consummated our IPO of 6,000,000 units (the Units ). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share, 0.0001 par value Ordinary Share ), and one right Right to receive one-fifth (1/5) of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation
of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 60,000,000.
Pursuant to that certain underwriting agreement, dated December 1, 2023, we granted Spartan Capital Securities, LLC, the representative
of the underwriters, a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 Units solely to cover over-allotments, if any (the Over-Allotment
Option ). Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the underwriters exercised the Over-Allotment Option in full, generating
total proceeds of 9,000,000. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO on December 6, 2023, we consummated the private placement Private Placement with Aimei Investment
Ltd. of 332,000 units (the Private Units ), generating total proceeds of 3,320,000. The Private Units are identical to
the Units sold as part of the public Units in this offering. Additionally, Aimei Investment Ltd. agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell
any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until
the completion of our initial business combination. Aimei Investment Ltd. was granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights
in connection with the purchase of the Private Units. 

On
December 6, 2023, a total of 69,690,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO and the Private Placement, were placed
in the Trust Account, located in the U.S. and held as cash items or may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning
set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company
that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us,
until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a business combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to our
shareholders. 

We
paid a total of 1,380,000 in underwriting discounts (excluding deferred underwriting discount of 690,000) and 550,000 for other costs
and expenses related to the IPO. 

Additionally,
the underwriters are entitled to 690,000, equal to 1.0 of the gross proceeds of this offering, payable to the underwriters as deferred
underwriting discounts at the closing of our initial business combination from the funds to be placed in the Trust Account. Such funds
will be released to the underwriters only upon consummation of an initial business combination, as described in the Registration Statement.
If the business combination is not consummated, such deferred discounts will be forfeited by the underwriters. The underwriters will
not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discount.
