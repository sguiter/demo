 PLAN OF OPERATION 
 
 Auto Parts Division: 
 
 The company has decided to only trade in auto parts business. 
 
 City Autos, Corp. 
 
 The prospects are under review, the subsidiary may be closed for business as nothing much has been transacted since the beginning of 2024. 
 
 Motors Metal, Inc.: 
 
 Having shelved the plan to set up a scrap metal processing plant at its facility in King George, as the purchase orders of customers from abroad are still active, the management in addition to trading in scrap metal may continue pursuing setting up its own facility. 
 
 The Company has moved its corporate office to 9243 John F. Kennedy Blvd., North Bergen, NJ 07047- 5322. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The Company did recognize revenue for a sum of 6,123 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 4,032 of revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net revenues for the period ended September 30, 2024 were greater by 2,091 than for the same period during 2023 and the Cost of Goods Sold was low by 11,786 during the period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period during 2023. There is a Gross Profit of 2,339 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to the Gross Loss of 11,539 for the same period during 2023 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred operational expenses of 428,941. This compares to 93,821 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in operational expenses is due to an increase in professional and financial expenses that were responded upon receiving final statements from the lending banks. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a net gain of 812,683 as compared to the net loss of 71,065 for the corresponding period in the year 2023 thus recognizing a significant increase as compared to the nine months ended September 30,2023 due to gain upon sale of fixed assets, i.e. upon sale of 19+ acre property. 
 
 The tax returns for the previous year has be filed within the allowed filing date with no tax liability. 
 
 The credit committee comprising of sole member, namely Mr. Sabir Saleem reviewed all trade receivables and trade payables that were long outstanding and had become stagnant and un-collectible. All such amounts have been written off and/or set off so as not to show as an asset or liability on the books of accounts of the Company. The net impact of such adjustments amounted to 81,527.49 which has been booked as a loss. However, such receivables and payables have been recorded as memorandum and would be recognized as other income if and when such amounts are received. 
 10 

LIQUIDITY 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared to assume that we will continue as a going concern. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company had total current assets of 381,121 consisting of 34,289 in cash 
 
 and 6,680 in trade receivables, there was zero value of Inventory, receivable from IRS 32,730 and Notes Receivable 300,000. 
 
 REVENUE RECOGNITION 
 
 The Company recognizes revenues on arrangements in accordance with Securitas and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13, REVENUE RECOGNITION and FASB ASC 605-15-25, REVENUE RECONGNITION. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability is reasonable assured. The Company reported gross revenues of 2,924,181 up to September 30, 2024 since it began operations. 
 
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
 
 On August 26, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the addition of Mr. Ravinder Tikoo M.D as a member of the Company Board of Directors and appointed as Chairman of the Company. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
 
 As a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by item 10 of Regulation S-K , we are not required to provide information required by this item. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEURES 
 
 Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control so as to 
 
 (1) maintain the records in reasonable detail, which will accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; 
 
 (2) to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are made within the delegated authority ; and 
 
 (3) to provide reasonable assurance for the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on company s financial statements. 
 
 However, the management asserts that the company does not have any accounting staff due to limited financial resources though has plans to recruit gradually. Also, this company does not have a well written document on accounting policies and procedures, though has plans to have them shortly. Consequently, this can result in possible errors in the presentation and disclosure of financial information in our annual, quarterly, and other filings. 
 
 The SIC Code of 1700 as showing in Edgar for this company is no longer valid, since this company is now dealing with the auto parts, as OEM Recycled Auto Parts. Segregation of duties is an important factor in Internal Control. Though it is achieved to a certain extent, the management is committed to strengthen the internal controls effectively in the coming months. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
