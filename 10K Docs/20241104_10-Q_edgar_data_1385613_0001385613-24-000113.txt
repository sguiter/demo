Overview 

Business Overview 
 
 We are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with an underwriting and investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term shareholder value by providing risk management solutions to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces. 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024 Q3 2024 we earned a net income of 35.2 million, an increase of 21.8 million over the same period in the prior year, principally due to strong performance from our investment in Solasglas. Our underwriting results were lower by 8.3 million in Q3 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023 Q3 2023 ). 
 
 The following is a summary of our financial performance for Q3 2024, compared to Q3 2023: 
 Gross premiums written was 168.3 million, a decrease of 8.0 ; 
 Net premiums earned was 151.9 million, a decrease of 6.9 ; 
 Net underwriting income (1) was 6.1 million, compared to 14.4 million; 
 Current year CAT losses, net of reinsurance, were 14.1 million, including 7.5 million from Hurricane Helene, compared to 13.2 million; 
 Favorable prior year loss development was 5.7 million, compared to 3.3 million; 
 Total investment income was 28.1 million, an increase of 23.0 million (including 5.2 net return from our investment in Solasglas), compared to net return of (0.6) ; and 
 Diluted EPS was 1.01, compared to 0.39. 
 
 Fully diluted book value per share (1) was 18.72 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 11.8 since December 31, 2023. 
 
 On October 18, 2024, A.M. Best affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings of a- (Excellent) for our principal operating subsidiaries and revised the outlooks to positive from stable. The positive outlook reflects A.M. Best s view of our operating performance, which has steadily improved in recent years. 
 
 (1) See Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures section of this MD A. 

Outlook and Trends 
 
 We have witnessed an active North Atlantic Hurricane season to date, with the industry s attention now on the widely varying insured loss estimate ranges for Hurricanes Helene and Milton. It has also been an active year in many regions for secondary peril events with the reinsurance market s share of these events varying depending on the region and reinsurance structures in those regions. These dynamics will contribute to the restructuring and repricing of property reinsurance deals during the upcoming key renewal season. We believe that property reinsurance capacity remains well matched to meet demand in the current state of the market. 
 
 Another key focus in the industry is the degree of additional reserve strengthening that may emerge in casualty classes throughout the remainder of the year. We anticipate continued primary rate increases and tightening reinsurance terms in US Casualty. 
 
 We have been watching significant rising global geopolitical tensions, including in the Middle East. There is worldwide attention on the upcoming U.S. election, which could have far reaching implications from a global macroeconomic and trade perspective, while we have also begun to see rate cuts from various Central Banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve. Our cedants are attentive to these dynamics, which will be a core focus of the renewal season. The 2024 mid-year renewals have been characterized by a healthy balance of supply and demand of reinsurance capacity. Reinsurance terms and conditions are retaining discipline across a majority of classes, most notably with respect to property excess of loss attachment points. We continue to view the terms and conditions available in the property and specialty market as attractive for growth. 
 
 The anticipated interest rates cuts could have a meaningful favorable impact on our interest expense relating to our floating rate term loan, which would be offset by lower interest income earned on our restricted cash and cash equivalents.

1 The net financial impact associated with changes in the estimate of losses incurred in prior years, which incorporates earned reinstatement premiums assumed and ceded, adjustments to assumed and ceded acquisition costs, and deposit interest income and expense, was an income of 4.6 million and 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a loss of 1.1 million and 12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 2 Net underwriting income is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures above for discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. 

The following provides further details on the significant variances for Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 YTD 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 YTD 2023 ). 
 
 Overview 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Fully diluted book value per share increased by 1.07 per share, or 6.1 , to 18.72 per share from 17.65 per share at June 30, 2024. Basic book value per share increased by 1.10 per share, or 6.1 , to 19.05 per share from 17.95 per share at June 30, 2024. 
 
 Net income was 35.2 million for Q3 2024, compared to net income of 13.5 million reported for Q3 2023. 
 
 The developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during Q3 2024, compared to Q3 2023, are summarized below: 
 
 Underwriting income : Decreased by 8.3 million due to an increase of 4.7 percentage points to our combined ratio on lower net premiums earned. The increase in our combined ratio was driven by the increase in loss ratio, acquisition cost ratio, and underwriting expense ratio. While the attritional loss ratio for our underwriting portfolio and current year CAT losses were higher in the current quarter than in Q3 2023, this was offset partially by improved prior year loss development. Current year CAT losses contributed 9.3 to our combined ratio, compared to 8.1 in Q3 2023. For further information on CAT losses and prior year loss development, refer to Note 7 - Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves of the Q3 2024 Financials. 
 Investment income : Increased by 23.0 million primarily driven by our investment in Solasglas, which reported a gain of 19.8 million during Q3 2024, compared to a loss of 1.9 million during Q3 2023. Solasglas generated a net return of 5.2 for Q3 2024 compared to a net return of (0.6) for Q3 2023. 
 Corporate expense : Increased by 1.0 million mainly due to an increase in personnel costs, overhead costs, and technology investment to support the business growth we experienced in the last two years. 
 Foreign exchange gains (losses) : 5.8 million foreign exchange gains for Q3 2024, compared to 2.0 million foreign exchange losses in Q3 2023, driven mainly by the strengthening of the pound sterling against the U.S. dollar in Q3 2024. 
 Other income, net : Increased by 1.5 million due to higher investment income generated on funds withheld by third party Lloyd s syndicates, reported on a quarterly lag basis. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Fully diluted book value per share increased by 1.98 per share, or 11.8 , to 18.72 per share from 16.74 per share at December 31, 2023. Basic book value per share increased by 2.18 per share, or 12.9 , to 19.05 per share from 16.87 per share at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Net income was 70.2 million for YTD 2024, compared to net income of 69.2 million reported for YTD 2023. 
 
 The developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during YTD 2024, compared to YTD 2023, are summarized below: 
 
 Underwriting income : Decreased by 10.4 million due to 2.4 percentage points increase in our combined ratio, offset partially by an increase in net premiums earned. The increase in our combined ratio was driven by the 
 28 

Return to table of contents 

increase in loss ratio, acquisition cost ratio, and underwriting expense ratio. While the current year CAT losses contributed 8.5 percentage points to our combined ratio, compared to 5.1 percentage points for YTD 2023, this was offset partially by improved prior year loss development. For further information on CAT losses and prior year loss development, refer to Note 7 - Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves of the Q3 2024 Financials. 
 Investment income : Increased by 14.5 million primarily driven by our investment in Solasglas, which reported a gain of 42.4 million during YTD 2024, compared to a gain of 27.8 million during the equivalent period in 2023. Solasglas generated a net return of 11.9 for YTD 2024, compared to a net return of 9.1 for YTD 2023. 
 Corporate expense : Decreased by 0.5 million mainly due to non-recurring severance costs included in YTD 2023 and lower outside legal costs following the hiring of our new General Counsel in April 2023. This was partially offset by the increase in other personnel and overhead costs as noted for Q3 2024. 
 Foreign exchange gains (losses) : 3.2 million foreign exchange gains for YTD 2024, compared to 7.7 million foreign exchange gains for YTD 2023, driven mainly by a stronger pound sterling movement against the U.S. dollar in YTD 2023. 
 Other income, net : Increased by 4.2 million due to stronger investment income generated on funds withheld by third party Lloyd s syndicates, reported on a quarterly lag basis. 

Underwriting Results by Segment 
 
 The following provides a further discussion of our underwriting results for our Property Casualty (Re)insurance operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Gross Premiums Written 
 
 Details of gross premiums written are provided in the following table: 
 Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 Property 13,625 8.1 32,940 18.0 61,578 11.1 94,660 18.0 Casualty 92,124 54.7 108,964 59.5 279,118 50.3 284,560 54.3 Other 62,597 37.2 41,170 22.5 213,883 38.6 145,252 27.7 Total 168,346 100.0 183,074 100.0 554,579 100.0 524,472 100.0 
 
 As a result of our underwriting philosophy, the total premiums we write and the mix of premiums between property, casualty, and other business, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the market opportunities we identify. 
 
 Our Q3 2024 gross premiums written decreased by 14.7 million, or 8.0 , compared to the equivalent 2023 period.

Return to table of contents 

The following table provides a further analysis of this overall decrease: 
 Gross Premiums Written Three months ended September 30, 2024 Increase (decrease) in millions) change Explanation Property (19.3) (58.6) Driven predominantly by the non-renewal of a U.S. homeowners property treaty on January 1st and a net reduction to estimated ultimate gross premiums for certain treaties. 
 Casualty (16.8) (15.5) Mainly due to the following: 
 
 General Liability by 3.2 million, or 10.3 , primarily due to net reduction to estimated ultimate gross premiums for certain deals, coupled with a decrease in our line share for certain non-proportional treaty and quota-share treaties. This was partially offset by favorable rate changes on renewed business and new business. 
 Multiline by 8.4 million, or 12.3 , driven mainly by non-renewed FAL business on January 1st which contributed 8.9 million to the change in the quarter, partially offset by net growth in premiums written from existing FAL business. 
 Workers Compensation by 3.5 million, or 79.1 , due to timing of renewal for an excess of loss treaty, coupled with the non-renewal of quota share treaties in 2022 a portion of which was written in 2023. 
 Professional Liability by 1.6 million, or 98.0 , primarily due to non-renewal of certain quota-share treaties. 
 
 Other 21.4 52.0 Driven predominantly by new business in our Marine and Energy class. This was partially offset by 5.2 million, or 30.4 , decrease in our Financial class due to lower premium volume from our surety and transactional liability business. 

Our YTD 2024 gross premiums written increased by 30.1 million, or 5.7 , compared to the equivalent 2023 period. 
 
 The following table provides a further analysis of this overall increase: 
 Gross Premiums Written Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Increase (decrease) in millions) change Explanation Property (33.1) (34.9) Same trends as noted for Q3 2024. Casualty (5.4) (1.9) Same trends as noted for Q3 2024, except for General Liability, which increased by 4.1 million, or 5.1 , driven by favorable rate changes in 2024, coupled with growth from 2023 quota share treaties and new business. 
 
 General Liability and Multi-line classes accounted for 30 and 62 , respectively, of total Casualty, compared to 28 and 62 , respectively, in the same period in 2023. 
 Other 68.6 47.2 Driven predominantly by new business in our Marine and Energy class, including Lloyd s whole account excess of loss treaties. The Financial class also grew as a result of new non-proportional mortgage and financial multiline treaties, partially offset by lower premium volume from our surety and transactional liability business. 
 
 Premiums Ceded 
 
 For Q3 2024, premiums ceded were 26.6 million, or 15.8 of gross premiums written, compared to 14.8 million, or 8.1 of gross premiums written, for the same quarter in 2023. For YTD 2024, premiums ceded were 64.6 million, or 11.7 of gross premiums written, compared to 35.7 million, or 6.8 of gross premiums written, for YTD 2023.

Return to table of contents 

The increase in both periods was primarily due to the purchase of additional retrocessional coverage to manage our overall exposure to Aviation and Marine and Energy in light of growth in these classes of business during 2024 and to reinstate certain retro excess-of-loss treaties in which the full coverage was presumed exhausted primarily from the Baltimore Bridge loss event in Q1 2024. Additionally, we had an increase in quota share retrocessions for Other Specialty business due to growth from inward premiums. 
 
 Net Premiums Written 
 
 Details of net premiums written are provided in the following table: 
 Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 Property 9,819 6.9 24,771 14.7 47,878 9.8 77,397 15.8 Casualty 84,134 59.4 103,542 61.5 261,015 53.3 275,578 56.4 Other 47,795 33.7 39,972 23.8 181,075 37.0 135,757 27.8 Total 141,748 100.0 168,285 100.0 489,968 100.0 488,732 100.0 
 
 For Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, net premiums written decreased by 26.5 million, or 15.8 , and increased by 1.2 million or 0.3 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The movement in net premiums written resulted from the changes in gross premiums written and ceded during the periods as previously noted. 
 
 Net Premiums Earned 
 
 Details of net premiums earned are provided in the following table: 
 Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 Property 19,134 12.6 24,362 14.9 60,610 12.8 63,854 14.3 Casualty 83,079 54.7 93,514 57.3 263,872 55.9 259,075 58.1 Other 49,671 32.7 45,234 27.8 147,336 31.2 122,773 27.6 Total 151,884 100.0 163,110 100.0 471,818 100.0 445,702 100.0 
 
 Net premiums earned for Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, decreased by 11.2 million or 6.9 , and increased by 26.1 million or 5.9 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The change in net premiums earned is primarily a function of the amount and timing of net premiums written during the current and prior periods.

 Current accident year loss ratio increased by 3.6 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points for Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, driven mainly by 1.2 points and 1.9 points increase in CAT losses, respectively, coupled with a change in business mix with higher attritional loss ratio. 
 For Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, prior year favorable loss development improved by 1.7 percentage points and 2.6 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Refer to Note 7 for further details on prior year loss development. 
 Details of net losses incurred by line of business are provided in the following table:

 The below table summarizes the loss ratios by line of business: Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 Increase / (decrease) in loss ratio points 2024 2023 Increase / (decrease) in loss ratio points Property 112.4 54.1 58.3 90.1 81.6 8.5 Casualty 52.7 67.4 (14.7) 61.5 67.0 (5.5) Other 56.1 45.6 10.5 59.4 47.5 11.9 Total 61.3 59.4 1.9 64.5 63.8 0.7 
 The following provides further details on the change in Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023. 
 Net Losses Incurred Three months ended September 30, 2024 Increase / (decrease) in loss ratio points Property 58.3 Driven by 63.3 points of higher current year CAT loss events mainly from Hurricane Helene and additional severe U.S. convective storms. This was partially offset by favorable prior year loss development. 
 Casualty (14.7) Driven mainly by 7.6 million of prior year favorable loss development, compared to 8.6 million of prior year adverse loss development in Q3 2023, which contributed 18.3 points improvement to the overall decrease in loss ratio. The Q3 2024 prior year favorable loss development was mainly from our general liability class (2020-2022 underwriting years); whereas for the same period in 2023, the adverse loss development was related to legacy motor, workers compensation and professional liability program. 
 Other 10.5 Driven by 2.4 million of prior year adverse loss development, compared to 9.7 million of prior year favorable loss development in Q3 2023, which contributed 26.2 points to the overall increase in loss ratio. The Q3 2024 prior year adverse loss development was mainly from marine and energy business across multiple years (2020-2023); whereas for the same period in 2023, the favorable loss development was related mainly to marine and energy, cyber, and group medical classes. 
 
 Offsetting the above increase, non-natural CAT losses were 12.7 points lower in the current period compared to the prior year period.

The following provides further details on the change in YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023. 
 Net Losses Incurred Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Increase / (decrease) in loss ratio points Property 8.5 Driven by 11.5 points of higher current year CAT loss events. For the YTD 2024, these were driven mainly by the Baltimore Bridge collapse, Hurricane Helene, and U.S. tornados (including severe convective storms), whereas for YTD 2023 the CAT losses were driven mainly by the Turkey earthquake, New Zealand Cyclone Gabrielle, and U.S. tornados (including severe convective storms). 
 
 Additionally, we recognized 4.5 million of prior year adverse loss development relating primarily to the U.S. severe convective storms in 2023, compared to 1.1 million of prior year favorable loss development in YTD 2023. This contributed 10.9 points to the increase in loss ratio. 
 
 The above was partially offset by the change in business mix, with Commercial Property accounting for 73 of total premium earned, compared to 48 in the prior period. This class has a lower attritional loss rate than for Personal Property and Motor classes of business. 
 Casualty (5.5) Due to 0.4 million of prior year favorable loss development compared to 22.3 million of prior year adverse loss development in YTD 2023, which contributed 8.2 points improvement to the overall decrease in loss ratio. The YTD 2023 prior year adverse loss development was related to same classes as previously noted for Q3 2023. Additionally, the lack of CAT losses associated with this line of business in YTD 2024 also contributed to the overall reduction in loss ratio. 
 Other 11.9 Due to the lower prior year favorable loss development compared to Q3 2023, which contributed 5.0 points to the overall increase in loss ratio. For YTD 2024, the prior year favorable loss development of 5.1 million was driven primarily by our mortgage, cyber, and energy classes; whereas in YTD 2023 the prior year favorable loss development was related to the same classes as previously noted for Q3 2023. 
 
 Additionally, the overall loss ratio increased by 5.1 points due to higher CAT losses compared to prior year period. The increase in CAT losses was driven mainly by the Baltimore bridge collapse in Q1 2024. 

Acquisition Costs, Net 
 
 For Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, our total acquisition costs decreased by 1.6 to 46.2 million, and increased by 9.1 to 138.2 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The YTD 2024 increase was mainly due to growth in net premiums earned. The acquisition cost ratios by line of business were as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 Increase / (decrease) in acquisition cost ratio points 2024 2023 Increase / (decrease) in acquisition cost ratio points Property 19.9 17.7 2.2 17.1 18.5 (1.4) Casualty 34.0 31.9 2.1 32.6 31.0 1.6 Other 28.4 28.2 0.2 28.3 28.2 0.1 Total 30.4 28.8 1.6 29.3 28.4 0.9

The following provides further details on the change in Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023. 
 Change in Acquisition Cost Ratios Three months ended September 30, 2024 Increase / (decrease) in acquisition cost ratio points Explanation Property 2.2 Driven mainly by the profit commission associated with a significant quota share treaty in our Commercial Property class. 
 Casualty 2.1 Primarily due to higher than previously estimated acquisition costs for certain 2023 and 2024 FAL business within our Multi-line class. This was partially offset primarily by a lower acquisition cost ratio for General Liability, driven mainly by a reduction in profit commission for a significant Innovation quota share treaty. Other 0.2 No significant change. 
 The following provides further details on the change in YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023. 
 Change in Acquisition Cost Ratios Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Increase / (decrease) in acquisition cost ratio points Explanation Property (1.4) Driven mainly by the change in business mix where we have reduced the premium volume in our Personal Property class as result of not renewing a large U.S. homeowners property quota share treaty. This treaty had a higher acquisition cost ratio than our Commercial Property business. 
 Casualty 1.6 Same trends as noted for Q3 2024, coupled with the change in business mix. The increase was partially offset by lower acquisition costs from the Motor Liability class due to a higher proportion of excess of loss treaties, which have lower ceding commission rate than quota share reinsurance treaties, in addition to the lower acquisition cost ratio from the General Liability class as noted for Q3 2024. 
 Other 0.1 No significant change.

Ratio Analysis 
 
 The following table provides our underwriting ratios by line of business for the respective periods: 

Three months ended September 30 Three months ended September 30 2024 2023 Property Casualty Other Total Property Casualty Other Total Loss ratio 112.4 52.7 56.1 61.3 54.1 67.4 45.6 59.4 Acquisition cost ratio 19.9 34.0 28.4 30.4 17.7 31.9 28.2 28.8 Composite ratio 132.3 86.7 84.5 91.7 71.8 99.3 73.8 88.2 Underwriting expense ratio 4.2 3.0 Combined ratio 95.9 91.2 
 
 Our combined ratio increased by 4.7 percentage points for the current quarter compared to Q3 2023 driven by higher loss ratio, acquisition cost ratio and underwriting expense ratio. The underwriting expense ratio increased primarily due to an increase in fixed underwriting expenses - see G A Expenses below.

 Our combined ratio increased by 2.4 percentage points for YTD 2024 compared to same period in 2023 for same reason as noted for Q3 2024. 

General and Administrative G A Expenses 
 
 The breakdown of our G A expenses between underwriting and corporate functions was as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 Underwriting expenses 6,073 4,639 18,223 14,046 Corporate expenses 4,253 3,266 13,334 13,820 General and administrative expenses 10,326 7,905 31,557 27,866 
 
 G A increased by 30.6 for Q3 2024, compared to Q3 2023. The increase was driven by: 
 
 Underwriting expenses : Increased by 1.4 million or 30.9 , predominantly due to an increase in headcount to drive business growth, coupled with an increase in professional fees, office expenses, and outsourced services relating to underwriting activities. 
 
 Corporate expenses : Increased by 1.0 million or 30.2 , predominantly due to an increase in personnel costs, including share-based compensation costs, coupled with an increase in professional fees and office overhead costs, including information technology systems and support. 
 35 

Return to table of contents 

G A increased by 13.2 for YTD 2024, compared to same period in 2023. The increase was driven by: 
 
 Underwriting expenses : Increased by 4.2 million or 29.7 , for the same reason as noted for Q3 2024. Further, YTD 2023 included a bad debt charge of 0.6 million, with no bad debt charge during YTD 2024. 
 
 Corporate expenses : Decreased by 0.5 million or 3.5 , driven mainly by non-recurring severance costs included in YTD 2023 and lower outside legal costs following the hiring of our new General Counsel in April 2023. This was partially offset by an increase in personnel costs, including share-based compensation costs, and office overhead costs. 

Total Investment Income 
 
 A summary of our total investment income is as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest and dividend income, net of withholding taxes and other expenses 8,244 9,513 24,935 27,004 Net realized and unrealized gains on other investments (see Note 4) (2,555) (324) (2,299) Net investment-related income

 Net investment-related income 
 
 Our net investment-related income increased by 18.5 compared to Q3 2023, and by a nominal change compared to YTD 2023, mainly driven by lower net realized and unrealized gains (losses) from our Innovation portfolio. This was partially offset by the decrease in interest income earned from restricted cash and cash equivalents mainly due to the decrease in the outstanding collateral balance during both periods. 
 
 Share of Solasglas net income 
 
 For Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, Solasglas reported a net gain of 5.2 and 11.9 , respectively, compared to a net loss of 0.6 and a net gain of 9.1 for Q3 2023 and YTD 2023, respectively. The following table provides a breakdown of the gross and net investment return for Solasglas.

 For Q3 2024, the significant contributors to Solasglas investment return were long positions in Green Brick Partners (GRBK), gold, and Solvay (Belgium: SOLB). The largest detractors were a short basket to hedge home building exposure, equity index hedges, and a separate housing-related, single-name short position.

 At September 30, 2024, our total investments increased by 139.3 million, or 41.9 , to 471.4 million from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by 96.6 million of net contributions into Solasglas, coupled with the net investment return for YTD 2024 The contributions were funded partially from cash flow from operations and partially from the release of restricted cash. 
 
 Investments in Solasglas 
 
 DME Advisors reports the composition of Solasglas portfolio on a delta-adjusted basis, which it believes is the appropriate manner to assess the exposure and profile of investments and reflects how it manages the portfolio. An option s delta is the option price s sensitivity to the underlying stock (or commodity) price. The delta-adjusted basis is the number of shares or contracts underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock (or commodity) price. 
 
 The following table represents the composition of Solasglas investments: 
 September 30 December 31 2024 2023 Long Short Long Short Equities and related derivatives 85.2 53.9 90.2 53.8 Private and unlisted equity securities 1.7 2.0 Debt instruments 0.2 0.3 Total 87.1 53.9 92.5 53.8 
 
 The above exposure analysis does not include cash (U.S. dollar and foreign currencies), gold and other commodities, credit default swaps, sovereign debt, foreign currency derivatives, interest rate derivatives, inflation swaps and other macro positions. Under this methodology, a total return swap s exposure is reported at its full notional amount and options are reported at their delta-adjusted basis. At September 30, 2024, Solasglas exposure to gold on a delta-adjusted basis was 7.4 (2023: 11.2 ). 
 
 At September 30, 2024, 95.2 of Solasglas portfolio was valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level 1), 3.6 was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and a nominal amount was composed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). At September 30, 2024, 1.2 of Solasglas portfolio consisted of private equity funds valued using the funds net asset values as a practical expedient.

Return to table of contents 

Other Investments 
 
 The other investment holdings relate to private investments made by Innovations. The marginal increase since December 31, 2023, is due to new investments of 0.8 million, partially offset by an impairment charge for certain private debt securities during YTD 2024 (see Note 4). 
 
 Restricted cash and cash equivalents 
 
 We use our restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily for funding trusts and letters of credit issued to our ceding insurers. Our restricted cash decreased by 37.6 million, or 6.2 , from 604.6 million at December 31, 2023, to 567.1 million at September 30, 2024, primarily due to release of collateral from our ceding insurers relating to legacy contracts in run-off. 
 
 Reinsurance balances receivable 
 
 Our reinsurance balances receivable increased by 99.3 million, or 16.0 , to 718.7 million from 619.4 million at December 31, 2023. This was driven primarily by 72.3 million increase in premiums receivable, net of collections, and 27.8 million in funds withheld from new and renewed reinsurance treaties. 
 
 Loss and LAE Reserves; Loss and LAE Recoverable 
 
 Our reserves for loss and LAE by lines of business were as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Case Reserves IBNR Total Case Reserves IBNR Total Property 50,739 114,352 165,091 24,181 41,056 65,237 Casualty 106,667 241,139 347,806 136,713 299,933 436,646 Other 58,794 239,461 298,255 28,156 131,515 159,671 Total 216,200 594,952 811,152 189,050 472,504 661,554 
 
 Our total gross loss and LAE reserves increased by 149.6 million, or 22.6 , to 811.2 million from 661.6 million at December 31, 2023, driven by the increase in earned premium from the renewal of reinsurance treaties and new business, coupled with an increase in loss ratio. This was offset partially by paid losses during YTD 2024. See Note 7 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves of the financial statements for a summary of changes in outstanding loss and LAE reserves and a description of prior period loss developments. 
 
 Our total loss and LAE recoverable increased by 40.3 million, or 156.7 , to 65.9 million from 25.7 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was driven mainly by the estimated loss recoveries on the Baltimore Bridge loss event, the Taiwan earthquake (gross losses were mostly retroceded), and the increase in quota share retrocessions for Other Specialty business due to growth from inward premiums. See Note 8 Retrocession of the financial statements for a description of the credit risk associated with our retrocessionaires. 
 
 Probable Maximum Loss PML 
 
 At October 1, 2024, our estimated largest PML at a 1-in-250-year return period for a single event, and in aggregate, was 99.8 million and 109.7 million, respectively, both relating to the peril of North Atlantic Hurricane, compared to 99.9 million and 109.2 million, respectively, at July 1, 2024.

 Debt 
 
 Our total debt decreased by 10.7 million, or 14.6 , to 62.6 million from 73.3 million at December 31, 2023 due to a voluntary 10.0 million repayment in addition to quarterly installments. Refer to Note 9 Debt and Credit Facil ities of the financial statements for further information. 
 
 Total shareholders equity 
 
 Total shareholders equity increased by 67.3 million to 663.4 million, compared to 596.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the net income of 70.2 million reported for the period, coupled with share-based compensation adjustment to additional paid-in capital. This was partially offset by 7.5 million of share repurchases in the open market at an average price of 13.68 per share (see Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities a nd U se of Proceeds ).

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section included in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K for a general discussion of our liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds: 
 Nine months ended September 30 2024 2023 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 81,970 (14,630) Investing activities (97,222) (22,548) Financing activities (19,364) (5,292) Effect of currency exchange on cash (1) 
 619 (152) Net cash outflows (33,997) (42,622) Cash, beginning of period 655,730 706,548 Cash, end of period 621,733 663,926 
 (1) Cash includes unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents - see Note 5 of the financial statements . 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities 
 
 The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven mainly by the ebb and flow from our underwriting activities, which may vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of business, the nature of underwriting opportunities available and volume of claims submitted to us by our cedents. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities 
 
 The increase in cash used for investing activities was driven mainly by the net contribution of 96.6 million in Solasglas for YTD 2024 compared to a net contribution of 23.0 million during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities 
 
 The increase in cash used in our financing activities was driven mainly by 7.5 million of share repurchases and 11.9 million of debt repayments during YTD 2024, compared to the debt refinancing in YTD 2023 in which we issued 75.0 million of debt to repay 62.1 million of the outstanding convertible senior notes, coupled with 17.2 million of repurchases of these notes. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 The following table summarizes our debt and capital structure: 
 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Debt - outstanding principal 62,187 74,062 Shareholders equity 
 663,418 596,095 Ratio of debt to shareholders equity 
 9.4 12.4 
 
 The debt to shareholders equity provides an indication of our leverage and capital structure, along with some insights into our financial strength. In addition to the above capital, we also have LOC facilities to support our reinsurance business operations where we are not licensed or admitted as a reinsurer.

Ordinary Shares 
 
 At September 30, 2024, there were 34,832,493 outstanding ordinary shares, a decrease of 504,239 since December 31, 2023, mainly due to 547,402 of share repurchases offset partially by issuance of RSs and ordinary shares for vested RSUs, net of forfeitures. 
 
 We expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business strategy for the foreseeable future. However, to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we require additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, we have renewed our 200.0 million shelf registration by filing the Form S-3 registration statement with the SEC, which became effective on July 5, 2024, and will expire on July 1, 2027. 
 
 Secured LOC Facilities 
 
 As disclosed in Note 9 Debt and Credit Facilities of Q3 2024 Financials, the 275 million committed capacity under the Citi LOC agreement terminated on August 20, 2024. However, Citi continues providing the Citi LOC on an uncommitted basis. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our contractual obligations and commitments by period due were as follows: 
 Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Total Operating activities

 (1) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual liabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain. 
 (2) See Note 9 Debt and Credit Facilities of the financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and have required management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those described in Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K, cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying assumptions or estimates. In that case, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. The most significant estimates relate to: premium revenues and risk transfer, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, investment impairments, allowances for credit losses, and share-based compensation. 
 
 We believe that the critical accounting estimates discussion in Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results on Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K continues to describe the significant estimates and judgments included in the preparation of these financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 At September 30, 2024, there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we expect could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies of the Q3 2024 Financials.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. 
 
 Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal controls over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the Company s systems evolve with its business.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution procedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our reinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an agreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing contractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 Our Board has adopted a share repurchase plan (the Plan ).

Any shares repurchased are canceled immediately upon repurchase. We are not required to repurchase any of the ordinary shares. The Plan may be modified, suspended, or terminated at the election of our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. 

The table below details the share repurchases that were made under the Plan during the three months ended September 30, 2024:
