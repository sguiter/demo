COUNTY (the Complaint on November 14, 2022 . The Complaint alleges that former employees would place an order

the customer would sell that product to OZOP s customers at a price marked up from the price for which the customer purchased from
OZOP to the benefit of Defendants and to the detriment of OZOP, their employer at the time. The Complaint further alleges that
the former employees falsely represented that the price the customer was obtaining from other suppliers and therefore was willing to
pay for OZOP product decreased, which allowed them to use the customer to then sell additional product to OZOP s customers at increasingly
larger margins, thus further wrongfully enriching themselves to the detriment of their employer, OZOP. The lawsuit also alleges that
the employees were also making false statements to Ozop s customers regarding the financial condition of Ozop and the lack of module
inventory.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and
operating results during the periods included in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, as well as information
relating to the plans of our current management. This report includes forward-looking statements. Generally, the words believes, 
 anticipates, may, will, should, expect, intend, estimate, 
 continue, and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the matters set forth in this report or other reports
or documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ
materially from those projected. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date
hereof. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 

While
our financial statements are presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time, our auditors have raised a substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Although
the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future
results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the
United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments,
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments,
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of
the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial
statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates. 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Sales
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included 728,640, pursuant to the YHS Settlement. Excluding this, sales of sourced and
distributed products (solar products) were significantly lower for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company believes the lower revenues were due to higher interest rates affecting homeowners 
ability and desire for residential rooftop solar installations as well as competitors lowering their selling prices to try to capture
a part of the lower demand. These factors also resulted in our customers having excess inventory on hand. Design and installation revenues
increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the Company received additional and larger installation jobs. 

Cost
of sales 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized 50,863 and 989,955, respectively, of cost of sales, compared

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reviewed its inventory valuation to determine if the historical cost of its solar
panels was less than their net realizable value. Management also considers, if applicable, other factors, including known trends, market
conditions, and other such issues. Based on current market conditions related to solar panels including but not limited to reduced selling
prices in the industry and the abundance of inventory supply in the market, management determined that the net realizable value of certain
of the Company s inventory required a lower of cost or market adjustment of 625,000 (the Inventory Adjustment to
the historical cost of inventory purchased. 

Gross
margin of sourced and distributed products was 15 and 8.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared
to 18.4 and 12.1 (prior to the Inventory Adjustment) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The downward
trend in gross profit margin is due to the continued decline in selling price because of market competition. 

Design
and installation cost of sales is comprised of OED s labor costs for each job.

Professional
and consulting fees increased slightly for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023, and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
is due to the expiration of certain consulting contracts and legal fees related to the YHS litigation. These decreases were partially
offset by increases in general legal expenses and auditing fees. 

Advertising
and marketing expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Rent
and office expense (including storage, supplies, utilities, and internet costs) increased for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is the result of 71,208, for the current nine months of expenses incurred by OES
for storage fees, partially offset by decreased rent expense that on March 1, 2023, OES has subleased the Carlsbad office and warehouse
to a third party. Effective May 7, 2024, there is not any additional storage charges.

Insurance
expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The decrease was the result of the Company not renewing the credit insurance policy for OES, which terminated April 30, 2024. 

Termination
costs of 1,755,082 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was a result of storage fees for goods that remained at a
third-party warehouse and purchase order termination fees charged by the Company s solar panel supplier, all of which was in connection
with an early termination of vendor agreement. 

Other
(Income) Expenses

The
increase in other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023,
is primarily a result of the Company recognizing a gain of 3,304,989 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, on the change in
the fair value of derivatives compared to a loss of 96,180 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September

on the change in the fair value of derivatives. Additionally for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain
of 271,360 on the settlement with YHS. 

Net
loss 

Net
loss attributable to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2,093,083 and 4,808,669, respectively,
compared to 321,058 and 6,281,346, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was a combination of a decrease in gross profit of 22,698,
reduced operating expenses of 1,674,335 (mostly related to the loss associated with early termination of vendor agreement of 1,755,082
for the three months ended September 30, 2023), and increased other expenses, net, of 3,418,300, as described above. The change for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was a combination of an increase in gross

agreement of 1,755,082 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023), and increased other expenses, net, of 773,012, as described above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of 223,479,149 and a working capital deficit of 30,760,584 (including derivative liabilities of 666,677). As of September
30, 2024, the Company was in default of 3,315,000 plus accrued interest on debt instruments due to non-payment upon maturity dates.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for one year from
the date of the issuance of these financial statements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

7 

Currently,
our current capital and our other existing resources will be sufficient to provide the working capital needed for our current business,
however, additional capital will be required to meet our debt obligations, and to further expand our business. We may be unable to obtain
the additional capital required. If we are unable to generate capital or raise additional funds when required, it will have a negative
impact on our business development and financial results. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern as well as our recurring losses from operations, deficit in equity, and the need to raise additional capital to fund operations.
This going concern could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities. Management s
plans in regard to these factors are discussed in Note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements filed herein. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we primarily funded our business operations with the existing cash on hand as of January 1,
2024, cash received from accounts receivable, and 979,048 received from sales of common stock. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,354,636 as compared to 1,446,029 as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had
current liabilities of 32,398,711 (including 666,677 of derivative liabilities), compared to current assets of 1,638,127, which resulted
in a working capital deficit of 30,760,584. The current liabilities are comprised of accounts payable, accrued expenses, convertible
debt, derivative liabilities, lease obligations, deferred liability, notes payable and liabilities of discontinued operations. 

Operating
Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1,059,327 compared to 901,293 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of 4,808,669,
the gain on the change in fair value of derivatives of 549,401, adjusted by non-cash items of interest expense of 998,970, and amortization
and depreciation of 160,988. Net changes of 3,142,358 in operating assets and liabilities reduced the cash used in operating activities. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of 6,281,346,
and the gain on the change in fair value of derivatives of 1,724,084, adjusted by non-cash items of the termination expense of 1,755,082,
interest expense of 1,138,067, the inventory write-down of 625,000 and amortization and depreciation of 172,470. Net changes of 3,429,606
in operating assets and liabilities reduced the cash used in operating activities. 

Investing
Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 the net cash used in investing activities was 11,114 and 2,162, respectively, primarily
due to purchase of office and computer equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net cash provided by financing activities was 979,048, net of issuance costs, from the
sales of common stock to GHS. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net cash provided by financing activities was 500,537. During the nine months ended September
30, 2023, we received 1,200,537, net of issuance costs, from the sales of common stock to GHS. During the nine months ended September
30, 2023, we made payments of 700,000 for notes payable. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
significant accounting policies are described in more details in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgement and estimates used in the preparation
of our financial statements: 

8 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

OFF
BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support
and credit risk support or other benefits. 

Item

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation
of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for
the reasons discussed below. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30,
2024, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. 
 We do not have an Audit
 Committee While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee,
 including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statement. Currently
 the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee and does not include a member that is considered to be independent
 of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

2. 
 We did not maintain appropriate
 cash controls As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting
 for cash, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signatures on the Company s
 bank accounts. 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
