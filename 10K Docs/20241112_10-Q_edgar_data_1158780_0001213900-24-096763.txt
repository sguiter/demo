Overview 

We
are a biotechnology company with an advanced cell-based technology platform. We have developed a unique three-dimensional, or 3D, technology
platform for cell expansion with an industrial scale in-house Good Manufacturing Practice, cell manufacturing facility. We are utilizing
our technology in the fields of regenerative medicine, immunotherapy, food tech, CDMO, and agtech, and plan to utilize it in industries
and verticals that have a need for our mass scale and cost-effective cell expansion platform via partnerships, joint ventures, licensing
agreements and other types of collaborations. 

Our
operations are focused on the research, development and manufacturing of cell-based products and the business development of cell therapeutics
and cell-based technologies, providing potential solutions for various industries. 

Cell
Therapy 

We
use our advanced cell-based technology platform in the field of regenerative medicine to develop placenta-based cell therapy product
candidates for the treatment of inflammatory, muscle injuries and hematologic conditions. Recently, we have also launched a novel immunotherapy
platform. 

PLX
Cells : Our PLX cells are adherent stromal cells that are expanded using our 3D platform. Our PLX cells can be administered to patients
off-the-shelf, without blood or tissue matching or additional manipulation prior to administration. PLX cells are believed to release
a range of therapeutic proteins in response to the patient s condition. 

In
the pharmaceutical area, we have focused on several indications utilizing our product candidates, including, but not limited to, muscle
recovery following surgery for hip fracture, incomplete recovery following bone marrow transplantation, critical limb ischemia, or CLI,
Chronic Graft versus Host Disease and a potential treatment for Hematopoietic Acute Radiation Syndrome, or H-ARS. Some of these studies
have been completed while others are still ongoing. We believe that each of these indications is a severe unmet medical need. 

In
July 2023, we announced that we signed a three-year 4.2 million contract with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, or NIAID, which is part of the NIH. Under such contract, we will collaborate with the U.S. Department of Defense s Armed
Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, or AFRRI, and the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, or USUHS, in Maryland, U.S.A.,
to further advance the development of our PLX-R18 cell therapy as a potential novel treatment for H-ARS, a deadly disease that can result
from nuclear disasters and radiation exposure. 

18 

Immunotherapy
MAIT cells : In May 2024, we launched a novel allogenic immunotherapy platform utilizing MAIT cells specifically designed to address
solid tumors - a critical area in medicine where effective treatments are currently insufficient. We believe that our MAIT cells, isolated
from the human placenta, offer substantial potential benefits compared to conventional T-cells. 

MAIT
cells are potent effector cells, potentially targeting tumors through multiple mechanisms while expressing high levels of various chemokine
receptors, which facilitate their migration directly to tumor sites. Furthermore, unlike conventional autologous T-cells typically collected
from peripheral blood, our MAIT cells are designed to be allogenic universal product. Benefiting with very restricted T-cell receptor,
the MAIT cells minimize their likelihood of inducing Graft versus Host Disease, a significant advantage over other potential allogeneic
products. We are aiming to design the MAIT cells to potentially show better persistence in the body for a longer duration, enhancing
their therapeutic efficacy. 

In
April 2024, we unveiled a novel method for expansion of immune cells using proprietary technology and announced we were granted a new
U.S. patent titled, System and Methods for Immune Cells Expansion and Activation in Large Scale. This innovative approach
ensures that the produced immune cells retain their integrity, functionality, and therapeutic efficacy, thus offering a promising solution
to meet the escalating demand for advanced cell-based therapies for immune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. 

PluriCDMO 

In
January 2024, we launched a new business division offering cell therapy manufacturing services as a CDMO: PluriCDMO . PluriCDMO 
offers CDMO services to companies from early preclinical development, through late-stage clinical trials and commercialization, with
a mission to deliver high-quality, essential therapies to patients. We have signed several agreements with clients and are currently
generating revenues from PluriCDMO . 

AgTech

We
are actively involved in several initiatives leveraged by Pluri s 3D cell expansion in the agtech field, such as: (a) cell-based
coffee business activity through our PluriAgtech business vertical, which is incorporated into our wholly owned subsidiary, Coffeesai
Ltd., (b) an innovative proof-of-concept, or POC, collaboration with ICL Group Ltd., a leading global specialty minerals company, to
revolutionize bio stimulant delivery and enhance yield sustainably, and (c) a strategic POC agreement with a leading international agriculture
corporation which is intended to boost the global vegetable product supply, streamline supply chains, and combat global climate change,
while ensuring a natural and a more sustainable future for agriculture. 

In
March 2024, we announced an important expansion to our intellectual property portfolio with a new patent approval from the Israel Patent
Office, that is designed to reshape the agricultural technology landscape. The patent represents a major breakthrough in our proprietary
3D bioreactor technology, enabling efficient cultivation of plant cells across various applications, from sustainable agriculture to
critical healthcare solutions. 

Food
Tech 

In
2022, we announced the establishment of a joint venture with Tnuva Food Industries Agricultural Cooperative in Israel Ltd., or
Tnuva, Ever After Foods (previously Plurinuva Ltd.), which is incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel, with the purpose of
developing cultivated meat products of all kinds and types. 

Leveraging
Pluri s innovative technology, Ever After Foods has rapidly advanced its scalable production platform, developing a business-to-business,
or B2B, version of its proprietary technology system, Ever After Foods has demonstrated the natural production of muscle and fat tissues
for various animal cells, ensuring taste, feel, and texture akin to conventional animal-derived meat. 

In
June 2024, we entered into a share purchase agreement by and among Ever After Foods, Tnuva, and certain other international strategic
investors, pursuant to which Ever After Foods issued and sold, ordinary shares in a private placement offering, or the Offering, for
aggregate gross proceeds of 10 million. As part of the Offering, we invested 1.25 million. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiary,
Pluri Biotech Ltd., and Ever After Foods executed an Amended and Restated Technology License Agreement, dated June
12, 2024, or the Amended License. The Amended License amended the parties existing license agreement dated as of February 23,
2022, to expand the scope of the license to include fish and seafood. 

The
 10 million funding round is intended to support Ever After Foods B2B technology platform, positioning it as a sustainable technology
enabler. Following the closing of the Offering, the Subsidiary holds approximately 69 of Ever After Foods.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023. 

Revenues 

Revenues
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 326,000, as compared to 54,000 for the three-month period ended September
30, 2023. Revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were mainly related to services provided to CDMO clients and revenues
related to a POC, collaboration with a leading international agriculture corporation in the agtech field. Revenues for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2023 were mainly related to services provided to a CDMO client in the field of process and product development.
The increase in revenues is mainly attributed to the launch of new business verticals, specifically in the CDMO and agtech fields. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost of revenues for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024 was 126,000. Cost of revenues includes (1) manufacturing costs relates to our CDMO and agtech fields,
which primary consist of materials, personnel-related and overhead costs, and (2) royalties which we are obligated to pay to the European
Investment Bank, or EIB, according to the finance agreement, or the EIB Finance Agreement, executed with the EIB by us, Pluri Biotech
Ltd. and Pluristem GmbH in April 2020. We had no cost of revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Research
and Development Expenses, Net 

R D expenses, net (costs
less participation by the IIA, Horizon Europe and the NIAID) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 3 from
 2,993,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, to 2,889,000. The decrease is mainly attributed to (1) a decrease in
salaries and a related to reduction in head count of 9 R D employees (90 R D employees on September 30, 2024, compared to 99 R D
employees on September 30, 2023) as a result of our cost reduction and efficiency plans, and (2) an increase in participation grants from
the NIAID contract, partially offset by (1) an increase in material purchases in accordance with our manufacturing needs and plans, and
(2) an increase related to subcontractors activity in NIAID and immunotherapy projects. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3 from 2,438,000 for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2023 to 2,509,000 mainly due to: (1) an increase in salaries and related expenses due to the reinstatement of the
salary of Mr. Yaky Yanay, our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO (following his salary reduction from January 2023 through December 2023,
whereby he waived 75 of his salary and converted it to restricted stock units, or RSUs, and options), (2) an increase in bonus expenses
for certain employees, including our CEO and Mrs. Chen Franco-Yehuda, our former Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, for certain performance-based
bonuses as defined in their employment agreement, (3) an increase in share-based compensation expenses related to RSUs and options which
were granted during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 to officers and consultants, and (4) an increase in expenses related to corporate
activities, such as investor relations and public relations, partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expenses related
to RSU expenses amortization over time. 

Other
Financial Income (expenses), net 

Other
financial income (expenses), net, decreased from 493,000 in financial income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to
 621,000 in financial expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. This decrease is mainly attributed to exchange rate
differences expenses related to the EIB loan following fluctuation between the U.S. dollar against the Euro and from a decrease related
to interest on deposits, due to a decrease in interest rates, offset by exchange rates income related to the New Israeli Shekel, or NIS,
deposits following the strength of the NIS against the U.S. dollar. 

20 

Interest
Expenses 

Interest
expenses related to our outstanding loan received from the EIB and all changes during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024
compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 are attributable solely to exchange rate differences of the Euro compared
to the U.S. dollar. 

Net
Loss 

Net loss for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024 was 6,036,000 compared to net loss of 5,098,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023.
The increase is mainly due to the increase in financial expenses, net, as well as for the reasons mentioned above, partially offset by
an increase in income due to the launch of our new businesses, such as the CDMO and agtech fields. Net loss per share attributed to shareholders
for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 1.08 as compared to 0.96 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023.
We had net loss attributed to our non-controlling interest in Ever After Foods for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 of
 154,000. 

For
the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had weighted average common shares outstanding of 5,459,236 and 5,166,471,
respectively, which were used in the computations of net loss per share for the three-month period. 

The
increase in weighted average common shares outstanding reflects the issuance of additional shares upon the vesting of RSUs and restricted
shares issued to directors, employees and consultants. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024,
our total current assets were 27,032,000 and total current liabilities were 4,583,000. On September 30, 2024, we had a working capital
surplus of 22,449,000, total equity (deficit) of 63,000), out of which 5,220,000 is attributed to the non-controlling interest in
Ever After Foods, and an accumulated deficit of 426,354,000. 

Our
cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024 amounted to 3,563,000, compared to 5,548,000 as of September
30, 2023, and compared to 7,037,000 as of June 30, 2024. Cash balances changed in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023 for the reasons presented below. 

Net
cash used for operating activities was 4,064,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5,857,000 in the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in operating activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily
of payments of fees to our suppliers, subcontractors, professional services providers and consultants, and payments of salaries to our
employees, partially offset by grants from the IIA, the Horizon Europe program, and funds received from the NIAID contract. 

Investing
activities provided cash of 585,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided of 5,802,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The investing activities in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 consisted
primarily of the proceeds from withdrawal of short-term deposits, net of 793,000 and 5,905,000, respectively. 

We
had no financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 

21 

On
December 14, 2022, our CEO agreed to forgo, starting January 1, 2023, 375,000 of his annual cash salary
for the next twelve months in return for equity grants, issuable under our existing equity compensation plans. In that regard, we granted
Mr. Yanay (i) 41,853 RSUs, vesting ratably each month, and (ii) options to purchase 41,853 common shares, vesting ratably each month,
with a term of 3 years, at an exercise price of 8.96 per share. In addition, the Board of Directors also agreed to grant Mr. Yanay options
to purchase 187,500 common shares, with a term of 3 years, with the following terms: (i) options to purchase 62,500 common shares at
an exercise price of 12.48 per share, 50 vesting on June 30, 2023 and 50 vesting on December 31, 2023, (ii) options to purchase 62,500
common shares at an exercise price of 16.64 per share, 50 vesting on June 30, 2023 and 50 vesting on December 31, 2023, and (iii)
options to purchase 62,500 common shares at an exercise price of 20.8 per share, 50 vesting on June 30, 2023 and 50 vesting on December
31, 2023. All options were granted in January 2023 and will expire three years from the later of the vesting date or the date which the
Company increased its authorized share capital. 

In
April 2020, we and our subsidiaries, Pluri Biotech Ltd. and Pluristem GmbH, executed the EIB Finance Agreement for non-dilutive funding
of up to 50 million in the aggregate, payable in three tranches. The proceeds from the EIB Finance Agreement were intended to support
our R D in the European Union to further advance our regenerative cell therapy platform, and to bring the products in our pipeline
to market. The term of the project was three years commencing on January 1, 2020. 

During
June 2021, we received the first tranche in the amount of 20 million pursuant to the EIB Finance Agreement. The amount received
is due to be repaid on June 1, 2026, and bears annual interest of 4 to be paid together with the principal of the loan. As of September
30, 2024, the interest accrued was in the amount of approximately 2.6 million. In addition to the interest payable, the EIB is
also entitled to royalty payments, pro-rated to the amount disbursed from the EIB loan, on our consolidated revenues beginning in the
fiscal year 2024 up to and including its fiscal year 2030, in an amount equal to up to 2.3 of our consolidated revenues below 350 million,
1.2 of our consolidated revenues between 350 million and 500 million and 0.2 of our consolidated revenues exceeding 500 million.
As the project term ended on December 31, 2022, we do not expect to receive additional funds pursuant to the EIB Finance Agreement. 

On
July 11, 2023, we signed a three-year 4.2 million contract with the NIAID, which is part of the NIH. We will collaborate with the U.S.
Department of Defense s, or DoD s, AFRRI and USUHS to further advance the development of our PLX-R18 cell therapy as a potential
novel treatment for H-ARS. H-ARS is a deadly disease that can result from nuclear disasters and radiation exposure. The period of performance
of this contract will be from July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024, with an optional extension for an additional two-year period. 

On
June 6, 2024, the NIAID exercised its option for year two of the three-year 4.2 million contract. During the 12 months period from July
1, 2024 through June 30, 2025, the NIAID will provide us with 1.4 million to manufacture the PLX-R18 cell therapy and to conduct both
in vitro and in vivo studies to develop PLX-R18 as a potential novel treatment for hematopoietic complications of the H-ARS. As of September
30, 2024, we have received from the NIAID approximately 1.6 million and as of September 30, 2024 we expect to receive an additional
amount of approximately 2.2 million for activities conducted by that date. 

On
February 13, 2024, we entered into a sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, or A.G.P., as agent,
pursuant to which we may issue and sell our common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 10 million, from time to time
through A.G.P. As of November 12, 2024, we have sold an aggregate of 42,729 common shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement at an average
price of 5.93 per share. 

On
October 28, 2024, we announced that the IIA will fund our collaboration with Bar-Ilan University Research and Development Company Ltd.,
or BIRAD, the commercial arm of the Bar-Ilan University in Israel, to support the continued development of MAIT cells. This collaboration
is aimed at advancing innovative allogeneic cell therapies targeting solid tumors and multiple indications. The IIA will fund our collaboration
with BIRAD over the next year with budget approved of approximately 148,000 allocated to us, with an option to fund an additional year.
The goal of this collaboration is to effectively integrate both technologies and advance to preclinical studies. The program does not
include any obligation to pay royalties. 

22 

Non-dilutive
grants 

Israel
Innovation Authority (IIA) 

According
to the IIA grant terms, we are required to pay royalties at a rate of 3 on sales of products and services derived from technology developed
using this and other IIA grants until 100 of the dollar-linked grants amount plus interest are repaid. In the absence of such sales,
no payment is required. Through September 30, 2024, total grants obtained from the IIA aggregated to approximately 27.7 million and
total royalties paid and accrued amounted to 179 thousand. 

In
June 2020, we announced that we were selected as a member of the CRISPR-IL consortium, a group funded by the IIA. CRISPR-IL brings together
the leading experts in life science and computer science from academia, medicine, and industry, to develop AI based end-to-end genome-editing
solutions. These next-generation, multi-species genome editing products for human, plant, and animal DNA, have applications in the pharmaceutical,
agriculture, and aquaculture industries. CRISPR-IL is funded by the IIA with a total budget of approximately 10 million of which, an
amount of approximately 480 thousand was a direct grant allocated to us, for the initial period of 18 months. During October 2021, we
received an approval for an additional grant of approximately 583 thousand from the IIA pursuant to the CRISPR-IL consortium program,
for an additional period of eighteen months. During January 2023, we received approval for an extension of an additional 2 months to
finish the program until June 30, 2023. The CRISPR-IL consortium program does not include any obligation to pay royalties. 

Through
September 30, 2024, we received total grants of approximately 1 million in cash from the IIA pursuant to the CRISPR-IL consortium program,
and we do not expect to receive any additional funds. 

EU
grants - Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe 

On
September 6, 2022, we announced that a 7.5 million non-dilutive grant from the European Union s Horizon program was awarded
to Advanced PeRsOnalized Therapies for Osteoarthritis, or PROTO, an international collaboration led by Charit Berlin Institute
of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies. The goal of the PROTO project is to utilize our PLX-PAD cells in a Phase I/II study for
the treatment of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. 

An
amount of approximately Euro 500,000 (approximately 540,000) will be a direct grant that will be allocated to us. Through September
30, 2024, we received a payment of approximately 185,000 in cash, which relates to the PROTO program. 

The
clinical study, once approved by the regulatory agencies, will be carried out by Charit , together with us and other members of
the international consortium under the leadership of Professor Tobias Winkler, Principal Investigator, at the Berlin Institute of Health
Center of Regenerative Therapies, Julius Wolff Institute and Center for Musculoskeletal Surgery. 

We
have an effective Form S-3 registration statement (File No. 333-273347), filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with the
SEC using a shelf registration process. Under this shelf registration process, we may, from time to time, sell our common
shares, preferred stock and warrants to purchase common shares, and of two or more of such securities, in one or more offerings for an
aggregate initial offering price of 200 million (including amounts sold under the Sales Agreement). 

The
currency of our financial portfolio is mainly in U.S. dollars and we use options contracts and other financial instruments in order to
hedge our exposures to currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For more information, please see Item 7A. - Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk in the 2024 Annual Report. 

Outlook 

We have accumulated a deficit
of 426,354,000 since our inception in May 2001. We do not expect to generate any significant revenues from sales of products in the next
twelve months. We expect to generate revenues from the sale of services in our CDMO activity, from collaboration based on our cell-based
products, and from licenses to use our technology and products. Although we were able to reduce the burn rate significantly in the last
few years, it is unlikely that in the short-term revenues will exceed our costs of operations. 

23 

We
may be required to obtain additional liquidity resources in order to support the commercialization of our products and technology and
maintain our R D activities. 

We
are continually looking for sources of funding, including collaboration with other companies via licensing agreements, joint ventures
and partnerships, and other non-dilutive sources such as our contract with NIAID and DoD, research grants such as the IIA grants and
the European Union grants, and sales of our common shares. 

We
believe that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures - We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed for the
purposes of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
CEO and our CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during
the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed below and in Part I,
 Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2024 Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future
results. 

Our
principal research, development and manufacturing facilities are located in Haifa, Israel and the escalated military conditions of Israel
may cause interruption or suspension of our business operations without warning. 

Our
principal R D and manufacturing facilities are located in Haifa, Israel. Due to the ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Hamas,
Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran and other Arab terrorists groups, there is a high possibility risk that it will turn into a greater
regional conflict in the near future. 

Most
recently, the war has escalated and expanded further from the Northern border of Israel with Lebanon. Consequently, there has been a
major increase in the amount and frequency of the attacks on Israel, and on Haifa in particular. 

According
to the recent guidelines of the Israeli government, the Company s offices in Haifa are open and functioning, however, if the war
will escalate and expand even further, the Israeli government may impose additional restrictions on movement and travel, which will affect
our management and employees ability to effectively perform their daily tasks, and may result in disruptions and delays in some
of our projects. 

Any
hostilities involving Israel, terrorist activities, political instability or violence in the region, or the interruption or curtailment
of trade or transport between Israel and its trading partners could make it more difficult for us to raise capital, if needed in the
future, and adversely affect our operations and results of operations and the market price of our common shares. In addition, to the
extent the IIA no longer makes grants similar to those we have received in the past, it could adversely affect our financial results. 

Furthermore,
certain of our employees may be obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called
up for active military duty at any time. Many Israeli citizens who have served in the army are required to perform reserve duty until
they reach the age of 40 or older, depending upon the nature of their military service. Currently, three of our employees have been called
up for active military duty. 

The
intensity and duration of Israel s current war is difficult to predict, as are such war s economic implications on the Company s
business and operations and on Israel s economy in general. These events may be intertwined with wider macroeconomic indications
of a deterioration of Israel s economic standing, for instance, a downgrade in Israel s credit rating by rating agencies,
which may have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to effectively conduct its operations. 

In
addition, Israeli-based companies and companies doing business with Israel, have been the subject of an economic boycott by members of
the Arab League and certain other predominantly Muslim countries since Israel s establishment. Although Israel has entered into
various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection
with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, we cannot predict whether or in what manner these
problems will be resolved. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing
the level of foreign and local investment. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

During
the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we issued an aggregate of 7,067 restricted common shares to certain of our service providers as
compensation in lieu of cash compensation owed to them for services rendered. 

We
claimed exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for the foregoing transactions
under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
