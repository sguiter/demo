 billion, comprised of a million store impairment charge, million of costs associated with corporate workforce optimization, including severance and employee-related costs, and million of other asset impairments and related charges associated with the discontinuation of certain non-core assets. 
 
 Store impairment charges 
 The Company evaluates its retail store right-of-use and property and equipment assets for impairment at the retail store level, which is the lowest level at which cash flows can be identified. For retail stores where there is an indicator of impairment present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows used in the analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to its estimated fair value which is the greater of the asset group s estimated future cash flows (discounted), or the consideration of what a market participant would pay to lease the assets, net of leasing costs. The Company s estimate of fair value considers historical results, current operating trends, consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. For assets which the Company has determined it will be able to sublease, the estimated future cash flows include the estimated sublease income, net of estimated leasing costs. 
 
 When the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the value of the asset group to its estimated fair value. As the impaired assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily using unobservable inputs as of the measurement date, the assets are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, in connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business, which included evaluating changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health requirements to ensure continued alignment of its retail footprint with consumer needs. In connection with this initiative, in September 2024, the Company determined it plans to close retail stores in 2025. As a result, management determined that 
 15 

million, consisting of a write down of million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and million related to property and equipment. The charge associated with the store impairments was included in the restructuring charges within the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment. Subsequent to the impairment loss, the fair value of the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment were million and million, respectively. 
 
 Corporate workforce optimization costs 
 Corporate workforce optimization costs, including severance and employee-related costs, consist primarily of salary continuation benefits, prorated annual incentive compensation, continuation of health care benefits and outplacement services. Severance and employee-related benefits are determined pursuant to the Company s written severance plans and are recognized when the benefits are determined to be probable of being paid and are reasonably estimable. 
 
 In connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan, the Company recorded corporate workforce optimization costs of million, which were recorded in accrued expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. There were payments made related to these costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The restructuring charge associated with the corporate workforce optimization costs is reflected within the Corporate/Other segment. 
 
 Other asset impairment charges 
 In connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan, the Company also conducted a review of its various strategic assets and determined that it would discontinue the use of certain non-core assets, including certain virtual care services and compounding infusion pharmacies and branches. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted long-lived assets and a long-lived asset impairment test was performed during the third quarter of 2024. The results of the long-lived asset impairment test indicated that the fair value of the impacted assets was lower than their respective carrying values and, accordingly, the Company recorded million of other asset impairments and related charges associated with the discontinuation of these assets in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The asset impairment charges were recorded as reductions to property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. The other asset impairment charges were included in the restructuring charges within the Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segments. Subsequent to the impairment charges, the fair value of the associated long-lived assets was not material. 
 
 The restructuring program is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2025.

 The Company reviewed the securities in the table above and concluded that they are performing assets generating investment income to support the needs of the Company s business. In performing this review, the Company considered factors such as the quality of the investment security based on research performed by the Company s internal credit analysts and external rating agencies and the prospects of realizing the carrying value of the security based on the investment s current prospects for recovery. Unrealized capital losses at September 30, 2024 were generally caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell these securities, and did not believe it was more likely than not that it would be required to sell these securities prior to the anticipated recovery of their amortized cost basis.

These indicators are based upon several factors, including current loan-to-value ratios, current and future property cash flow, property condition, market trends, creditworthiness of the borrower and deal structure. 
 
 Category 1 - Represents loans of superior quality. 
 Categories 2 to 4 - Represent loans where credit risk is minimal to acceptable; however, these loans may display some susceptibility to economic changes. 
 Categories 5 and 6 - Represent loans where credit risk is not substantial, but these loans warrant management s close attention. 
 Category 7 - Represents loans where collections are potentially at risk; if necessary, an impairment is recorded.

 December 9, 2021 2021 Repurchase Program 
 
 Each of the share Repurchase Programs was effective immediately and permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ASR transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. Both the 2022 and 2021 Repurchase Programs can be modified or terminated by the Board at any time. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased an aggregate of million shares of common stock for approximately billion and an aggregate of million shares of common stock for approximately billion, respectively, both pursuant to the 2021 Repurchase Program. This activity includes the share repurchases under the ASR transactions described below. 
 
 Pursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a billion fixed dollar ASR with Morgan Stanley Co. LLC. Upon payment of the billion purchase price on January 4, 2024, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation s common stock equal to of the billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2024. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for billion and a forward contract for billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In March 2024, the Company received approximately million shares of CVS Health Corporation s common stock, representing the remaining of the billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in March 2024. 
 
 Pursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a billion fixed dollar ASR with Citibank, N.A. Upon payment of the billion purchase price on January 4, 2023, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation s common stock equal to of the billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2023. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for billion and a forward contract for billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In February 2023, the Company received approximately million shares of CVS Health Corporation s common stock, representing the remaining of the billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in February 2023. 
 
 At the time they were received, the initial and final receipt of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 The quarterly cash dividend declared by the Board was and per share in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash dividends declared by the Board were and per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. CVS Health Corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Board.

 million and million shares of common stock were outstanding, but were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, because their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. For the same reason, stock options and stock appreciation rights to purchase million and million shares of common stock were outstanding, but were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Guaranty Fund Assessments, Market Stabilization and Other Non-Voluntary Risk Sharing Pools 
 
 Under guaranty fund laws existing in all states, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed (in most states up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the Company participates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of long-term care insurers and life insurers as well as health insurers. The Company s assessments generally are based on a formula relating to the Company s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers. Certain states allow assessments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes. Some states have similar laws relating to health maintenance organizations HMOs and/or other payors such as not-for-profit consumer-governed health plans established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

billion in opioid remediation and million in attorneys fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts are payable over years, beginning in 2023. The agreement also contains injunctive terms relating to the dispensing of opioid medications. The settlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com. 
 
 Upon reaching an agreement in principle in October 2022, the Company concluded that settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities and tribes was probable, and the loss related thereto could be reasonably estimated. As a result of that conclusion, and its assessment of certain other opioid-related claims including those for which the Company reached agreement in August and September 2022, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. Settlement accruals expected to be paid within twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as accrued expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets and settlement accruals expected to be paid greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as other long-term liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 In June 2023, the Company elected to move forward with a final settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, to resolve claims brought by participating states and political subdivisions such as counties, cities, and towns, but not by private plaintiffs, alleging claims beginning as far back as the early 2000s generally concerning the impacts of widespread prescription opioid abuse. The agreement became effective in June 2023. 
 
 states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories are participating in the settlement. A high percentage of eligible subdivisions within the participating states also have elected to join the settlement. The Company has 
 37 

states Florida, West Virginia, New Mexico and Nevada and a high percentage of eligible subdivisions within those states also have elected to participate. 
 
 The final settlement agreement contains certain contingencies related to payment obligations. Because these contingencies are inherently unpredictable, the assessment requires judgments about future events. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from the amount accrued by the Company. 
 
 The State of Maryland has elected not to participate, and thus subdivisions within the State of Maryland may not participate, in the settlement. The State of Maryland has issued a civil subpoena for information from the Company, and litigation is pending with certain subdivisions within the State of Maryland, though in August 2024 the Company reached a settlement with the City of Baltimore for an amount immaterial to the Company. The Company is defending itself against claims made in these cases. 
 
 In December 2022, the Company also agreed to a formal settlement agreement with a leadership group representing tribes throughout the United States. The agreement resolves substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by such tribes. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the settlement is million in opioid remediation and million in attorneys fees and costs, payable over years. The Company also entered into a separate settlement with the Cherokee Nation. 
 
 These settlements resolve a majority of the cases against the Company that had been pending in the consolidated multidistrict litigation captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. However, certain opioid-related cases against the Company remain pending in the multidistrict litigation and in various state courts, including those brought by non-participating subdivisions, including the City of Philadelphia, and private parties such as hospitals and third-party payors. The Company continues to defend those cases. 
 
 In November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a judgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of million to be paid over years and also ordered certain injunctive relief. The Company is appealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. 
 
 Because of the many uncertainties associated with any settlement arrangement or other resolution of opioid-related litigation matters, and because the Company continues to actively defend ongoing litigation for which it believes it has defenses and assertions that have merit, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioid-related litigation matters at this time. The outcome of these legal matters could have a material effect on the Company s business, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows. 
 
 In January 2020, the DOJ served the Company with a DEA administrative subpoena. The subpoena seeks documents relating to practices with respect to prescription opioids and other controlled substances at CVS pharmacy locations concerning potential violations of the federal Controlled Substances Act and the federal False Claims Act. The DOJ subsequently served additional DEA administrative subpoenas relating to controlled substances. The DOJ also served the Company with additional CIDs relating to controlled substances. The Company is providing documents and information in response to these matters. 
 
 Prescription Processing Litigation and Investigations 
 
 The Company is named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is subject to a number of investigations concerning its prescription processing practices, including related to billing government payors for prescriptions, and the following: 
 
 U.S. ex rel. Bassan et al. v. Omnicare, Inc. and CVS Health Corp. (U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York). In December 2019, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York filed a complaint-in-intervention in this previously sealed qui tam case. The complaint alleges that for certain non-skilled nursing facilities, Omnicare improperly filled prescriptions beyond one year where a valid prescription did not exist and that these dispensing events violated the federal False Claims Act. The Company is defending itself against these claims. 
 
 U.S. ex rel. Gill et al. v. CVS Health Corp. et al. (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois). In July 2022, the Delaware Attorney General s Office moved for partial intervention as to allegations under the Delaware false claims act related to not escheating alleged overpayments in this previously sealed qui tam case. The federal government and the remaining states declined to intervene on other additional theories in the relator s complaint. The Company is defending itself against all of the claims.

demands for inspection of books and records pursuant to Delaware General Corporation Law Section 220 Section 220 demands ), as well as a derivative complaint Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust v. Lynch, et al. that was filed in January 2023, which the defendants have moved to dismiss. The Section 220 demands and the complaint purport to be related to potential breaches of fiduciary duties by the Board in relation to certain matters concerning opioids. Following the Company s response to the Section 220 demands, two of the three stockholders sent demand letters to the Board containing allegations substantially similar to those made in the earlier Section 220 demands and the derivative matter, and requested that it take certain actions, including consideration of its governance and policies with respect to controlled substances. The Board deferred consideration of these two demands until after the motion to dismiss the 
 40 

demands in light of the Gusinsky dismissal. 
 
 In January 2022, a shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Northern District of Illinois, Allison v. Oak Street Health, Inc., et al. Defendants include Oak Street Health and certain of its pre-acquisition officers and directors. The putative plaintiffs assert causes of action under various securities laws premised on allegations that defendants made omissions and misrepresentations to investors relating to marketing conduct they allege may violate the False Claims Act. In May 2024, the parties reached agreement in principle to settle this action for an amount immaterial to the Company. The court preliminarily approved the settlement in September 2024, and the final approval hearing has been scheduled for December 2024. 
 
 Beginning in July 2024, purported class action complaints, as well as multiple derivative complaints, were filed by putative plaintiffs against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action under federal securities laws and state law that are premised on allegations that the defendants made certain omissions and misrepresentations relating to the profitability of the Health Care Benefits segment. The purported class actions were filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Nixon v. CVS Health Corporation, et al . and Tatone v. CVS Health Corporation, et al. , as were of the pending derivative cases, Kaufmann v. Lynch, et al. , and Silva v. Lynch, et al . derivative cases were filed in the District of Rhode Island, Duffy v. Lynch, et al . and Lovoi v. Lynch, et al ., 
 and were filed in Rhode Island Superior Court, Goff v. Lynch, et al. and Brodin v. Lynch, et al . The Company and the individual defendants are defending themselves against these claims. 
 
 Other Legal and Regulatory Proceedings 
 
 The Company is also a party to other legal proceedings and is subject to government investigations, inquiries and audits, and has received and is cooperating with the government in response to CIDs, subpoenas, or similar process from various governmental agencies requesting information. These other legal proceedings and government actions include claims of or relating to bad faith, medical or professional malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, claims processing, dispensing of medications, the use of medical testing devices in the in-home evaluation setting, non-compliance with state and federal regulatory regimes, marketing misconduct, denial of or failure to timely or appropriately pay or administer claims and benefits, provider network structure (including the use of performance-based networks and termination of provider contracts), rescission of insurance coverage, improper disclosure or use of personal information, anticompetitive practices, the Company s participation in the 340B program, general contractual matters, product liability, intellectual property litigation, discrimination and employment litigation. Some of these other legal proceedings are or are purported to be class actions or derivative claims. The Company is defending itself against the claims brought in these matters. 
 
 Awards to the Company and others of certain government contracts, particularly Medicaid contracts and other contracts with government customers in the Company s Health Care Benefits segment, frequently are subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders. These protests may result in awards to the Company being reversed, delayed, or modified. The loss or delay in implementation of any government contract could adversely affect the Company s operating results. The Company will continue to defend contract awards it receives. 
 
 There also continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities and legislators of, and increased litigation regarding, the Company s and the rest of the health care and related benefits industry s business and reporting practices, including premium rate increases, utilization management, development and application of medical policies, complaint, grievance and appeal processing, information privacy, provider network structure (including provider network adequacy, the use of performance-based networks and termination of provider contracts), provider directory accuracy, calculation of minimum medical loss ratios and/or payment of related rebates, delegated arrangements, rescission of insurance coverage, limited benefit health products, student health products, pharmacy benefit management practices (including manufacturers rebates, pricing, the use of narrow networks and the placement of drugs in formulary tiers), sales practices, customer service practices, vendor oversight, and claim payment practices (including payments to out-of-network providers). 
 
 As a leading national health solutions company, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above. These government actions may prevent or delay the Company from implementing planned premium rate increases and may result, and have resulted, in restrictions on the Company s businesses, changes to or clarifications of the Company s business practices, retroactive adjustments to premiums, refunds or other payments to members, beneficiaries, states or the federal government, withholding of premium payments to the Company by government agencies, assessments of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs.

The Company s segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM evaluates the segments operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company s segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company s segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed. 
 
 Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company s business nor reflect the Company s underlying business performance. See the reconciliations of consolidated operating income (GAAP measure) to consolidated adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the CODM s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.

 _____________________________________________ 
 (1) The Company s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company s insurance products, the services performed for the Company s customers or the sale of the Company s products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company s and investors ability to compare the Company s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. 
 (2) The Company s net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of insurance liabilities. Net realized capital gains and losses are reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations in net investment income (loss) within each segment. These capital gains and losses are the result of investment decisions, market conditions and other economic developments that are unrelated to the performance of the Company s business, and the amount and timing of these capital gains and losses do not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company s insurance products, the services performed for the Company s customers or the sale of the Company s products or services. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding net realized capital gains and losses enhances the Company s and investors ability to compare the Company s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. 
 (3) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the acquisition-related integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs are reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment. 
 (4) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the restructuring charges are primarily comprised of a store impairment charge, corporate workforce optimization costs, including severance and employee-related costs, and other asset impairment and related charges associated with the discontinuation of certain non-core assets. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and reduce costs. In connection with this restructuring plan, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and determined that it plans to close retail stores in 2025, and, accordingly, it recorded a store impairment charge to write down the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company also conducted a review of its various strategic assets and determined that it would discontinue the use of certain non-core assets, at which time impairment losses were recorded to write down the carrying value of these assets to the Company s best estimate of their fair value. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the restructuring charges are primarily comprised of a stock-based compensation charge. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the restructuring charges also include severance and employee-related costs and asset impairment charges. The restructuring charges associated with the store impairments are reflected within the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment, other asset impairments and related charges are reflected within the Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segments and corporate workforce optimization costs, including severance and employee-related costs, are reflected within the Corporate/Other segment. 
 (5) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company s continuous evaluation of corporate office real estate space in response to its ongoing flexible work arrangement. The office real estate optimization charges are reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. 
 (6) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the opioid litigation charge relates to a change in the Company s accrual related to ongoing opioid litigation matters. 
 (7) During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the loss on assets held for sale relates to the LTC reporting unit within the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment. During 2022, the Company determined that its LTC business was no longer a strategic asset and committed to a plan to sell it, at which time the LTC business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and its net assets were accounted for as assets held for sale. During the first quarter of 2023, a loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the LTC business to the Company s best estimate of the ultimate selling price which reflected its estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of the third quarter of 2023, the Company determined the LTC business no

 Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of CVS Health Corporation (the Company) as of September 30, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related condensed consolidated statements of shareholders equity for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, June 30, 2024 and 2023 and September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the condensed consolidated interim financial statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 7, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it was derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Commentary - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues increased 5.7 billion, or 6.3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by growth in the Health Care Benefits and Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segments, partially offset by a decline in the Health Services segment. 
 Please see Segment Analysis later in this report for additional information about the revenues of the Company s segments. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses increased 681 million, or 6.9 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the accelerated recognition of unamortized acquisition costs of 394 million in connection with premium deficiency reserves recorded during the third quarter of 2024, as well as increased operating expenses to support growth in the business. 
 50 

Please see Segment Analysis later in this report for additional information about the operating expenses of the Company s segments. 
 
 Operating income 
 Operating income decreased 2.9 billion, or 77.5 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decline in the Health Care Benefits segment, driven by increased utilization and premium deficiency reserves of approximately 1.1 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2024, as well as restructuring charges of approximately 1.2 billion recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2024. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating income in the Health Services segment, primarily driven by improved purchasing economics. 
 Please see Segment Analysis later in this report for additional information about the operating results of the Company s segments. 
 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased 59 million, or 8.5 , due to higher debt in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by long-term debt issued in May 2024. See Liquidity and Capital Resources later in this report for additional information. 
 
 Income tax provision 
 The effective income tax rate was 32.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower pre-tax income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. 
 
 Commentary - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues increased 11.1 billion, or 4.2 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year driven by growth in the Health Care Benefits and Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segments, partially offset by a decline in the Health Services segment. 
 Please see Segment Analysis later in this report for additional information about the revenues of the Company s segments. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses increased 1.9 billion, or 6.3 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased operating expenses to support growth in the business, the accelerated recognition of unamortized acquisition costs in connection with premium deficiency reserves recorded during the third quarter of 2024, as well as operating expenses associated with Oak Street Health which was acquired in May of 2023, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
 Please see Segment Analysis later in this report for additional information about the operating expenses of the Company s segments. 
 
 Operating income 
 Operating income decreased 4.2 billion, or 40.7 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by a decline in the Health Care Benefits segment, driven by increased utilization in the Medicare and Medicaid product lines and premium deficiency reserves of approximately 1.1 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2024, as well as an increase in restructuring charges compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by the absence of a 349 million loss on assets held for sale related to the write-down of the Company s Omnicare long-term care business recorded in the prior year. 
 Please see Segment Analysis later in this report for additional information about the operating results of the Company s segments. 
 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased 232 million, or 11.8 , due to higher debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by long-term debt issued in February and June of 2023 to fund the Company s acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health, respectively, as well as long-term debt issued in May 2024. See Liquidity and Capital Resources later in this report for additional information. 
 
 51 

Income tax provision 
 The effective income tax rate was 26.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower pre-tax income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year.

2024 Outlook 
 
 The Company believes you should consider the following key business and regulatory trends and uncertainties: 
 
 Key Business Trends and Uncertainties 
 
 Membership enrollment in Medicare Advantage and individual exchange plans has exceeded expectations. 
 Utilization, particularly in Medicare Advantage programs, persisted at elevated levels through the third quarter of 2024. Although the level of Medicare utilization is difficult to accurately predict, at this time, the Company expects that continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment and its health care delivery assets in its Health Services segment for the remainder of the year. Further, continued elevated utilization may also result in the Company having to record additional premium deficiency reserves in the Health Care Benefits segment during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 The Company s Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. While the Company continues to work closely with its state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in its premium rates going forward, it is uncertain when these pressures will be fully offset by state rate updates. 
 The Company s individual exchange business is subject to a risk adjustment program whereby the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable or payable based on the risk of its qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets. Changes in the Company s risk relative to the markets risk could adversely impact the Company s estimate of its risk adjustment receivable or payable. 
 The Company expects growth in its new Cordavis, Oak Street Health and Signify Health businesses. 
 The Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company s ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network differential or spread. The Company expects these trends to continue. 
 Glucagon-like peptide 1 GLP-1 supply disruptions, and the associated impact on product mix, could pressure the Company s ability to deliver savings to clients and could impact the Company s results. 
 Consumer spend management and a decline in consumer discretionary spending, as well as a shift to value, grocery and digital retailers, could drive lower front store sales. 
 Future costs are influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. We evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the markets we serve, considering all relevant factors. 
 The Company expects benefits from ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the Company s operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and reduce costs. Refer to Note 2 Restructuring Program for actions implemented under the plan. 
 Changes in conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect interest rates and capital market conditions which could result in increased financing costs. 
 Actions taken by ratings agencies, including changes in the Company s debt ratings, could impact the Company s future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs. 
 
 Key Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties 
 
 The Company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms. 
 Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. This legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect the Company s ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms and the Company s ability to standardize its PBM products and services across state lines.

For additional information regarding these and other trends and uncertainties, see Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part I, Item 1 Business - Government Regulation included in the 2023 Form 10-K.

Segment Analysis 
 
 The following discussion of segment operating results is presented based on the Company s reportable segments in accordance with the accounting guidance for segment reporting and is consistent with the segment disclosure in Note 13 Segment Reporting to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Company has three operating segments, Health Care Benefits, Health Services and Pharmacy Consumer Wellness, as well as a Corporate/Other segment. The Company s segments maintain separate financial information, and the Company s chief operating decision maker CODM evaluates the segments operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company s segments based on adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income (loss) as measured by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company s business nor reflect the Company s underlying business performance. See the reconciliations of operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income (loss) below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the CODM s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.

(1) The Company s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company s insurance products, the services performed for the Company s customers or the sale of the Company s products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company s and investors ability to compare the Company s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. 
 (2) The Company s net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of insurance liabilities. Net realized capital gains and losses are reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations in net investment income (loss) within each segment. These capital gains and losses are the result of investment decisions, market conditions and other economic developments that are unrelated to the performance of the Company s business, and the amount and timing of these capital gains and losses do not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company s insurance products, the services performed for the Company s customers or the sale of the Company s products or services. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding net realized capital gains and losses enhances the Company s and investors ability to compare the Company s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. 
 (3) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the acquisition-related integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs are reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment. 
 (4) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the restructuring charges are primarily comprised of a store impairment charge, corporate workforce optimization costs, including severance and employee-related costs, and other asset impairment and related charges associated with the discontinuation of certain non-core assets. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and reduce costs. In connection with this restructuring plan, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and determined that it plans to close 271 retail stores in 2025, and, accordingly, it recorded a store impairment charge to write down the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company also conducted a review of its various strategic assets and determined that it would discontinue the use of certain non-core assets, at which time impairment losses were recorded to write down the carrying value of these assets to the Company s best estimate of their fair value. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the restructuring charges are primarily comprised of a stock-based compensation charge. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the restructuring charges also include severance and employee-related costs and asset impairment charges. The restructuring charges associated with the store impairments are reflected within the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment, other asset impairments and related charges are reflected within the Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segments and corporate workforce optimization costs, including severance and employee-related costs, are reflected within the Corporate/Other segment. 
 (5) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company s continuous evaluation of corporate office real estate space in response to its ongoing flexible work arrangement. The office real estate optimization charges are reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. 
 (6) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the opioid litigation charge relates to a change in the Company s accrual related to ongoing opioid litigation matters. 
 (7) During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the loss on assets held for sale relates to the LTC reporting unit within the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment. During 2022, the Company determined that its LTC business was no longer a strategic asset and committed to a plan to sell it, at which time the LTC business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and its net assets were accounted for as assets held for sale. During the first quarter of 2023, a loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the LTC business to the Company s best estimate of the ultimate selling price which reflected its estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of the third quarter of 2023, the Company determined the LTC business no longer met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and accordingly the net assets associated with the LTC business were reclassified to held and used at their respective fair values.

 (1) See Segment Analysis above in this report for a reconciliation of Health Care Benefits segment operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income, which represents the Company s principal measure of segment performance. 
 
 Commentary - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues increased 6.7 billion, or 25.5 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year driven by growth in the Medicare and Commercial product lines. 
 
 Premium Deficiency Reserves 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded premium deficiency reserves of approximately 1.1 billion, primarily in its Medicare and individual exchange product lines related to anticipated losses for the 2024 coverage year. The 1.1 billion premium deficiency recorded was comprised of 394 million of operating expenses related to the write-off of unamortized acquisition costs and 670 million of health care costs. 
 
 Medical Benefit Ratio MBR 
 Medical benefit ratio is calculated by dividing the Health Care Benefits segment s health care costs by premium revenues and represents the percentage of premium revenues spent on medical benefits for the segment s Insured members. Management uses MBR to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products, understand variances between actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. MBR provides management and investors with information useful in assessing the operating results of the Health Care Benefits segment s Insured products. 
 The MBR increased to 95.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 85.7 in the prior year driven by increased utilization, 670 million (220 basis points) of premium deficiency reserves recorded as health care costs in the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to anticipated losses in the fourth quarter of 2024 within the Medicare and individual exchange product lines, higher acuity in Medicaid and the unfavorable impact of the previously disclosed decline in the Company s Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year. 
 58 

Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses. 
 Operating expenses increased 715 million, or 17.6 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the accelerated recognition of unamortized acquisition costs of 394 million in connection with the premium deficiency reserves recorded in the third quarter of 2024 and increased operating expenses to support growth across the business. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 14.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.5 in the prior year, reflecting improved fixed cost leverage across the business due to membership growth, partially offset by the 120 basis points impact of the 394 million of accelerated unamortized acquisition costs described above. 
 
 Adjusted operating income (loss) 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Health Care Benefits segment had an adjusted operating loss of 924 million compared to adjusted operating income of 1.5 billion in the prior year. The change was primarily driven by increased utilization, approximately 1.1 billion of premium deficiency reserves recorded in the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to anticipated losses in the fourth quarter of 2024 within the Medicare and individual exchange product lines, the impact of higher acuity in Medicaid following the resumption of redeterminations and the unfavorable impact of the Company s Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net investment income. 
 
 Commentary - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues increased 18.8 billion, or 23.8 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year driven by growth in the Medicare and Commercial product lines. 
 
 Premium Deficiency Reserves 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded premium deficiency reserves of approximately 1.1 billion as described above. 
 
 Medical Benefit Ratio 
 The MBR increased to 91.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 85.5 in the prior year driven by increased utilization and the unfavorable impact of the Company s Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year within the Medicare product line, higher acuity in Medicaid following the resumption of redeterminations, as well as the premium deficiency reserves recorded as health care costs in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses increased 1.7 billion, or 14.0 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased operating expenses to support the growth across the business and the accelerated recognition of unamortized acquisition costs in connection with the premium deficiency reserves recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 13.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.1 in the prior year, reflecting improved fixed cost leverage across the business due to membership growth, partially offset by the 40 basis points impact of the 394 million of accelerated unamortized acquisition costs described above. 
 
 Adjusted operating income 
 Adjusted operating income decreased 4.2 billion, or 84.8 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased utilization and the unfavorable impact of the Company s Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year within the Medicare product line, the premium deficiency reserves recorded in the third quarter of 2024, as well as the higher acuity in Medicaid. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net investment income and improved fixed cost leverage across the business due to membership growth.

 Medical Membership 
 Medical membership represents the number of members covered by the Health Care Benefits segment s Insured and ASC medical products and related services at a specified point in time. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual medical membership and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of medical membership on the Health Care Benefits segment s total revenues and operating results. 
 Medical membership as of September 30, 2024 of 27.1 million increased 178,000 members compared with June 30, 2024, reflecting increases in the Commercial and Medicare product lines. 
 Medical membership as of September 30, 2024 of 27.1 million increased 1.4 million members compared with September 30, 2023, reflecting increases in the Medicare and Commercial product lines. 
 
 Medicare Update 
 On April 1, 2024, CMS issued its final notice detailing final 2025 Medicare Advantage payment rates. Final 2025 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an expected average decrease in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 0.16 , excluding the CMS estimate of Medicare Advantage risk score trend. 
 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan s reimbursement to the plan s star ratings. Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company s 2025 star ratings in October 2024. The Company s 2025 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company s Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2026. Based on the Company s membership as of September 2024, 88 of the Company s Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2025 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 87 of the Company s Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2024 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company s membership as of September 2023.

 (1) See Segment Analysis above in this report for a reconciliation of Health Services segment operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income, which represents the Company s principal measure of segment performance. 
 (2) Pharmacy network revenues relate to claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including the Company s retail pharmacies and LTC pharmacies, as well as activity associated with Maintenance Choice, which permits eligible client plan members to fill their maintenance prescriptions through mail order delivery or at a CVS pharmacy retail store for the same price as mail order. 
 (3) Mail specialty revenues relate to specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect claims picked up at a retail pharmacy, as well as mail order and specialty claims fulfilled by the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment. 
 (4) Includes an adjustment to convert 90-day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription. 
 
 Commentary - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues decreased 2.8 billion, or 5.9 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. These decreases were partially offset by pharmacy drug mix, increased contributions from the Company s health care delivery assets and growth in specialty pharmacy. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses in the Health Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; and depreciation and amortization expense. 
 Operating expenses decreased 57 million, or 7.0 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.7 in both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 61 

Adjusted operating income 
 Adjusted operating income increased 326 million, or 17.4 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by improved purchasing economics, partially offset by continued pharmacy client price improvements and the previously announced loss of a large client. 
 As you review the Health Services segment s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business: 
 The Company s efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, the Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company s ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network differential or spread, and the Company expects these trends to continue. The differential or spread is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider. 
 
 Pharmacy claims processed 
 Pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through the Company s pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either its retail network pharmacies or the Company s mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results. 
 Pharmacy claims processed decreased 16.5 on a 30-day equivalent basis in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year, reflecting the previously announced loss of a large client. 
 
 Generic dispensing rate 
 Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Health Services segment s generic drug claims processed by its total claims processed. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results. 
 The Health Services segment s generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 87.5 in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in GLP-1 pharmacy claims in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. 
 
 Commentary - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues decreased 11.1 billion, or 8.1 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. These decreases were partially offset by pharmacy drug mix, increased contributions from the Company s health care delivery assets, including the acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health, as well as growth in specialty pharmacy. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses increased 300 million, or 14.0 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to operating expenses associated with Oak Street Health, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
 
 Adjusted operating income 
 Adjusted operating income increased slightly in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by improved purchasing economics, largely offset by continued pharmacy client price improvements and the previously announced loss of a large client. 
 
 Pharmacy claims processed 
 The Company s pharmacy claims processed decreased 18.7 on a 30-day equivalent basis in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year, reflecting the previously announced loss of a large client. 
 
 62 

Generic dispensing rate 
 The Health Services segment s generic dispensing rate decreased to 87.8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 88.1 in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in GLP-1 pharmacy claims in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year.

Same store metrics exclude revenues and prescriptions from LTC and infusion services operations. Management uses these metrics to evaluate the performance of existing stores on a comparable basis and to inform future decisions regarding existing stores and new locations. Same-store metrics provide management and investors with information useful in understanding the portion of current revenues and prescriptions resulting from organic growth in existing locations versus the portion resulting from opening new stores. 
 
 Commentary - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues increased 3.6 billion, or 12.3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccines, and pharmacy drug

mix. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, the impact of recent generic introductions and decreased front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count. 
 Pharmacy same store sales increased 19.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the 9.1 increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccines, and pharmacy drug mix. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions. 
 Front store same store sales decreased 1.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to general softening of consumer demand compared to the prior year. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment s stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses. 
 Operating expenses increased 107 million, or 2.3 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2023, as well as increased investments in the segment s operations and capabilities. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the decrease in store count. 
 
 Restructuring charges 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company s restructuring program. See Note 2 Restructuring Program to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Adjusted operating income 
 Adjusted operating income increased 207 million, or 14.9 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As you review the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business: 
 The segment s adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected. 
 
 Prescriptions filled 
 Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment s retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results. 
 Prescriptions filled increased 6.0 on a 30-day equivalent basis in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased utilization. 
 
 Generic dispensing rate 
 Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment s generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results. 
 The Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment s generic dispensing rate remained relatively consistent at 88.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 88.3 in the prior year.

Commentary - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues increased 5.4 billion, or 6.3 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as pharmacy drug mix. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, the impact of recent generic introductions and decreased front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter OTC test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023. 
 Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the 7.1 increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccines, and pharmacy drug mix. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions. 
 Front store same store sales decreased 2.5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The impact of the decrease in store count was largely offset by the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements described above and increased investments in the segment s operations and capabilities. 
 
 Restructuring charges 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company s restructuring program. See Note 2 Restructuring Program to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 Loss on assets held for sale 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a 349 million loss on assets held for sale related to the write-down of its LTC business. 
 
 Adjusted operating income 
 Adjusted operating income increased 80 million, or 2.0 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits. 
 
 Prescriptions filled 
 Prescriptions filled increased 4.3 on a 30-day equivalent basis in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased utilization. 
 
 Generic dispensing rate 
 The Pharmacy Consumer Wellness segment s generic dispensing rate increased to 89.5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 89.1 in the prior year. The increase in the segment s generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by the impact of new generic drug introductions and the Company s ongoing efforts to encourage plan members to use generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The Company maintains a level of liquidity sufficient to allow it to meet its cash needs in the short-term. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain its financial condition and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. The Company continuously assesses its regulatory capital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturity schedule, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. The Company believes its operating cash flows, commercial paper program, credit facilities, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 6.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 1.2 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonrestricted subsidiaries. 
 
 The net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change In millions, except percentages 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 7,247 16,062 (8,815) (54.9) Net cash used in investing activities (7,066) (19,647) 12,581 64.0 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 (1,566) 3,655 (5,221) (142.8) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (1,385) 70 (1,455) (2,078.6) 
 
 Commentary 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 8.8 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the early receipt of the October 2023 CMS payment of 5.2 billion in the prior year and the impact of Medicare utilization, partially offset by the timing of cash receipts and payments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 12.6 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to the acquisitions of Oak Street Health in May 2023 and Signify Health in March 2023, partially offset by higher net purchases of investments. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 1.6 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 3.7 billion in the prior year. The change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of approximately 10.9 billion of long-term senior notes in the prior year, as well as higher share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of 5.0 billion of long-term senior notes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Short-term Borrowings 
 
 Commercial Paper and Back-up Credit Facilities 
 The Company had 800 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 5.00 as of September 30, 2024. In connection with its commercial paper program, the Company maintains a 2.5 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 11, 2027, a 2.5 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 16, 2028, and a 2.5 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 16, 2029. The credit facilities allow for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company s public debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately 0.03 , regardless of usage. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under any of the Company s back-up credit facilities. 
 
 Term Loan Credit Agreement 
 On March 25, 2024, the Company entered into a 364-day 3.0 billion term loan credit agreement. The term loan credit agreement allowed for borrowings at various rates that were dependent, in part, on the Company s public debt ratings. On May 9, 2024, following the issuance of the 5.0 billion in senior notes described under Long-term Borrowings below, the term loan credit agreement terminated. There were no borrowings under the term loan credit agreement through the date of termination.

Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston 
 A subsidiary of the Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the FHLBB ). As a member, the subsidiary has the ability to obtain cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. The maximum borrowing capacity available from the FHLBB as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 1.1 billion. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding advances from the FHLBB. 
 
 Long-term Borrowings 
 
 2024 Notes 
 On May 9, 2024, the Company issued 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.4 senior notes due June 2029, 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.55 senior notes due June 2031, 1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.7 senior notes due June 2034, 750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0 senior notes due June 2044 and 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.05 senior notes due June 2054 for total proceeds of approximately 5.0 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The net proceeds of these offerings were used for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 
 The Company s back-up revolving credit facilities, term loan agreement and unsecured senior notes contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. These covenants do not include an acceleration of the Company s debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in the Company s credit ratings. The Company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect its financial or operating flexibility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. 
 
 Debt Ratings 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s long-term debt was rated Baa2 by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. Moody s and BBB by Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC S P ), and its commercial paper program was rated P-2 by Moody s and A-2 by S P. In August 2024, Moody s and S P changed their outlook on the Company s long-term debt from Stable to Negative. Subsequently, in October 2024, Moody s placed the Company s commercial paper program and long-term debt ratings on review for downgrade. In assessing the Company s credit strength, the Company believes that both Moody s and S P considered, among other things, the Company s capital structure and financial policies, as well as its consolidated balance sheet, its historical acquisition activity and other financial information, including the Company s expectations for full year earnings and cash flows. Although the Company currently believes its long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, it cannot predict the future actions of Moody s and/or S P. The Company s debt ratings have a direct impact on its future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs. 
 
 Share Repurchase Programs 
 
 The following share repurchase programs have been authorized by CVS Health Corporation s Board of Directors (the Board ): 
 In billions 
 Authorization Date 
 Authorized Remaining as of 
 September 30, 2024 
 November 17, 2022 2022 Repurchase Program 10.0 10.0 December 9, 2021 2021 Repurchase Program 10.0 1.5 
 
 Each of the share Repurchase Programs was effective immediately and permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ASR transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. Both the 2022 and 2021 Repurchase Programs can be modified or terminated by the Board at any time. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 39.7 million shares of common stock for approximately 3.0 billion and an aggregate of 22.8 million shares of common stock for approximately 2.0 billion, respectively, both pursuant to the 2021 Repurchase Program. This activity includes the share repurchases under the ASR transactions described below. 
 
 Pursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a 3.0 billion fixed dollar ASR with Morgan Stanley Co. LLC. Upon payment of the 3.0 billion purchase price on January 4, 2024, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation s common stock equal to 85 of the 3.0 billion notional amount of the ASR or 
 69 

approximately 31.4 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2024. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for 2.6 billion and a forward contract for 0.4 billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In March 2024, the Company received approximately 8.3 million shares of CVS Health Corporation s common stock, representing the remaining 15 of the 3.0 billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in March 2024. 
 
 Pursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a 2.0 billion fixed dollar ASR with Citibank, N.A. Upon payment of the 2.0 billion purchase price on January 4, 2023, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation s common stock equal to 80 of the 2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 17.4 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2023. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for 1.6 billion and a forward contract for 0.4 billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In February 2023, the Company received approximately 5.4 million shares of CVS Health Corporation s common stock, representing the remaining 20 of the 2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in February 2023. 
 
 At the time they were received, the initial and final receipt of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The Company prepares the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered by management support the preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of the impairment test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. During 2024, the Government reporting unit within the Health Care Benefits segment has experienced continued elevated utilization pressure in Medicare and higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations in Medicaid, which have resulted in higher medical benefit ratios and lower gross margins than those originally estimated when the prior year annual goodwill impairment test was performed. In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company established premium deficiency reserves of 766 million and 28 million, related to its Medicare and Medicaid product lines, respectively, as further described in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Upon assessment of the impact of these factors on the Company s year-to-date 2024 results and its expectations for the full year, the Company determined there were indicators that the Government reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired, and accordingly, performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2024. The results of the impairment test showed that the fair value of the Government reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 , therefore there was no impairment of goodwill as of the interim testing date. 
 
 The fair value of the Company s reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the Company considers each reporting unit s historical results and current operating trends; consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts; and industry trends. The Company s estimates can be affected by a number of factors, including general economic and regulatory conditions; the risk-free interest rate environment; the Company s market capitalization; efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs, including their prescription drug costs, and/or 
 70 

increase member co-payments; the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share, consumer spending patterns and the Company s ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and execute on its cost reduction initiatives. 
 
 Although the Company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the Government reporting unit in the third quarter of 2024 were reasonable and achievable, continued utilization pressure within the Medicare product line and continued higher acuity in Medicaid may affect the Company s ability to increase operating income in the Government reporting unit at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed. Some of the key assumptions included in the Company s financial projections to determine the estimated fair value of its Government reporting unit include utilization levels, changes in medical membership, revenue growth rates, operating margins and operating expense savings, including the Company s ability to extract cost savings from labor productivity and other initiatives. The estimated fair value of the Government reporting unit is also dependent on earnings multiples of market participants in the health insurance industry, as well as the risk-free interest rate environment which impacts the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow method. As of September 30, 2024, the goodwill balance in the Government reporting unit was approximately 21.2 billion.
