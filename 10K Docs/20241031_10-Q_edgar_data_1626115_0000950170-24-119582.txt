PJT Partners Inc. was formed in connection with certain merger and spin-off transactions whereby the financial and strategic advisory services, restructuring and reorganization advisory services and Park Hill Group businesses of Blackstone Inc. Blackstone or our former Parent were combined with PJT Capital LP, a financial advisory firm founded by Paul J. Taubman in 2013 (together with its then affiliates, PJT Capital ), and the combined business was distributed to Blackstone s unitholders to create PJT Partners Inc., a stand-alone, independent publicly traded company. Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to this transaction as the spin-off. PJT Partners Inc. is a holding company and its only material asset is its controlling equity interest in PJT Partners Holdings LP, a holding partnership that holds the Company s operating subsidiaries, and certain cash and cash equivalents it may hold from time to time. As the sole general partner of PJT Partners Holdings LP, PJT Partners Inc. operates and controls all of the business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of PJT Partners Holdings LP and its operating subsidiaries. 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context requires otherwise, the words PJT Partners Inc. refers to PJT Partners Inc., and PJT Partners, the Company, we, us and our refer to PJT Partners Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including PJT Partners Holdings LP and its operating subsidiaries. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain material presented herein contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include certain information concerning future results of operations, business strategies, acquisitions, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, opportunity, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, continue, may, might, should, could or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. 
 Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict, many of which are outside our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance upon any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: (a) changes in governmental regulations and policies; (b) cyber attacks, security vulnerabilities and internet disruptions, including breaches of data security and privacy leaks, data loss and business interruptions; (c) failures of our computer systems or communication systems, including as a result of a catastrophic event and the use of remote work environments and virtual platforms; (d) the impact of catastrophic events, including business disruptions, pandemics, reductions in employment and an increase in business failures on (1) the U.S. and the global economy and (2) our employees and our ability to provide services to our clients and respond to their needs; (e) the failure of third-party service providers to perform their functions; and (f) volatility in the political and economic environment, including as a result of inflation, elevated interest rates and geopolitical and military conflicts. 
 2 

Any of these factors, as well as such other factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), as such factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. Any such risks could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements.

 million, which aggregate commitments may be increased, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Renewal Agreement, to up to million during the period beginning December 1 each year through March 1 of the following year. On July 29, 2024, PJT Partners Holdings LP, as borrower, entered into a new syndicated revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement and related documents with Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ), and certain other financial institutions party thereto as lenders. The Credit Agreement, which replaced the Borrower's then-existing Amended and Restated Loan Agreement in its entirety, provides for a revolving credit facility with aggregate principal amount of up to million. Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest of Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus per annum. In connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower paid certain closing costs and fees. In addition, the Borrower will also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility of per annum, payable in arrears. The revolving credit facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate on July 29, 2026, subject to extension by agreement of the Borrower and Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants that among other things, limits or restricts the ability of the Borrower (subject to certain qualifications and exceptions) to make certain payments and enter into certain transactions. The Borrower is required to comply with the following financial covenants (in each case, as defined in the Credit Agreement): Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of million; and 

 Maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of to 1.00

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with PJT Partners Inc. s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our Business 
 PJT Partners is a premier, global, advisory-focused investment bank that was built from the ground up to be different. Our highly experienced, collaborative teams provide independent advice coupled with old-world, high-touch client service. This ethos has allowed us to attract some of the very best talent in the markets in which we operate. We deliver leading advice to many of the world's most consequential companies, effect some of the most transformative transactions and restructurings and raise billions of dollars of capital around the globe to support startups and more established companies. 
 For further information regarding our business, refer to Part I. Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Business Environment 
 Economic and global financial conditions can materially affect our operational and financial performance. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of some of the factors that can affect our performance. 
 Mergers and acquisitions M A is a cyclical business that is impacted by macroeconomic conditions. There are several factors influencing global M A activity in the intermediate term, including monetary policy, greater economic and geopolitical uncertainty and global growth. Worldwide M A announced volumes during the first nine months of 2024 were up 16 compared with the first nine months of 2023. On an annualized basis, volume was up 7 compared with 2023. 1 How these macroeconomic factors will impact the strength of strategic activity in the intermediate term is still uncertain. While we expect the markets to recover to historical relationships between M A activity and broader market benchmarks, the pace of such recovery remains unclear. 
 Global restructuring and special situations activity continued to remain strong throughout the third quarter of 2024 due to continued elevated levels of liability management and more traditional balance sheet restructurings. A number of factors continue to drive activity, including companies proactively managing debt maturities and structural issues facing many industries. Activity in the third quarter was dispersed across companies, creditors and financial sponsors as well as a broad cross section of industries and geographies, demonstrating a continued multi-year trend of elevated activity. 
 Fund placement activity, although increased from a year ago levels, remained challenged given the global macroeconomic environment and supply of alternative investment opportunities in the market seeking capital. Additionally, limited partners have become more discerning in their deployment of capital for both existing and new fund manager relationships. Investors continue to focus on existing relationships and, as a result, the bar for fund managers to attract new investors remains high as a flight to quality persists. As it relates to private capital solutions, investors need for liquidity continues to be a driver for increased market volumes, and, absent any unexpected macroeconomic headwinds, these favorable conditions should persist.

 Key Financial Measures 
 Revenues 
 Substantially all of our revenues are derived from contracts with clients to provide advisory and placement services. This revenue is primarily a function of the number of active engagements we have, the size and the complexity of each of those engagements and the fees we charge for our services. 
 24 

We provide a range of strategic advisory, shareholder advisory, capital markets advisory and restructuring and special situations services to corporations, financial sponsors, institutional investors and governments around the world. In conjunction with providing restructuring advice, we may also assist with raising various forms of financing, including debt and equity. Our private capital solutions services include providing General Partner solutions and investing solutions to clients seeking portfolio liquidity, unfunded commitment relief and investments in secondary markets. Our fund placement services primarily serve a diverse range of investment strategies, including private equity, alternative credit/hedge funds and real estate. We advise on all aspects of the fundraising process including competitive positioning and market assessment, marketing materials and related documentation including partnership terms and conditions most prevalent in the current environment. We also provide public and private placement fundraising services to our corporate clients and recognize placement and underwriting fees based on the successful completion of the transaction. 
 The amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement and are typically based on retainers, completion of a transaction or a capital raise. Fees earned for services provided to alternative asset managers are typically recognized upon acceptance by a fund of capital or capital commitments (referred to as a closing ), in accordance with terms set forth in individual agreements. For commitment based fees, revenue is recognized over time as commitments are accepted. Fees for such closed-end fund arrangements are generally paid in installments over three or four years and interest is charged to the outstanding balance at an agreed upon rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or an alternate reference rate, plus a market-based margin. For funds with multiple closings, the constraint on variable consideration is lifted upon each closing. For open-end fund structures, placement fees are typically calculated as a percentage of a placed investor s month-end net asset value. Typically, we earn fees for such open-end fund structures over a four year period. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized over time as the constraint over variable consideration is lifted. We may receive non-refundable up-front fees in our contracts with customers, which are recorded as revenues in the period over which services are estimated to be provided. 
 A transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons, including global and/or regional economic conditions, failure of parties to agree upon final terms, to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals, to secure necessary financing or to achieve necessary regulatory approvals. In the case of bankruptcy engagements, fees are subject to approval of the court. 
 Interest Income and Other Interest Income and Other represents interest typically earned on Cash and Cash Equivalents, investments in Treasury securities and outstanding placement fees receivable; foreign exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars; sublease income; and the amount of expense reimbursement invoiced to clients related to out-of-pocket expenses. Interest on placement fees receivable is earned from the time revenue is recognized and is calculated as mutually agreed upon with the receivable counterparty. Interest receivable is included in Accounts Receivable, Net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
 Expenses 
 Compensation and Benefits Compensation and Benefits expense includes salaries, restricted and unrestricted cash awards, benefits, employer taxes and equity-based compensation associated with the grants of equity-based awards to partners and employees. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, the composition of our workforce, business performance, compensation adjustments in relation to market movements, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. The expense associated with our restricted and unrestricted cash award and equity plans can also have a significant impact and may vary from year to year. Certain awards are expensed over the requisite service period for partners and employees who are or will become retirement eligible prior to the stated vesting date. Over time, a greater number of partners and employees may become retirement eligible and the related requisite service period over which the expense is recognized will be shorter than the stated vesting period. 
 We maintain compensation programs, including salaries, annual incentive compensation (that may include components of unrestricted cash, restricted cash and/or equity-based awards) and benefits programs. We manage compensation to estimates of competitive levels based on market conditions and performance. Our level of compensation reflects our plan to maintain competitive compensation levels to retain key personnel and it reflects 
 25 

the impact of newly-hired senior professionals, including related grants of equity awards that are generally valued at their grant date fair value. 
 Increasing the number of high-caliber, experienced senior level employees is critical to our growth efforts and our continued investment in senior talent may also increase compensation and benefits expense. These hires generally do not generate significant revenue in the year they are hired. 
 Non-Compensation Expense Non-Compensation expenses are the other costs typical to operating our business, which generally consist of Occupancy and Related, Travel and Related, Professional Fees, Communications and Information Services, Depreciation and Amortization and Other Expenses. Further information regarding these expenses can be found in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Income Taxes PJT Partners Inc. is a corporation subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes in jurisdictions where it does business. Our businesses generally operate as partnerships for U.S. federal and state purposes and as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions, taxes related to income earned by these entities generally represent obligations of the individual members and partners. 
 The operating entities have generally been subject to New York City Unincorporated Business Tax and to entity-level income taxes imposed by state and local as well as non-U.S. jurisdictions, as applicable. These taxes have been reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 PJT Partners Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income tax on its allocable share of results of operations from the holding partnership (PJT Partners Holdings LP). 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") Pillar Two Model Rules ("Pillar Two") set forth for a global 15 minimum tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction in which we operate. Many such jurisdictions have implemented or are in the process of implementing Pillar Two and it is expected to be applicable for annual periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. We are continuing to assess the impact of Pillar Two and do not expect it to have a material impact on the Company s 2024 condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Non-Controlling Interests 
 PJT Partners Inc. is a holding company and its only material asset is its controlling equity interest in PJT Partners Holdings LP, a holding partnership that holds the Company's operating subsidiaries, and certain cash and cash equivalents it may hold from time to time. As the sole general partner of PJT Partners Holdings LP, PJT Partners Inc. operates and controls all of the business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of PJT Partners Holdings LP and its operating subsidiaries. The portion of net income attributable to the non-controlling interests is presented separately in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Placement Fees were 32.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.8 million compared with 26.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Interest Income and Other was 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.5 million compared with 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Interest Income and Other was principally due to higher interest income. 
 Total Revenues were 1,015.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 191.3 million compared with 824.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Advisory Fees were 879.6 
 27 

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 143.5 million compared with 736.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Expenses 
 Expenses were 276.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 41.1 million compared with 235.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expenses was principally due to increases in Compensation and Benefits, Occupancy and Related, Other Expenses and Travel and Related of 33.3 million, 3.2 million, 3.1 million and 1.1 million, respectively. The increase in Compensation and Benefits was driven by higher revenues compared with prior year. Occupancy and Related increased principally due to the expansion and lease term extension for our New York headquarters in the fourth quarter of 2023 and further expansion of our London office in the third quarter of 2024. Other Expenses increased principally due to legal reserves, market data expense and the acceleration of contributions to our partner charitable giving program. Travel and Related increased due to increased levels of business travel. 
 Expenses were 848.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 149.5 million compared with 698.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in expenses was due to increases in Compensation and Benefits, Occupancy and Related, Other Expenses, Travel and Related and Communications and Information Services of 132.9 million, 7.5 million, 4.1 million, 4.0 million and 2.6 million, respectively. The increase in Compensation and Benefits was driven by higher revenues compared with the prior year. Occupancy and Related increased principally due to the expansion and lease term extension for our New York headquarters in the fourth quarter of 2023 and further expansion of our London office in the third quarter of 2024. Other Expenses increased principally due to increases in bad debt expense and market data expense. Travel and Related increased due to increased levels of business travel. Communications and Information Services increased principally due to investments in technology infrastructure. 
 Provision for Taxes 
 The Company s Provision for Taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.3 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 16.8 on pretax income of 49.4 million. The Company s Provision for Taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 11.4 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 26.8 on pretax income of 42.6 million. 
 The Company s Provision for Taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.2 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 12.1 on pretax income of 167.7 million. The Company s Provision for Taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 25.7 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 20.4 on pretax income of 125.9 million. 
 Non-Controlling Interests 
 Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests is calculated by multiplying the Income Before Provision for Taxes by the percentage allocation of the income between the holders of common units of partnership interest in PJT Partners Holdings LP Partnership Units and holders of Class A common stock of PJT Partners Inc. after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 We regularly monitor our liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents, investments, working capital assets and liabilities, any commitments and other liquidity requirements. 
 28 

Our assets have been historically comprised of cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables arising from advisory and placement engagements and operating lease right-of-use assets. Our liabilities generally include accrued compensation and benefits, accounts payable and accrued expenses, taxes payable and operating lease liabilities. We expect to pay a significant amount of incentive compensation toward the end of each year and during the beginning of the next calendar year with respect to the prior year s results. A portion of annual compensation may be awarded with equity-based compensation and thus requires less cash. We expect levels of cash to decline at the end of the year and during the first quarter of each year after incentive compensation is paid to our employees. We then expect cash to build throughout the remainder of the year. 
 On February 1, 2021, PJT Partners Holdings LP, as borrower (the Borrower ), entered into a Renewal and Modification Agreement (the Renewal Agreement and related documents with First Republic Bank (now part of JPMorgan Chase), as lender (the Lender ), amending the terms of the Borrower s revolving credit facility with the Lender under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated October 1, 2018 (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement ). 
 On July 29, 2024, PJT Partners Holdings LP, as borrower, entered into a new syndicated revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement and related documents with Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ), and certain other financial institutions party thereto as lenders. The Credit Agreement, which replaces the Borrower's existing Amended and Restated Loan Agreement in its entirety, provides for a revolving credit facility with aggregate principal amount of up to 100 million. Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest of Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.85 per annum. In connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower paid certain closing costs and fees. In addition, the Borrower will also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility of 0.25 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. The revolving credit facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate on July 29, 2026, subject to extension by agreement of the Borrower and Administrative Agent. Further information regarding the Credit Agreement can be found in Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments, Line of Credit in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the debt covenants under the Credit Agreement, and as of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the debt covenants under the Renewal Agreement and Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and as of December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Renewal Agreement and Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. 
 We evaluate our cash needs on a regular basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 477.0 million and 436.9 million, respectively. The vast majority of these balances are either held in institutions labeled by the Financial Stability Board as global systemically important banks or Treasury securities. Although we maintain multiple banking relationships with both global and regional banks and actively monitor the financial stability of such institutions, a failure at any institution where we maintain a banking relationship could impact our liquidity. 
 Our liquidity is highly dependent upon cash receipts from clients, which are generally dependent upon the successful completion of transactions as well as the timing of receivable collections. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, was 343.6 million and 263.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was 4.0 million and 2.4 million, respectively. Included in Accounts Receivable, Net are long-term receivables of 88.5 million and 84.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to placement fees that are generally paid in installments over a period of three to four years. 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 Our primary cash needs are for working capital, paying operating expenses including cash compensation to our employees, exchanging of Partnership Units for cash, repurchasing shares of the Company s Class A common stock, paying income taxes, dividend payments, partnership tax distributions, capital expenditures, making payments pursuant to the tax receivable agreement, commitments and strategic investments. We expect to fund these liquidity 
 29 

requirements through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our ability to fund these needs will depend, in part, on our ability to generate or raise cash in the future which depends on our future financial results, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors. 
 Additionally, our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations will be impacted by global economic conditions. If our cash flows from operations are significantly reduced, we may need to borrow from our revolving credit facility, incur debt, or issue additional equity. Although we believe that our revolving credit facility, and our ability to renew it, will permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions for the foreseeable future, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: business performance; our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating; the liquidity of the overall capital markets; the current state of the economy; and stability of our lending institution. We cannot provide any assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all. We believe that our future cash from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility, together with our access to funds on hand, will provide adequate resources to fund our liquidity and capital needs. 
 Regulatory Capital 
 We are subject to regulatory requirements in the U.S. and certain international jurisdictions to ensure general financial soundness and liquidity. This requires, among other things, that we comply with certain minimum capital requirements, recordkeeping, reporting procedures, experience and training requirements for employees and certain other requirements and procedures. These regulatory requirements may restrict the flow of funds to and from affiliates. See Note 14. Regulated Entities in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing for further information. The licenses under which we operate are meant to be appropriate to conduct our business. We actively monitor our regulatory capital and we believe that we provide each of these entities with sufficient capital and liquidity, consistent with their business and regulatory requirements. 
 Our activities may also be subject to regulation, including regulatory capital requirements, by various other foreign jurisdictions and self-regulatory organizations. 
 We do not anticipate that compliance with any and all such requirements will materially adversely impact the availability of funds for domestic and parent-level purposes. 
 Exchange Agreement 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the exchange agreement, as amended, between us and certain of the holders of Partnership Units (other than PJT Partners Inc.), Partnership Units are exchangeable at the option of the holder for cash or, at our election, for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Depending on our liquidity and capital resources, market conditions, the timing and concentration of exchange requests and other considerations, we may choose to fund exchanges of Partnership Units with available cash, borrowings or new issuances of Class A common stock or to settle exchanges by issuing Class A common stock to the exchanging holder of Partnership Units. 
 Certain holders of Partnership Units exchanged 0.4 million and 0.3 million Partnership Units, respectively, for cash in the amounts of 43.4 million and 19.6 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On February 6, 2024, the Company announced that the Board authorized a 500 million Class A common stock repurchase program, which replaced the then-existing 200 million repurchase program authorized on April 25, 2022. Under the new repurchase program, which has no expiration date, shares of the Company s Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, 
 30 

including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1.9 million shares of the Company s Class A common stock at an average price per share of 100.08, or 185.5 million in aggregate, pursuant to the share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining repurchase authorization was 327.2 million. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 For a discussion of our contractual obligations, refer to Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have not been any material changes to our contractual obligations since December 31, 2023. 
 Commitments and Contingencies 
 Litigation 
 With respect to our litigation matters, including any litigation discussed under the caption Legal Proceedings elsewhere in this report, we are not currently able to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support such an assessment, including , but not limited to, quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by courts on motions or appeals, analysis by experts or the status of any settlement negotiations. While the ultimate outcome and the costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that we are not currently party to any material pending proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, the resolution of which would have a material effect on the Company. 
 Guarantee 
 The Company provides a guarantee to a lending institution for certain loans held by employees for investment in funds of its former Parent, which are secured by the underlying investments in those funds. The amount guaranteed was 2.0 million and 2.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In connection with this guarantee, we currently expect any associated risk of loss to be insignificant. 
 Indemnifications 
 We have entered and may continue to enter into contracts that contain a variety of indemnification obligations. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is not known; however, we currently expect any associated risk of loss to be insignificant. In connection with these matters, we have incurred and may continue to incur legal expenses, which are expensed as incurred. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the holders of Partnership Units (other than PJT Partners Inc.) that provides for the payment by PJT Partners Inc. to exchanging holders of Partnership Units of 85 of the benefits, if any, that PJT Partners Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of the increases in tax basis related to such exchanges of Partnership Units and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had amounts due of 30.7 million and 29.7 million, respectively, pursuant to the tax receivable agreement, which represent management s best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed in connection with the tax receivable agreement. Actual payments may differ significantly from estimated amounts due. 
 31 

Further information regarding the tax receivable agreement can be found in Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Other 
 See Notes 8, 10, 11 and 13 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing for further information in connection with income taxes, equity-based and other deferred compensation plans, leasing arrangements and commitments, respectively. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 A discussion of critical accounting estimates is included in Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Recent Accounting Developments 
 Information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial statements can be found in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market Risk and Credit Risk 
 Our business is not capital-intensive and we do not invest in derivative instruments or, generally, borrow. As a result, we are not subject to significant market risk (including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk) or credit risk. Notwithstanding the foregoing, current economic and geopolitical uncertainty and slowing global growth could have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Risks Related to Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments 
 Our cash and cash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments and money market funds that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained in U.S. and non-U.S. bank accounts and are held at six financial institutions. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, we hold investments in Treasury securities, certain of which are classified as Investments in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk based on our diversified use of global and regional financial institutions and the short-term nature of the securities. 
 Credit Risk 
 We estimate our allowance for credit losses using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. We maintain an allowance for credit losses that, in our opinion, reflects current expected credit losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was 4.0 million and 2.4 million, respectively. 
 Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to the risk that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may have an adverse effect on the reported value of our non-U.S. dollar denominated or based assets and liabilities. In addition, the reported amounts of our revenues may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the transaction currency and the U.S. dollar, the currency in which our financial statements are denominated. The principal 
 32 

non-U.S. dollar currencies include the pound sterling, the euro, the Hong Kong dollar and the Japanese yen. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the impact of the fluctuation of foreign currencies in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax Currency Translation Adjustment in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income was a gain of 2.7 million and a loss of 0.5 million, respectively, and in Interest Income and Other in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, a loss of 1.3 million and 3.4 million, respectively. We have not entered into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or other methods. Given the geopolitical uncertainty and the ongoing economic impact, elevated interest rates and heightened inflation, exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could unfavorably affect our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during our most recent quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 33 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, the Company and its affiliates may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. In addition, government agencies and self-regulatory organizations in countries in which we conduct business undertake periodic examinations and may initiate administrative proceedings regarding the Company s and its affiliates business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, or its directors, officers or employees. It is our policy to cooperate fully with such governmental requests, examinations and administrative proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of determining whether any loss in connection with any such matters is probable and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, we cannot estimate the amount of such loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how or if such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. The Company records loss contingencies for matters where the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of a probable loss. Subject to the foregoing, we believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that we are not currently party to any material pending proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, the resolution of which would have a material effect on the Company. 
 Further disclosure regarding legal proceedings is provided in Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies, Litigation in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. Financial Statements of this filing. 
 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 There were no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining repurchase authorization was 327.2 million. Under the repurchase program, shares of the Company s Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.

The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.
