 The significant assumptions used under the income approach, or discounted cash flow method, are projected net sales, projected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), and the cost of capital. Projected net sales and projected EBITDA were determined to be significant assumptions because they are the primary drivers of the projected cash flows in the discounted cash flow fair value model. Cost of capital was also determined to be a significant assumption as it is the discount rate used to calculate the current fair value of those projected cash flows. 
 Although the Company believes the assumptions and estimates made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact its reported financial results. In addition, sustained declines in the Company s stock price and related market capitalization could impact key assumptions in the overall estimated fair values of its reporting units and could result in non-cash impairment charges that could be material to the Company s consolidated balance sheet or results of operations. Should the carrying value of a reporting unit be in excess of the estimated fair value of that reporting unit, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the reporting unit to fair value.

 . While the indefinite-lived trade name was not determined to be impaired, if the indefinite-lived trade name does not perform as projected or if market factors utilized in the impairment analysis deteriorate, including an unfavorable change in the weighted average cost of capital, could materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts could potentially result in a material non-cash impairment charge. 
 Long-lived assets, including intangible assets deemed to have finite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit or material adverse changes in the business climate that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired. When impairment indicators are present, the recoverability of the asset is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of each long-lived asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.

While many of the sales incentives and promotions are contractually agreed upon with the Company s customers, certain of the sales incentives and promotions are non-contractual and require the Company to estimate the amount of variable consideration based on historical experience and other known factors or as the most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes.

Shares of Vasconia s capital stock are traded on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, the Mexican Stock Exchange. The Quotation Key is VASCONI. During the second quarter of 2024, Vasconia s shareholders approved a resolution to a reorganization process in terms of the Law of Commercial Bankruptcy in Mexico and subsequently a bankruptcy suit was filed against Vasconia by one of its largest suppliers. The Company concluded that the recent events constituted a loss of significant influence and resulted in the discontinuation of the equity method of accounting. The Company accounts for its Vasconia investment at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 321: Investments Equity Securities , with any changes in fair value recorded within income (loss) on equity securities on the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the loss of significant influence, the accumulated other comprehensive losses previously recognized under the equity method of accounting were reclassified to the carrying value of the Vasconia investment and subsequently resulted in a non-cash loss of

The percentage applied to the Company s Excess Cash Flow is based on the Company s Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Debt Agreements). When an Excess Cash Flow payment is required, each lender has the option to decline a portion or all of the prepayment amount payable to it. Per the Term Loan, when the Company makes an Excess Cash Flow prepayment, the payment is first applied to satisfy the next eight (8) scheduled future quarterly required payments of the Term Loan in order of maturity and then to the remaining scheduled installments on a pro rata basis.

Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, the Company may have greater borrowing availability during the third and fourth quarters of each year. Consequently, the million commitment thereunder may not represent actual borrowing capacity. The Company s borrowing capacity may be further limited by the Term Loan financial covenant of to 1.00 maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio.

Where the Company deems it prudent, the Company engages in hedging programs using foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings. The Company purchases foreign currency forward contracts with terms less than 18 months to protect against currency exchange risks associated with the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers. The Company does not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into USD, as the Company regards this as an accounting exposure rather than an economic exposure. 
 The aggregate gross notional value of foreign exchange contracts at September 30, 2024 was million. These foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedges in order to apply hedge accounting. 
 The Company is exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the USD and each other, and to changes to the credit risk of derivative counterparties. The Company attempts to minimize these risks primarily by using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits. These hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risk. Factors that could influence the effectiveness of the Company s hedging programs include those impacting currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets. All foreign currency forward contracts that the Company enters into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure. The Company does not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes, and as of September 30, 2024, these foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedges in to order to apply hedge accounting.

 million. In February 2017, the EPA indicated that it planned to expand its field investigation for the RI/FS to a second operable unit OU-2 to determine the nature and extent of the groundwater damage at and from the Site and to determine the nature of the remedial action needed to address the damage. The EPA requested access to the property occupied by WSPR to install monitoring wells and to undertake groundwater sampling as part of this expanded investigation. WSPR consented to the EPA s access request, provided that the EPA received PRIDCO s consent as the property owner. The EPA has also issued notices of potential liability to a number of other entities affiliated with the Site, which used the organic compounds of concern. 
 In December 2018, the Company, WSPR, and other identified potentially responsible parties affiliated with the Site entered into tolling agreements with the U.S. government to extend the statute of limitations for potential claims for the recovery of response costs for the initial operable unit under Section 107 of CERCLA. The tolling agreements have been extended multiple times and currently expire in November 2025. The tolling agreements do not constitute in any way an admission or acknowledgment of any fact, conclusion of law, or liability by the parties to the agreements. 
 The EPA released its proposed plan for OU-2 in July 2019, and on September 30, 2019, the EPA issued the ROD for OU-2. The EPA elected to implement its preferred remedy consisting of in-situ treatment of groundwater and a monitored natural attenuation program including monitoring of the plume fringe at the Site. The EPA s estimated total net present worth cost for its selected remedy for OU-2 is million, and the EPA is currently leading remediation of OU-2. 
 In August 2021, WSPR received a Notice of Liability for the Site from the Department of Justice on behalf of the EPA, and in September 2021, WSPR responded with a good faith offer to conduct additional testing and remedial design work for OU-1. WSPR has actively participated in negotiations among the U.S. Government (the Department of Justice and the EPA) and other potentially responsible parties with respect to the remedial work at OU-1, which negotiations culminated in the finalization of a Consent Decree for Remedial Design and Remedial Action at Operable Unit One of the San German Groundwater Contamination Site Decree ). On July 26, 2023, the U.S. Government filed a complaint in United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico for the purpose of seeking judicial approval of the Decree. As required by applicable regulations, the U.S. Government simultaneously lodged the Decree for public comment. No comments were received during the public comment period. On September 6, 2023, at the conclusion of the public comment period, the U.S. Government filed a Motion

 to cover probable and estimable liabilities with respect to the above remedial design and remedial action for the initial operable unit. However, it is not possible at this time for the Company to estimate its share of its ultimate liability for the Site. In the event of one or more adverse determinations related to this matter, it is possible that the ultimate liability resulting from this matter and the impact on the Company s results of operations could be material. 
 U.S. Customs and Border Protection matter 
 By letter dated August 26, 2019, the Company was advised that U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") had commenced an investigation, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1592, regarding the Company s tariff classification of certain tableware and kitchenware. The issue centers on whether such merchandise meets the criteria for reduced duty rates as specified sets as those terms are defined in Chapter 69, Note 6(b), Harmonized Tariff System of the United States. The period of investigation is stated to be from August 26, 2014 to the present. Since being notified of the investigation, the Company has obtained a significant amount of evidence that, the Company believes, supports that the imported products were properly classified as specified sets. The Company's counsel filed a Lead Protest and Application for Further Review with CBP on February 5, 2020 (the "Lead Protest") relating to a single shipment made during the investigation period. 
 CBP approved the Company s Lead Protest on June 8, 2020 stating that the specified set requirement was fulfilled with respect to the protested shipment based on information provided by the Company. Based on this decision, no additional duties will be owed for the tableware collections imported in this shipment. 
 The Company also compiled and submitted to CBP a complete set of supporting documents for additional protests (for the remaining tableware collections that were imported by the Company under the protested shipments). of the additional protests was approved on October 15, 2020; the other remain pending. If the CBP approves these additional claims and accepts the evidence presented, then no additional duties will be owed for the remaining protested shipments. 
 Because the period of investigation covers a period, the Company is compiling supporting documentation packages for all tableware collections imported during this period. 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the statute of limitations has expired for the collection of nearly all of the duties and penalties related to this matter. At this time, the Company considers any potential losses related to this matter would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. 
 Other 
 The Company is, from time to time, involved in other legal proceedings. The Company believes that other current litigation is routine in nature and incidental to the conduct of the Company s business and that none of this litigation, individually or collectively, would have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 ABOUT THE COMPANY 
 The Company designs, sources and sells branded kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home. The Company s product categories include two categories of products used to prepare, serve, and consume foods: Kitchenware (kitchen tools and gadgets, cutlery, kitchen scales, thermometers, cutting boards, shears, cookware, pantryware, spice racks, and bakeware) and Tableware (dinnerware, stemware, flatware, and giftware); and one category, Home Solutions, which comprises other products used in the home (thermal beverageware, bath scales, weather and outdoor household products, food storage, neoprene travel products and home d cor). 
 The Company markets several product lines within each of its product categories and under most of the Company s brands, primarily targeting moderate price points through virtually every major level of trade. The Company believes it possesses certain competitive advantages based on its brands, its emphasis on innovation and new product development, and its sourcing capabilities. The Company owns or licenses a number of leading brands in its industry, including Farberware , Mikasa , KitchenAid , Taylor , Rabbit , Pfaltzgraff , Built NY , Sabatier , Fred Friends, Kamenstein , S well and Dolly . Historically, the Company s sales growth has come from expanding product offerings within its product categories, developing existing brands, acquiring new brands (including complementary brands in markets outside the United States), and establishing new product categories. Key factors in the Company s growth strategy have been the selective use and management of the Company s brands and the Company s ability to provide a stream of new products and designs. A significant element of this strategy is the Company s in-house design and development teams that create new products, packaging and merchandising concepts. 
 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 The global economy experienced relatively high inflation throughout 2023. As global inflation levels moderate, the impact of elevated inflation and high interest rates have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact consumer spending and buying patterns in 2024. Shifts in consumer spending and buying patterns may directly impact our retailer ordering patterns, which may adversely impact the Company s results. In addition, disruptions in the global supply chain, including the heightened risks of attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea and the potential longshoremen strike in the U.S., have and may continue to adversely impact the Company s results due to supply delays leading to an increase in safety stock levels and an increase in transportation costs. The Company expects continued uncertainty as result of these trends in 2024. 
 
 BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
 The Company has two reportable segments, U.S. and International. The Company has segmented its operations to reflect the manner in which management reviews and evaluates the results of its operations. The U.S. segment includes the Company s primary domestic business that designs, markets and distributes its products to retailers, distributors and directly to consumers through its own websites. The International segment consists of certain business operations conducted outside the U.S.. Management evaluates the performance of the U.S. and International segments based on net sales and income from operations. Such measures give recognition to specifically identifiable operating costs such as cost of sales, distribution expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Certain general and administrative expenses, such as senior executive salaries and benefits, stock compensation, director fees, and accounting, legal fees and consulting fees, are not allocated to the specific segments and are reflected as unallocated corporate expenses. 
 
 EQUITY INVESTMENT 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned 24.7 of the outstanding capital stock of Grupo Vasconia S.A.B. Vasconia ), an integrated manufacturer of aluminum products and a housewares company in Mexico. Shares of Vasconia s capital stock are traded on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, the Mexican Stock Exchange. The Quotation Key is VASCONI. During the second quarter of 2024, Vasconia s shareholders approved a resolution to a reorganization process in terms of the Law of Commercial Bankruptcy in Mexico and subsequently a bankruptcy suit was filed against Vasconia by one of its largest suppliers. The Company concluded that the recent events constituted a loss of significant influence and resulted in the

 discontinuation of the equity method of accounting. The Company accounts for its Vasconia investment at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 321: Investments Equity Securities , with any changes in fair value recorded within income (loss) on equity securities on the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the loss of significant influence, the accumulated other comprehensive losses previously recognized under the equity method of accounting were reclassified to the carrying value of the Vasconia investment and subsequently resulted in a non-cash loss of 14.2 million to reduce the investment to its fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The fair value of the Vasconia investment was not material as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 SEASONALITY 
 The Company s business and working capital needs are seasonal, with a majority of sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters. In 2023 and 2022, net sales for the third and fourth quarters accounted for 57 and 54 of total annual net sales, respectively. In anticipation of the pre-holiday shipping season, inventory levels increase primarily in the June through October time period. 
 Consistent with the seasonality of the Company s net sales and inventory levels, the Company also experiences seasonality in its inventory turnover and turnover days from one quarter to the next. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates discussed in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 7 under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates .

 was attributable to higher depreciation expense due to changes in asset retirement obligation estimates, higher software expenses due to the launch of a new warehouse management system at the Company's west coast distribution center, higher pallet expenses and higher labor rates. These increases were partially offset by lower freight out expenses.

This was partially offset by inflationary increases across several expense categories. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the International segment were 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.7 million for the corresponding period in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 33.1 and 30.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Unallocated corporate expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.3 million, as compared to 4.9 million for the corresponding period in 2023. The current period decrease was driven by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher legal expenses and professional fees. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense was 5.8 million and 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in expense was a result of higher interest rates on outstanding borrowings, partially offset by lower average outstanding borrowings in the current period.

These derivatives were entered into for purposes of locking-in a fixed interest rate on a portion of the Company s variable interest rate debt.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0 primarily due to foreign losses for which no tax benefit is recognized as such amounts are fully offset with a valuation allowance.

 Loss on equity securities 
 Loss on equity securities was 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company lost significant influence over its investment in Vasconia and discontinued the equity method of accounting.

NOTE 4 INVESTMENT for additional information. 
 Income taxes 
 Income tax provision of 1.7 million and 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, represent taxes on both U.S. and foreign earnings at a combined effective income tax provision rate of (8.2) and 197.0 , respectively.

 Equity in losses, net of taxes 
 Equity in losses of Vasconia, net of taxes , was 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The Company s principal sources of cash to fund liquidity needs are: (i) cash provided by operating activities and (ii) borrowings available under its revolving credit facility under the ABL Agreement, as defined below. The Company s primary uses of funds consist of working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, payments of dividends, and payments of principal and interest on its debt. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 6.0 million, compared to 16.2 million at December 31, 2023. Working capital was 230.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 224.4 million at December 31, 2023. Liquidity as of September 30, 2024 was 75.6 million, consisting of 6.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, 51.6 million of availability under the ABL Agreement, limited by the Term Loan financial covenant, and 18.0 million of available funding under the Receivables Purchase Agreement. 
 Inventory, a large component of the Company s working capital, is expected to fluctuate from period to period, with inventory levels higher primarily in the June through October time period. The Company also expects inventory turnover to fluctuate from period to period based on product and customer mix. Certain product categories have lower inventory turnover rates as a result of minimum order quantities from the Company s vendors or customer replenishment needs. Certain other product categories experience higher inventory turns due to lower minimum order quantities or trending sale demands. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, inventory turnover was 2.1 times, or 175 days, as compared to 2.2 times, or 164 days, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Inventory turns have remained relatively consistent. 
 On February 7, 2024, in connection with the Wallace EPA Matter, the Company provided financial assurance of 5.6 million in the form of a letter of credit. This reduced the availability under the revolving credit facility in the period. 
 The Company believes that availability under the revolving credit facility under its ABL Agreement, cash on hand and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund the Company s operations for the next twelve months. However, if circumstances were to adversely change, the Company may seek alternative sources of liquidity including debt and/or equity financing. However, there can be no assurance that any such alternative sources would be available or sufficient. 
 The Company closely monitors the creditworthiness of its customers. Based upon its evaluation of changes in customers creditworthiness, the Company may modify credit limits and/or terms of sale. However, notwithstanding the Company s efforts to monitor its customers financial condition, the Company could be materially adversely affected by future changes in these conditions.

The Term Loan has a principal amount of 150.0 million, and matures on August 26, 2027. 
 The Term Loan requires the Company to make quarterly payments of principal each equal to 1.25 of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan, commencing on March 31, 2024, with the remaining balance payable on the maturity date.

The percentage applied to the Company s Excess Cash Flow is based on the Company s Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Debt Agreements). When an Excess Cash Flow payment is required, each lender has the option to decline a portion or all of the prepayment amount payable to it. Per the Term Loan, when the Company makes an Excess Cash Flow prepayment, the payment is first applied to satisfy the next eight (8) scheduled future quarterly required payments of the Term Loan in order of maturity and then to the remaining scheduled installments on a pro rata basis. 
 The maximum borrowing amount under the ABL Agreement may be increased to up to 250.0 million if certain conditions are met. One or more tranches of additional term loans (the Incremental Term Facilities may be added under the Term Loan if certain conditions are met. The Incremental Facilities may not exceed the sum of (i) 50.0 million plus (ii) an unlimited amount so long as, in the case of (ii) only, the Company s secured net leverage ratio, as defined in and computed on a pro forma basis pursuant to the Term Loan, after giving effect to such increase, is no greater than 3.25 to 1.00, subject to certain limitations and for the period defined pursuant to the Term Loan but not to mature earlier than the maturity date of the then existing term loans.

 Availability under the ABL Agreement is limited to the lesser of the 200.0 million commitment thereunder and the borrowing base and therefore depends on the valuation of certain current assets comprising the borrowing base. The borrowing capacity under the ABL Agreement will depend, in part, on eligible levels of accounts receivable and inventory that fluctuate regularly. Due to the seasonality of the Company s business, the Company may have greater borrowing availability during the third and fourth quarters of each year. Consequently, the 200.0 million commitment thereunder may not represent actual borrowing capacity. The Company s borrowing capacity may be further limited by the Term Loan financial covenant of 5.00 to 1.00 maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio. As of September 30, 2024, the availability under the ABL Agreement, limited by the Term Loan financial covenant, was 51.6 million.

 ABL Agreement provides that during any period (a) commencing on the last day of the most recently ended four consecutive fiscal quarters on or prior to the date availability under the ABL Agreement is less than the greater of 20.0 million and 10 of the aggregate commitment under the ABL Agreement at any time and (b) ending on the day after such availability has exceeded the greater of 20.0 million and 10 of the aggregate commitment under the ABL Agreement for 45 consecutive days, the Company is required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. 
 The Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Debt Agreements at September 30, 2024. 
 On June 8, 2023, the Company completed the repurchase of 47.2 million in principal amount of the Term Loan, for 95 per 100 of principal. The repurchase was executed by way of a reverse Dutch auction, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions provided for in the Term Loan. In connection therewith, debt issuance costs of 0.5 million were written off and fees of 0.4 million were incurred. The gain on the early retirement of the Term Loan of 1.5 million, net of fees and expenses, was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company expects that it will continue to borrow, subject to availability, and repay funds under the ABL Agreement based on working capital and other corporate needs. 
 Covenant Calculations 
 Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure), which is defined in the Company s Debt Agreements, is used in the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Total Leverage Ratio and Total Net Leverage Ratio, which are required to be provided to the Company s lenders pursuant to its Debt Agreements. 
 The Company s adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 was 53.9 million. 
 Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.6 million. 
 Non-GAAP financial measure 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, each promulgated by the SEC. This measure is provided because management of the Company uses this financial measure in evaluating the Company s on-going financial results and trends, and management believes that exclusion of certain items allows for more accurate period-to-period comparison of the Company s operating performance by investors and analysts. Management also uses this non-GAAP information as an indicator of business performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as discussed above, is also one of the measures used to calculate financial covenants required to be provided to the Company s lenders pursuant to its Debt Agreements. 
 Investors should consider this non-GAAP financial measure in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company s financial performance measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, the Company s non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies including other companies within the home retail industry.

The Company will service the Receivables, and as such servicer, collect and otherwise enforce the Receivables on behalf of HSBC. The term of the agreement is for 364 days and shall automatically be extended for annual successive terms unless terminated. Either party may terminate the agreement at any time upon sixty days prior written notice to the other party.

 Foreign Exchange Contracts 
 The Company is party from time to time to certain foreign exchange contracts, primarily to offset the earnings impact related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the USD may positively or negatively affect the Company s revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in USD. Where the Company deems it prudent, the Company engages in hedging programs using foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings. The Company purchases foreign currency forward contracts with terms less than 18 months to protect against currency exchange risks associated with the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers. The Company does not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into USD, as the Company regards this as an accounting exposure rather than an economic exposure. 
 The aggregate gross notional value of foreign exchange contracts at September 30, 2024 was 2.8 million. These foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedges in order to apply hedge accounting. 
 The Company is exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the USD and each other, and to changes to the credit risk of derivative counterparties. The Company attempts to minimize these risks primarily by using foreign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counterparty credit limits. These hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange and credit risk. Factors that could influence the effectiveness of the Company s hedging programs include those impacting currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments and liquidity of the credit markets. All foreign currency forward contracts that the Company enters into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure. The Company does not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes, and as of September 30, 2024, these foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedges in to order to apply hedge accounting. 
 Operating activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 17.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease from 2024 compared to 2023 was attributable to increased use of cash related to inventory purchases and higher net loss, partially offset by timing of collections related to the Company's accounts receivables, and timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 1.6 million and 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 32.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was attributable to the repurchase of a portion of the term loan and stock repurchases in the 2023 period, partially offset by lower net proceeds from revolving credit facility in the 2024 period. 
 Stock repurchase program 
 On March 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board authorized the repurchase of up to 20.0 million of the Company s common stock, replacing the Company s previously-authorized 10.0 million share repurchase program. The repurchase authorization permits the Company to effect the repurchases from time to time through open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions. No repurchases were effected during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining dollar amount available for repurchases under the Board authorized plan was 11.1 million.
