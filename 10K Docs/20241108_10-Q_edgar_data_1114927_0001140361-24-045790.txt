securities, all considered investment grade, which had an aggregate fair value of ,000 and a total unrealized loss of ,000, have been in an
 unrealized loss position for less than twelve months as of September 30, 2024. Three hundred and eighty-one securities, all considered
 investment grade, which had an aggregate fair value of ,000 and a total unrealized loss of ,000, have been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months as of September 30, 2024. The unrealized losses on the Company s
 investment securities were caused by market conditions for these types of investments, particularly changes in risk-free interest rates. The decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and the Company
 does not intend to sell the securities. The Company has concluded it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their anticipated cost basis. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, the
 Company has t recorded an allowance for credit losses on these securities and the unrecognized or unrealized losses on these
 securities have not been recognized into income.

economic variables, forecasted unemployment and gross domestic product, as loss drivers for its allowance for credit losses. The Company moved from California state
 loss drivers to national loss drivers at the beginning of 2024. The reason for the change is a higher credit loss correlation between the national loss driver variables than the state loss driver variables. During the quarter ended
 September 30, 2024, the levels of forecasted national unemployment and forecasted gross domestic product remained relatively stable. The Company recognized a reversal of provision of ,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a substantial payoff of a non-performing commercial loan relationship. Management believes the allowance
 for credit losses at September 30, 2024 appropriately reflected expected credit losses in the loan portfolio at that date.

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION

The assets of the Company set forth in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a 14,707,000, or 9.9 , increase in cash and cash equivalents, a 466,000, or 2.4 , decrease in
 certificates of deposit, a 60,047,000, or 10.5 , increase in investment securities available-for-sale, and a 10,161,000, or 1.0 , decrease in net loans held-for-investment from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The increase in cash and
 cash equivalents was primarily due to an increase in deposit balances coupled with a decrease in loans due to proceeds from loan payoffs, net of loan originations, which was partially offset by an increase in investment securities due to net
 purchases of investment securities. The decrease in certificates of deposits was due to net maturities and repayments of certificates of deposit. The decrease in net loans held-for-investment was primarily due to net payoffs of agriculture,
 residential mortgage, and residential construction loans, which was partially offset by net originations of commercial, commercial real estate and consumer loans.

The liabilities of the Company set forth in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect an increase in total deposits of 39,598,000, or 2.3 , from December 31, 2023 to
 September 30, 2024. The overall increase in total deposits was primarily due to seasonal fluctuations due to changes in market conditions and monetary policy.

Provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was down 93.6 from the same period in 2023, decreasing from 3,100,000 to 200,000, and was down 210.0 for the three months ended September
 30, 2024 over the same period in 2023, decreasing from 500,000 to a reversal of provision of 550,000. The levels of forecasted national unemployment and forecasted gross domestic product remained relatively stable during the three and nine
 months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized a reversal of provision of 550 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a substantial payoff of a non-performing
 commercial loan relationship. 

Non-Interest Income 

Non-interest income was down 26.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the same period in 2023, decreasing from 6,155,000 to 4,529,000. The decrease was primarily driven by a bargain
 purchase gain recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recognized a bargain purchase gain totaling approximately 1.4 million resulting from the acquisition of the Colusa, Willows, and Orland branches located in
 California in the first quarter of 2023.

Non-interest income was down 13.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the same period in 2023, decreasing from 1,776,000 to 1,538,000. The decrease was primarily due to decreases
 in other income and losses on sales of securities.

Non-Interest Expenses 

Total non-interest expenses were down 0.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the same period in 2023, decreasing from 32,534,000 to 32,460,000. The decrease was primarily due to a
 decrease in salaries and employee benefits, which was partially offset by increases in occupancy and equipment and other expenses. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a decrease in full-time equivalent employees
 and decreases in contingent compensation and profit sharing expense. The increase in occupancy and equipment expenses was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to a full nine months of expenses related to the acquired branches
 in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to increases in loan collection expenses, which was partially offset by a decrease in legal fees.

Total non-interest expenses were up 0.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the same period in 2023, increasing from 10,883,000 to 10,934,000. The decrease was primarily due to a
 decrease in salaries and employee benefits, which was partially offset by an increase in occupancy and equipment and data processing expense. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a decrease in full-time equivalent
 employees. The increase in occupancy and equipment and data processing expense was primarily due to increases in service contracts partially due to a full year of additional processing related to new branches acquired in the first quarter of
 2023.

Index 

Asset Quality 

The Company manages asset quality and credit risk by maintaining diversification in its loan portfolio and through review processes that include analysis of credit requests and ongoing examination
 of outstanding loans and delinquencies, with particular attention to portfolio dynamics and loan mix. The Company strives to identify loans experiencing difficulty early enough to correct the problems, to record charge-offs promptly based on
 realistic assessments of collectability and current collateral values and to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses at all times. Asset quality reviews of loans and other non-performing assets are administered using credit risk-rating
 standards and criteria similar to those employed by state and federal banking regulatory agencies. The federal bank regulatory agencies utilize the following definitions for assets adversely classified for supervisory purposes:

Substandard Assets A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified have a well-defined
 weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

Doubtful Assets An asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis
 of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable or improbable.

Other Real Estate Owned and loans rated Substandard and Doubtful are deemed classified assets . This category, which includes both performing and non-performing assets, receives an elevated level
 of attention regarding collection.

The following table summarizes the Company s non-accrual loans net of guarantees of the State of California and U.S. Government by loan category at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

It is generally the Company s policy to discontinue interest accruals once a loan is past due for a period of 90 days as to interest or principal payments unless the loan is well
 secured and in process of collection. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current income. Payments received on non-accrual loans are applied against
 principal. A loan may only be restored to an accruing basis when it again becomes well secured and in the process of collection or all past due amounts have been collected or there is an extended period of positive performance and a
 high probability that the loan will continue to pay according to original terms.

Non-accrual loans amounted to 4,015,000 at September 30, 2024 and were comprised of one commercial loan totaling 139,000, one commercial real estate loan totaling 466,000, two agriculture loans
 totaling 2,380,000, four residential mortgage loans totaling 469,000 and three consumer loans totaling 561,000. Non-accrual loans amounted to 3,998,000 at December 31, 2023 and were comprised of two agriculture loans totaling 2,871,000,
 three residential mortgage loans totaling 424,000 and four consumer loans totaling 703,000.

A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. The ACL on collateral dependent loans is
 measured using the fair value of the underlying collateral, adjusted for costs to sell when applicable, less the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. It is generally the Company s policy that if the value of the underlying collateral is
 determined to be less than the recorded amount of the loan, a charge-off will be taken.

As the following table illustrates, total non-performing assets, net of guarantees of the State of California and U.S. Government, including its agencies and its government-sponsored agencies,
 decreased 4,410,000, or 52.9 , to 3,924,000 during the first nine months of 2024. Non-performing assets, net of guarantees, represented 0.2 of total assets at September 30, 2024.

The Company had one loan totaling 48,000 that was 90 days or more past due and still accruing as of September 30, 2024. The Company had two loans totaling 4,336,000 that were 90 days or more past
 due and still accruing as of December 31, 2023.

Excluding the non-performing loans, net of guaranteed loans cited previously, loans totaling 13,876,000 and 12,327,000 were classified as substandard or doubtful loans, representing potential
 problem loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 appropriately reflected expected credit losses in the loan portfolio at
 that date. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.55 at each of the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Other real estate owned OREO consists of property that the Company has acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure or through foreclosure proceedings, and property that the Company does not hold
 title to but is in actual control of, known as in-substance foreclosure. The estimated fair value of the property is determined prior to transferring the balance to OREO. The balance transferred to OREO is the estimated fair value of the property
 less estimated cost to sell. Impairment may be deemed necessary to bring the book value of the loan equal to the appraised value. Appraisals or loan officer evaluations are then conducted periodically thereafter charging any additional
 impairment to the appropriate expense account. The Company had no OREO as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

47 

Index 

Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) 

The Company s ACL is maintained at a level believed by management to appropriately reflect expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The ACL is increased by provisions charged to
 operating expense and reduced by net charge-offs. The Company contracts with vendors for credit reviews of the loan portfolio and utilizes historical loss trends and the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios to determine estimated
 credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The ACL is based on estimates, and actual losses may vary from current estimates.

The following table summarizes the ACL of the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and for the year ended December 31, 2023:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In order to serve our market area and comply with banking regulations, the Company must maintain adequate liquidity and adequate capital. Liquidity refers to the Company s ability to provide funds
 at an acceptable cost to meet loan demand and deposit withdrawals, as well as contingency plans to meet unanticipated funding needs or loss of funding sources. These objectives can be met from either the asset or liability side of the balance
 sheet.

Asset liquidity sources consist of the repayments and maturities of loans, selling of loans, short-term money market investments, maturities of securities and sales of securities from the
 available-for-sale portfolio. These activities are generally summarized as investing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net liquidity used in investing activities
 totaled 35,296,000.

The Company s available-for-sale investment securities plus cash and cash equivalents in excess of reserve requirements and certificates of deposit totaled 815,566,000 on September 30, 2024, which
 was 42.2 of assets at that date. This was an increase of 74,288,000 from 741,278,000 and 39.6 of assets as of December 31, 2023. The Company s investment securities are generally shorter term in nature to provide ongoing cash flows for
 liquidity needs and/or reinvestment for interest rate risk management. On September 30, 2024, the effective duration of our investment securities was 3.06 with projected principal cashflow of 50,012,000 for the remainder of 2024 available for
 reinvestment or liquidity needs. The Company had no held-to-maturity securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Liquidity may also be impacted from liabilities through changes in deposits and borrowings outstanding. These activities are included under financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated
 Statements of Cash Flows. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 0 in borrowings outstanding. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net liquidity provided by financing activities totaled 36,796,000, primarily due to a net increase in
 deposits. While these sources of funds are expected to continue to provide significant amounts of funds in the future, their mix, as well as the possible use of other sources, will depend on future economic and market conditions.

Liquidity is also provided or used through the results of operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities provided cash of 13,207,000.

49 

Index 

Liquidity is measured by various ratios, in management s opinion, the most common being the ratio of net loans to deposits (including loans held-for-sale). This ratio was 60.2 and 62.2 as of
 September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Loan demand during the remainder of 2024 will depend in part on economic and competitive conditions. The Company emphasizes the solicitation of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and money market
 checking accounts, which are the least sensitive to interest rates. The outlook for deposit balances during the remainder of 2024 is subject to actions by the Federal Reserve and heightened competition.

To meet unanticipated funding requirements, the Company maintains short-term unsecured lines of credit with other banks which totaled 130,000,000 at September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company
 has a line of credit with the FHLB, with a remaining borrowing capacity at September 30, 2024 of 394,192,000; credit availability is subject to certain collateral requirements.

The Company s primary source of liquidity on a stand-alone basis is dividends from the Bank. Dividends from the Bank are subject to regulatory restrictions.

In July 2013, the FRB and the other U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules making significant changes to the U.S. regulatory capital framework for U.S. banking organizations and to conform this framework
 to the guidelines published by the Basel Committee known as the Basel III Global Regulatory Framework for Capital and Liquidity. The Basel Committee is a committee of banking supervisory authorities from major countries in the global financial
 system which formulates broad supervisory standards and guidelines relating to financial institutions for implementation on a country-by-country basis. These rules adopted by the FRB and the other federal banking agencies (the U.S. Basel III
 Capital Rules) replaced the federal banking agencies general risk-based capital rules, advanced approaches rule, market risk rule, and leverage rules, in accordance with certain transition provisions.

Banks, such as First Northern, became subject to the final rules on January 1, 2015. The final rules implement higher minimum capital requirements, include a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, and
 establish criteria that instruments must meet in order to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital, or Tier 2 capital. The final rules provide for increased minimum capital ratios as follows: (a) a common equity Tier
 1 capital ratio of 4.5 ; (b) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 ; (c) a total capital ratio of 8 ; and (d) a Tier 1 leverage ratio to average consolidated assets of 4 . Under these rules, in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions,
 including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements
 (equal to 2.5 of total risk-weighted assets). The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress.

Pursuant to the EGRRCPA, the FRB adopted a final rule, effective August 31, 2018, amending the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (the policy statement to increase
 the consolidated assets threshold to qualify to utilize the provisions of the policy statement from 1 billion to 3 billion. Bank holding companies, such as the Company, are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the FRB; however, bank
 holding companies which are subject to the policy statement are not subject to compliance with the regulatory capital requirements until they hold 3 billion or more in consolidated total assets. As a consequence, as of December 31, 2018, the
 Company was not required to comply with the FRB s regulatory capital requirements until such time that its consolidated total assets equal 3 billion or more or if the FRB determines that the Company is no longer deemed to be a small bank holding
 company. However, if the Company had been subject to these regulatory capital requirements, it would have exceeded all regulatory requirements.

In August of 2020, the Federal banking agencies adopted the final version of the community bank leverage ratio framework rule (the CBLR ), implementing two interim final rules adopted in April of 2020. The rule
 provides an optional, simplified measure of capital adequacy. Under the optional CBLR framework, the CBLR was 8.5 percent through calendar year 2021 and is 9 percent thereafter. The rule is applicable to all non-advanced approaches
 FDIC-supervised institutions with less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets. Banks not electing the CBLR framework will continue to be subject to the generally applicable risk-based capital rule. At the present time, the Company and
 the Bank do not intend to elect to use the CBLR framework.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company believes that there have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of September 30, 2024, from those presented in the Company s Annual
 Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which are incorporated by reference herein.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that
 information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that
 such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our
 disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and
 procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
 evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
 no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) have concluded
 that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024. This conclusion is based on an evaluation conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management.

(b) During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
 internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Neither the Company nor the Bank is a party to any material pending legal proceeding, nor is any of their property the subject of any material pending legal proceeding, except ordinary routine
 litigation arising in the ordinary course of the Bank s business and incidental to its business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse impact upon the Company s or the Bank s business, financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

For a discussion of risk factors relating to our business, please refer to Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference herein, and to the following:

Several of California s Largest Home Insurance Providers Have Recently Paused or Severely Limited Their Issuance of New Policies, or Their Renewal of Existing Policies, in the
 State, Which Could Increase the Bank s Risk of Loss in its Loan Portfolio

At September 30, 2024, loans secured by real estate comprised approximately 87 of the total loans in the Bank s portfolio. At September 30, 2024, all of the Bank s real estate
 mortgage and construction loans were secured fully or in part by deeds of trust on underlying real estate. Most of the Company s customers, including its loan customers, are located in the State of California. 

Recently, several of California s largest home insurance providers, including State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, USAA, Travelers, Nationwide and Chubb, have either paused or severely limited their
 issuance of new policies, or their renewal of existing policies, in the state. Mounting claims from wildfire damages, the increasing cost of building and repairing homes in California, and a steep increase in reinsurance premiums, as well as
 state insurance regulations that make it difficult for insurers to adjust premiums in response to the evolving risk landscape, have challenged the capacity of insurance companies to sustainably and profitably offer home insurance in California.
 The result of these actions has been to significantly limit the availability of home insurance in California, where homeowners already face escalating property values and high wildfire, seismic, severe weather and other risks.

The California Department of Insurance enforces some safeguards to temporarily shield homeowners from the cancellation or non-renewal of home insurance policies in high-risk areas, particularly
 those prone to wildfires. In addition, the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan, a state-established risk pool, operates as an insurer of last resort, providing temporary coverage for
 California homeowners unable to obtain (generally at increased premium cost) such coverage from a traditional insurance carrier; however, enrollment in the FAIR Plan as a percentage of the total number of residential insurance policies in
 California has steadily increased over the past five years, particularly in counties with the highest wildfire risk, threatening the ongoing stability of the Plan. In late 2023, following the California Governor s declaration of a State of
 Emergency regarding property insurance, the Insurance Commissioner of the State of California introduced a comprehensive package of executive actions aimed at insurance reform. In August 2024, the California Department of Insurance
 issued proposed regulations intended to cause insurance companies to write more policies in wildfire distressed areas of California as a condition for using forward-looking wildfire modeling designed to more accurately assess wildfire risks and
 to reverse FAIR Plan growth. There can be no assurance that these regulatory actions will increase insurance availability or stabilize and strengthen California s insurance market. 

52 

Index 

Many homeowners in the State of California have been negatively impacted by the contraction of insurance options in the State and the resulting lack of access to affordable home insurance, which
 could adversely impact the ability of prospective homebuyers to obtain insurance, and escalating premiums and limited coverage options could result in limiting coverage in the event of loss. If any loss suffered by a loan customer of the Bank
 is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, this could increase the risk of loss in the Bank s loan portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. For
 additional information, see The Bank s Dependence on Real Estate Lending Increases Our Risk of Losses in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Increases in the Allowance for Credit Losses Would Adversely Affect the Bank s Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The Bank s allowance for credit losses on loans was approximately 16.4 million, or 1.55 of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 16.6 million, or 1.55 of total loans, at December 31, 2023, and 418.5 
 of total non-performing loans net of guaranteed portions at September 30, 2024, compared to 199.1 of total non-performing loans, net of guaranteed portions at December 31, 2023. Reversal of provision for credit losses totaling 550 thousand and
 provision for credit losses totaling 500 thousand for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively . Provision for credit losses totaling 200 thousand and 3.1
 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively . 

Material future additions to the allowance for estimated losses on loans may be necessary if material adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets were to continue to occur and the performance of the
 Bank s loan portfolio were to deteriorate.

Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell the property, thereby establishing the new cost basis of other real estate. Losses arising at the time of acquisition of such
 properties are charged against the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent to acquisition, such properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling expenses, determined on an individual asset basis. Any deficiency
 resulting from the excess of cost over fair value less estimated selling expenses is recognized as a valuation allowance. Any subsequent increase in fair value up to its cost basis is recorded as a reduction of the valuation allowance. The FDIC
 and the California DFPI, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for credit losses on loans and the carrying value of its assets. Increases in the provision for credit losses on loans and
 valuation allowance on foreclosed assets would adversely affect the Bank s financial condition and results of operations.

The Bank s Dependence on Real Estate Lending Increases Our Risk of Losses

The Bank s primary lending focus has historically been commercial (including agricultural), construction, and real estate mortgage. At September 30, 2024, loans secured by real estate comprised approximately 87 
 of the total loans in the Bank s portfolio. At September 30, 2024, all of the Bank s real estate mortgage and construction loans and approximately 1 of its commercial loans were secured fully or in part by deeds of trust on underlying real
 estate. The Company s dependence on real estate increases the risk of loss in both the Bank s loan portfolio and its holdings of other real estate owned if economic conditions in Northern California were to deteriorate. Deterioration of the real
 estate market in Northern California would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The CFPB has adopted various regulations which have impacted, and will continue to impact, our residential mortgage lending business.
