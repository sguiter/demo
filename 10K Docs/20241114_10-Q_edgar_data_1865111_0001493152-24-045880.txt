Business
Combination Agreement 

On
September 12, 2024, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement with OU XDATA GROUP XDATA ), a Company
incorporated in Estonia, and Roman Eloshvili, the sole shareholder of XDATA. The Business Combination Agreement provides for: (1)
the Company will incorporate a Cayman Islands exempted company PubCo in accordance with the Companies Act (Revised)
of the Cayman Islands, (2) the merger of the Company with and into PubCo (the Reincorporation
Merger ), with PubCo surviving the Reincorporation Merger, and (3) the share exchange between PubCo and the
shareholder of XDATA, resulting in XDATA being a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo. Following the Business Combination, PubCo will be
a publicly traded company. 

Pursuant
to the Business Combination Agreement and subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Company and XDATA, among other things,
at the effective time of the Reincorporation Merger , each ordinary share of the Company, par value 
per share issued and outstanding, will automatically be converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive one ordinary share
of PubCo; each issued and outstanding warrant of the Company sold to the public and to A-Star Management Corporation, in a private
placement in connection with the Company s initial public offering will automatically and irrevocably be assumed by PubCo and
converted into one corresponding warrant exercisable to purchase one-half (1/2) of one PubCo Ordinary Share, subject to the same
terms and conditions prior to the First Effective Time; and each seven issued and outstanding Rights of the Company will
automatically and irrevocably be assumed by PubCo and converted into one corresponding PubCo Ordinary Share. No fractional PubCo
Ordinary Shares will be issued in connection with such conversion and the number of PubCo Ordinary Shares to be issued to such
holder upon such conversion will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and no cash will be paid in lieu of such Rights of the
Company. Immediately prior to the First Effective Time, each issued and outstanding unit of the Company, each consisting of one
Ordinary Share, one Right and one Warrant of the Company, will be automatically separated and the holder thereof will be deemed to
hold one Ordinary Share, one Right and one Warrant of the Company. 

On September 4, 2024, Xdata Group PubCo was incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and the
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in accordance to the Business Combination Agreement. 

On September 21, 2024, the Company, PubCo and XDATA entered into an Expense Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which, XDATA agreed to bear and cover the cost in relation to Pubco s business
operating cost starting from September 1, 2024. PubCo and the Company agreed that XDATA will assume financial responsibility for
such expenses as detailed in expense reports or invoices provided by third parties or directly incurred by PubCo. As a result of the Expense Settlement Agreement, the Company recognized an other income against the liabilities the
Company would otherwise assume for PubCo during the period from September 4, 2024 (Inception) to September 30, 2024, which was offset
with PubCo s expenses. As of September 30,
2024, PubCo received invoices amounting to which was subsequently paid by XDATA. 

The
Trust Account 

As
of December 15, 2021, a total of of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement transaction completed with the
Sponsor was deposited in a trust account (the Trust Account established for the benefit of the Company s public
stockholders with Wilmington Trust, National Association acting as trustee. The amount exceeding , , had been transferred
to the Company s escrow cash account as its working capital. 

The
funds held in the Trust Account are invested only in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180
days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and investing solely in United States government treasuries. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the
Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from
the Trust Account until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or the Company s liquidation. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 
cash balance in the escrow account and had a working capital deficit of 
and ,
including the 
of the share redemption return and the over-draft of 
from Marketable Security held in trust, respectively. The 
overdraft was repaid by the Sponsor during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the 
returned redemption was distributed in October 2024. 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain
of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company related party loans up to .
On August 26, 2024, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Company may
borrow up to from the Sponsor for costs reasonably related to the Company s transaction cost and extension fee. (See Note 5) 

On
September 13, 2022, December 31, 2022, March 13, 2023, September 20, 2023 and August 26, 2024, the Company issued four promissory notes
(collectively, the Notes in the principal amount of up to ,
 ,
 ,
and 
 to the Sponsor, respectively, pursuant to which the Sponsor shall loan to the Company up to the corresponding principal
to pay the extension fee and transaction cost. See Note 5 for further information. 

If
the Company underestimates the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination
or the actual amount necessary is higher, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to the initial
Business Combination. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete its Business Combination or because
the Company has become obligated to redeem a significant number of its Public Shares upon completion of its Business Combination, in
which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. In addition, the Company
has until December 15, 2024 (the Liquidation Date to consummate a business combination. 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-40, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined
that if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the Liquidation Date, then the Company may cease all operations except
for the purpose of liquidating. The uncertainty surrounding the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management
believes that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company ha d 
insufficient working capital to cover its short-term operating needs. The Company ha d 
no revenue before the Business Combination. It incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. The
Company s cash and working capital as of September 30, 2024 were not sufficient to complete its planned activities for the
upcoming year. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern one year from
the date the financial statement is issued.

and of marketable securities held in the Trust Account as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively. 

In
January, February, and July, 2024, the total amount of was withdrawn from the Trust Account for the redemption
of public shares. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest earned from the Trust Account amounted to and , of which
 and were reinvested in the Trust Account, respectively. and were recognized as unrealized gain on investments
held in the Trust Account during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest earned from the Trust Account amounted to and ,
of which and were reinvested in the Trust Account, respectively. and were also recognized as unrealized
gain on investments held in the Trust Account during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

All
of the ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of
such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with
the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation. Accordingly,
all of the shares of ordinary shares were presented as temporary equity upon closing of the IPO. 

The
Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares
to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary
shares are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit if additional paid in capital equals to zero.
The interest earned by the marketable security held in trust, and the extension fee invested into the marketable security held in trust,
were also recognized in redemption value against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit immediately. The proceeds on the
deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to of interest to
pay dissolution expenses) will be used to fund the redemption of the public shares. 

shares. The warrants are exercisable to purchase
 ordinary shares in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other
contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted
net income (loss) per ordinary shares is the same as basic net income (loss) per ordinary share for the periods presented.

of applicable law), and the Private Units and all underlying securities will expire worthless.

On December 15, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full, so there are no Founder Shares subject to forfeiture

Contingencies
and Dismissal of the Then-Legal Counsel 

The
Company may from time to time be subject to various legal or administrative claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no legal or administrative proceedings for which a loss was probable
and expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 

On
February 5, 2024, the management and the Sponsor determined to dismiss the Company s then-legal counsel and also terminated
its services of maintaining and managing the escrow account. The former legal counsel alleged that there was an approximate 
balance due with the Sponsor and disputed legal fee due from the Company. On May 23, 2024, the Sponsor and the Company entered into
an indemnity agreement that contractually indemnifies, holds harmless, and exonerates the Company from any potential litigation or
related proceedings arising from the service termination with the former legal counsel. The Company does not believe that either the
above Sponsor Balance due to the former legal counsel or the disputed legal fee would have a material impact on the
Company s unaudited consolidated financial statements.

days notice, only in the event that the last sale price of the ordinary shares is at least per share for any trading
days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is given, provided there
is an effective registration statement and current prospectus in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants
during the 30-day redemption period. If a registration statement is not effective within days following the consummation of a business
combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company
shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption
from registration under the Securities Act.

with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per share (with such
issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors), (b) the aggregate gross proceeds from
such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business
combination, and (c) the volume weighted average trading price of the ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the

Value, and the last sales price of the ordinary shares that triggers the Company s right to redeem the Warrants will be adjusted
(to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the Market Value. 

Private
warrants 

The
private warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had private warrants outstanding, respectively. 

Rights 

Except
in cases where the Company is not the surviving Company in a business combination, the holders of the rights will automatically receive
1/7 of a share of ordinary shares upon consummation of the Company s initial business combination. In the event the Company will
not be the surviving company upon completion of the initial business combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively
convert his, her or its rights in order to receive the 1/7 of a share underlying each right upon consummation of the business combination.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no rights had been converted into shares.

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 11, 2021 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange,
asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate
our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units, our shares,
debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

We
expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business
Combination will be successful. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through September
30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying
a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenue until after the completion of our initial
Business Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the
Trust Account. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting,
accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business
Combination. 

On September 4, 2024, we established a wholly owned subsidiary, Xdata Group, in Cayman Islands, and serves as PubCo for our initial business
combination in accordance to the Business Combination Agreement entered on September 12, 2024. Xdata Group PubCo) has no operations,
and only had limited activities. By arrangement, all financial liabilities of PubCo will be assumed by the third-party target company. 

17 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net (loss) income of (139,268) and 1,322,882, which consist ed 
of operating costs of 459,346 and 808,801, offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 
278,247 and 2,089,852 and unrealized interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 41,831 and 41,831,
respectively. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 1,232,740 and 3,718,369, which consist ed 
of operating costs of 104,592 and 316,908, offset by interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of
 916,726 and 3,614,671 and unrealized interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 420,606 and 420,606,
respectively. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
December 15, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 11,500,000 units (including the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters
in the IPO) at 10.00 per unit (the Public Units ), generating gross proceeds of 115,000,000. Each Unit consists of one
ordinary share, one redeemable warrant to purchase one-half (1/2) ordinary share (each a Warrant , and, collectively, the
 Warrants ), and one right to receive one-seventh (1/7) of an ordinary share upon the consummation of a Business Combination.
Simultaneously with the IPO, the Company sold to its Sponsor 330,000 units at 10.00 per unit in a private placement generating total
gross proceeds of 3,300,000. Offering costs amounted to 5,669,696 consisting of 2,300,000 of underwriting fees, 2,875,000 of deferred
underwriting fees, and 494,696 of other offering costs. Apart from 25,000 for the subscription of ordinary shares, the Company received
net proceeds of 115,682,250 from the IPO and the private placement. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 82,524. Net income of 1,322,882 consisted of formation
and operating costs 808,801, offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in trust of 2,089,852 and unrealized interest
earned on marketable securities held in trust of 41,831. Net cash used in financing activities was 92,857,282, consisting of 93,382,282
for the redemption of public shares offset by the proceed of sponsor promissory note 525,000. Net cash provided by investing activities
was 92,774,758, consisting of 525,000 extension contributions deposited into the marketable security held in trust account and offset by 93,299,758
cash withdrawn from trust account to redeem public shares. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 126,796. Net income of 3,718,369 consisted of
formation and operating costs 316,908, offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in trust of 3,614,671 and
unrealized interest earned on marketable securities held in trust of 420,606. Net cash used in financing activities was 22,896,037
which consisted of 3,316,281 from the proceeds of the sponsor promissory note, offset by 26,094,884 redemption of public shares. Net cash provided by investing activities was
 3,206,347 extension contributions deposited into the marketable security held in trust account, offset by 7,500 operating expense paid out of the Trust Account and 26,094,884 cash withdrawn from the Trust Account to redeem public
shares. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 10,962,587. We intend to use substantially all of the
funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, excluding deferred underwriting
commissions, to complete our Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. To the extent
that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete a Business Combination, the remaining proceeds
held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other
acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

18 

At
September 30, 2024, we had cash in escrow of nil held outside of the Trust Account. We intend to raise funds through borrowing from Sponsor,
and use the funds to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel
to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate
documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 

In
order to complete a Business Combination, the Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from
its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not
obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion,
to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company
is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but
not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses.
The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern if a Business Combination is not
consummated. 

The
Company had issued the following promissory notes (collectively, the Notes ): 

On
September 13, 2022, December 13, 2022. March 13, 2023, September 20, 2023 and August 26, 2024 the Company issued four promissory
notes in the principal amount of up to 1,000,000 ,
 1,300,000 ,
 2,500,000, and
 2,500,000 ,
respectively, to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor shall loan to the Company up to the related amount to pay the extension
fee and transaction cost. The Notes are repayable in full upon the date of the consummation of the Company s initial business
combination pursuant to the Notes and related amendments. The Notes have no conversion feature, no collateral and bear no
interest. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company drew down 525,000
from the Notes to pay the extension contribution of 70,000
each month from January to June 2024, and 35,000
each month from July to September 2024, respectively. The full amounts were deposited into the Trust Account immediately. 

On August 26, 2024, we entered into a Loan Agreement with our Sponsor for a 1.5 million loan to cover transaction costs and extension
fee. The loan is non-interest bearing and payable upon the completion of the initial business combination. The loan also covers amount
we received prior to the agreement, that was the Sponsor s payments on behalf of us in prior period which was the balance of due to Sponsor
of 738,769. 

On
September 25, 2024, the Company entered into supplemental agreements with its Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agrees to waive the principal
balance of the Notes and the Sponsor loan in the amount of 6,245,961 and 746,270, respectively. 

After the waiver, as of September 30, 2024, the balance of the Notes and the Sponsor loan was 35,000 and nil, respectively, and the remaining
balance available under the Notes and the Sponsor loan was 1,019,039 and 761,231, respectively. 

We
believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. If our estimate
of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination is less than
the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business
Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated
to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional
securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. 

19 

Off-Balance
Sheets Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheets arrangements as September 30, 2024. We do not
participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable
interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheets arrangements. We have not entered
into any off-balance sheets financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other
entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement
to pay the Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for certain general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and administrative
services, provided to the Company. We began incurring these fees on December 15, 2021 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until
the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination and the Company s liquidation. 

The
underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of two and one-half percent (2.5 of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering,
or 2,875,000. The deferred fee will be paid in cash upon the closing of a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account,
subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and
income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the
following critical accounting policies: 

Warrants 

The
Company evaluates the Public and Private Warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment
of the warrants specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification( ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments
pursuant to ASC 480 and meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements
for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares, among
other conditions for equity classification. Pursuant to such evaluation, both Public and Private Warrants are classified in stockholders 
equity. 

Ordinary
Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 

The
Company accounts for its ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are
classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares
that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain
events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified
as stockholders equity. The Company s ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside
of the Company s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible
redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of the Company s
condensed balance sheets. 

The
Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares
to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary
shares are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit if additional paid in capital equals to zero. 

20 

Basic
and diluted net income (loss) per share 

The
Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. In order to determine
the net income (loss) attributable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, the Company first considered the undistributed
income (loss) allocable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares and the undistributed income (loss) is calculated using
the total net income (loss) less any dividends paid. The Company then allocated the undistributed income (loss) rateably based on the
weighted average number of shares outstanding between the redeemable and non-redeemable shares. Any remeasurement of the accretion to
redemption value of the ordinary shares subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public stockholders. 

The
calculation of diluted net income (loss) per ordinary shares and related weighted average of the ordinary shares does not consider the
effect of the warrants and rights issued in connection with the (i) Initial Public Offering, and (ii) the private placement since the
exercise of the warrants and rights are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. The warrants are exercisable to purchase 5,915,000
shares of ordinary shares in the aggregate, and the rights are exercisable to convert 1,690,000 shares of ordinary shares in the aggregate.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or
converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company other than above. As a result, diluted net income (loss)
per ordinary shares is the same as basic net income (loss) per ordinary shares for the periods presented. 

Recent
accounting standards 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering,
the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering, including amounts in the Trust Account, have been invested in certain U.S. government
securities with a maturity of 180 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term
nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, relating to ineffective
review and approval procedures over journal entries and financial statement preparation which resulted in errors not being timely identified
in previously issued consolidated financial statements, such as the misclassification of the trust account balance and deferred underwriting
commissions payable as current assets and current liabilities instead of non-current assets and non-current liabilities, respectively.
We concluded that the failure to timely identify such accounting errors constituted a material weakness as defined in the SEC regulations.
As such, management determined that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange
Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

To
respond to this material weakness, we have devoted, and plan to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation
and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable
accounting requirements, we plan to enhance our system of evaluating and implementing the complex accounting standards that apply to
our consolidated financial statements. Our plans at this time include providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials
and documents and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting
applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives
will ultimately have the intended effects, or that any additional material weaknesses or of financial results will not arise in the future
due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. Even
if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to
prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

The
Company is not party to any legal proceedings as of the filing date of this Form 10-Q. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our annual
report on the Form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 under Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A Risk
Factors, filed with the SEC. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations
or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business
or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, other than those set out below. 

If we fail to meet applicable continued listing
requirements, Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading, in which case the liquidity and market price of our securities could decline. 

On October 1, 2024, we received a written notification (the Notification
Letter from Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum market value of listed securities set forth
in Nasdaq s rules for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) requires primary securities
listed on the Nasdaq Global Market to maintain a minimum market value of listed securities of 50,000,000, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C)
provides that a failure to meet the minimum market value of listed securities requirement exists if a deficiency under Rule 5450(b)(2)(A)
continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the market value of listed securities for the 30 consecutive business
days beginning August 12, 2024, and continuing to the present, the Company is not in compliance with the minimum market value of listed
securities requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has been provided a cure period of 180 calendar
days, or until March 31, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum market value of listed securities requirement (the Compliance
Period ). To regain compliance, the market value of listed securities must meet or exceed 50,000,000 for at least 10 consecutive
business days during the Compliance Period. If the Company does not regain compliance during such cure period, the Company s securities
will be subject to delisting. In that event, the Company may appeal such determination to a hearing panel. The Company will make its best
efforts to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A) prior to the expiration of the Compliance Period. 

If our securities are delisted by Nasdaq, our securities may be eligible
for quotation on an over-the-counter quotation system or on the pink sheets but will lack the benefits and market efficiencies
associated with a Nasdaq listing. Upon delisting, our securities would become subject to the regulations of the SEC relating to the market
for penny stocks. The regulations applicable to penny stocks may severely affect market liquidity in respect of our securities and could
limit the ability of shareholders to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of and/or dispose of our securities. In such case,
there can be no assurance that our securities will be again be eligible for listing on any recognized exchange. 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Company s IPO, the Company consummated the private placement Private Placement with its
sponsor, A-Star Management Corp., a British Virgin Islands company Sponsor for the purchase of 330,000 Units (the Private
Units at a price of 10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of 3,300,000, pursuant to the Private Placement Unit
Purchase Agreement dated December 13, 2021. Each Private Unit purchased by the Sponsor consists of one Shares, one right to receive one-seventh
1/7) of a Share upon the consummation of a business combination and one private placement warrant exercisable to purchase one-half (1/2)
of one Share at a price of 10.00 per Share. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering. 

Use
of Proceeds 

The
registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 13,
2021. We completed our initial public offering on December 15, 2021. In our initial public offering, we sold units at an offering price
of 10.00 and consisting of one ordinary share, one right and one redeemable warrant. Each right entitles the holders thereof to receive
one seventh (1/7) of one ordinary shares upon the consumption of the initial business combination. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof
to purchase one-half of one ordinary share. We will not issue fractional shares in connection with the exercise of the warrants. In connection
with our initial public offering, we sold 11,500,000 units, generating gross proceeds of 115,000,000. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Units Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and our sponsor, A-Star
Management Corporation, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 330,000 units (the Private Placement Units to the Sponsor at a purchase price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 3,300,000. 

Transaction
costs related to our IPO amounted to 5,669,696, consisting of 2,300,000 of underwriting fees, 2,875,000 of deferred underwriting fees
and 494,696 of other offering costs. A total of 115,000,000, comprised of 112,700,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes
up to 2,875,000 of the underwriter s deferred discount) and 2,300,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units,
was placed in a U.S.-based Trust Account maintained at Wilmington Trust, National Association, acting as trustee. Except with respect
to interest earned on the funds in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the funds held in the Trust
Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company s initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the Company s public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote
to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of its
obligation to redeem 100 of the Company s public shares if it does not complete its initial business combination within 9 months
from the closing of the IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of the IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business
combination), or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity,
and (iii) the redemption of the Company s public shares if it is unable to complete its initial business combination within 9 months
from the closing of the IPO (or up to 27 months from the consummation of the IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business
combination). At the Annual General Meeting held on July 13, 2023, shareholders approved the amendments of the Company s Amended
and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination to
March 15, 2024. At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on January 10, 2024, shareholders approved the amendments of the Company s
Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination
to September 15, 2024 (33 months from the consummation of the IPO). At the Annual General Meeting held on July 12, 2024, shareholders
approved the amendments of the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which
the Company must consummate a business combination to December 15, 2024.
