NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

million and net cash outflows from operations
of 
 million for the fiscal year ended 2023. The Company incurred
a net loss of million
for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and net cash outflows from operations of 
 million. This net loss of 
 million includes an estimated 
 million of possible damages related to a jury
verdict which is explained below. In addition, the Company has experienced a significant decline in its cash and cash equivalents and
marketable securities over the last several years, which was primarily a result of funding operating losses. As described in Note 14
Litigation, on April 22, 2024, a jury verdict was entered against the Company awarding approximately 
 million in damages as well as recommending 
 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages.
On May 22, 2024, the Company filed its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as two submissions
arguing that the disgorgement and exemplary damages should not be awarded. That same day, BlueRadios filed motions seeking a permanent
injunction prohibiting Kopin from selling any products that incorporate BlueRadios trade secrets, over 
 million in pre-judgment interest, and over 
 million in attorneys fees and costs. While
no final judgment has been issued by the Court, the Court will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment
on the final amount after briefing on the issues. Final briefings on the motions were made by the parties on October 29, 2024. The Company
is also considering the appeal of any award in a final judgment. The Company had 
 million of cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash, and marketable securities at September 28, 2024. 

The
Company has historical and current negative cash flow from operations and limited liquidity resources. The Company s current strategy
is to continue to invest in its business and raise additional capital through financing activities that may include public offerings
and private placements of its common stock, preferred stock offerings, collaborations and licensing arrangements and issuances of debt
and convertible debt instruments. Until such time that additional capital can be raised, the Company plans to strategically manage its
uncommitted spending, execute its priorities and implement cost saving measures to reduce research and development and general and administrative
expenditures which could include minimizing staff costs. The Company may also sell assets and look at other strategic alternatives. There
are inherent uncertainties associated with fundraising activities and activities to manage our uncommitted spending and the successful
execution of these activities may not be within the Company s control. There are no assurances that such additional funding will
be obtained and that the Company will succeed in its future operations. If the Company is unable to achieve positive cash flows and profitability
in the foreseeable future, cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement its strategic plan, or the recommended disgorgement
and exemplary damages are not significantly reduced or eliminated in the final order, the Company s liquidity, financial condition
and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected. There is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2024, and represents cash deposited
by the Company into a separate account and designated as collateral for a standby letter of credit in the same amount in accordance with
a contractual agreement with a vendor. The restricted cash balance at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 is invested in certificates
of deposit and money market funds. The restricted cash balance that is invested in certificates of deposit is classified as marketable securities. 

Marketable
securities consist primarily of commercial paper, medium-term corporate notes, and U.S. Government and agency-backed securities. The
Company classifies these marketable securities as available-for-sale at fair value in Marketable securities, at
fair value. The Company records the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on marketable securities in the
results of operations. 

The
Company uses the specific identification method as a basis for determining cost and calculating realized gains and losses with respect
to marketable securities. The gross gains and losses realized related to sales and maturities of marketable securities were
not material during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because
of their short-term nature. If accrued liabilities were carried at fair value, these would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy. 

Marketable Securities 

Corporate
debt consists of floating rate notes with a maturity that may be over multiple years but has interest rates that are reset every
three months. US government and agency-backed securities consist of high-quality U.S. Government and government-backed (e.g., Fannie
Mae, FDIC guaranteed bonds and certificates of deposit) securities. The Company validates the fair market values of the financial
instruments above by using discounted cash flow models, obtaining independent pricing of the securities or through the use of a
model that incorporates the three-month interest rate, the credit default swap rate of the issuer and the bid and ask price spread
of the same or similar investments which are traded on several markets. 

Equity
Investments 

The
Company has an investment in RealWear Inc. (RealWear) which had been valued at 
million. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company received shares valued at approximately million
as payment of royalties. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company reviewed the financial condition and an observable price point
in an equity transaction, and as a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of 
million to reduce the value of the investment to 
million. In both the second and third quarters of 2024, the Company reviewed the financial condition and an observable price point
in an equity transaction, and as a result, recorded impairment charges of 
million and 
million, respectively, to reduce the value of the investment to 
million. As of September 28, 2024, the Company owned an approximate 
interest in this investment. 

The
equity investments categorized as Level 1 at September 28, 2024 were the Company s equity investments in publicly traded companies
that met the categorization requirements for Level 1 classification. 

The
equity investments that were not remeasured to fair value and therefore did not meet the Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 classification requirements
had a value of million at September 28, 2024. 

As of September 28, 2024, the Level 3 equity investments include the Company s
investment in RealWear of million and the value of an additional equity investment.

per share of the common stock less the per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. 

Non-Vested
Restricted Common Stock 

The
fair value of non-vested restricted common stock awards is generally the market value of the Company s common stock on the date
of grant. The non-vested restricted common stock awards require the employee to fulfill certain obligations, including remaining employed
by the Company for one, two or four years (the vesting period) and in certain cases also require meeting either performance criteria
or the Company s stock achieving a certain price. For non-vested restricted common stock awards that solely require the recipient
to remain employed with the Company, the stock compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated service period. For non-vested
restricted common stock awards that require the achievement of performance criteria, the Company reviews the probability of achieving
the performance goals on a periodic basis. If the Company determines that it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved,
the amount of compensation cost derived for the performance goal is amortized over the anticipated service period. If the performance
criteria are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. 

The
Company granted and restricted stock units to its employees, executives and the Board of Directors in the nine months
ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. For fiscal year 2024, shares are part of an incentive program
that would vest upon the successful achievement of certain fiscal year 2024 milestones. Through September 28, 2024, shares were
earned upon the achievement of milestones, were forfeited for failure to meet milestones, and may still be earned for
achieving milestones in 2024. The fair value of the restricted stock units was based on the fair market value of the Company s
stock on the date of grant. The time-based shares are expensed over the service period and the milestone-based shares are expensed based
upon the probability of achievement.

of September 28, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was million
which the Company expects to recognize over the next 12 months. The remaining performance obligations represent amounts to be earned
under government contracts, which are subject to cancellation.

On May 22, 2024, the Company filed its Motion for
Judgment as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as two submissions arguing that the disgorgement and exemplary
damages should not be awarded. That same day, BlueRadios filed motions seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Kopin from selling
any products that incorporate BlueRadios trade secrets, over million in pre-judgment interest, and over million in attorneys 
fees and costs. Briefing on those issues concluded on June 26, 2024. On September 25, 2024, the Company filed a supplemental brief on
issue preclusion arguing that BlueRadios claims were untimely because of findings of fact made in BlueRadios, Inc. v. Hamilton,
Brook, Smith Reynolds, P.C. , No. 1:21-cv-10488-DJC, ECF 268 (D. Mass. Sept. 18, 2024). That supplemental briefing concluded
on October 29, 2024. The Company is currently considering an appeal of any final judgment. The Company accrued million in damages
as well as million in disgorgement and exemplary damages, which was recorded in the financial statements for the nine months ended September 28, 2024.

which are subject to the safe harbor created by such sections. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, 
 plans, believes, could, would, seeks, estimates, 
and variations of such words and similar expressions, and the negatives thereof, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
made, and advise readers that these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties,
estimates, and assumptions by us that are difficult to predict. Various factors, some of which are beyond our control, could cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements,
whether written or oral, and whether made by us or on our behalf, are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements and any other
cautionary statements that may accompany the forward-looking statements. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, except as may otherwise be required by the federal securities
laws. 

We
have identified the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking
statements. Such factors may be in addition to the risks described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors; Part II, Item 7. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and other parts of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 30, 2023. These factors include: our ability to source semiconductor components and other raw materials used in the
manufacturing of our products; our ability to prosecute and defend our proprietary technology aggressively or successfully; our ability
to retain personnel with experience and expertise relevant to our business; our ability to invest in research and development to achieve
profitability even during periods when we are not profitable; our ability to continue to introduce new products in our target markets;
our ability to generate revenue growth and positive cash flow, and reach profitability; the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its
effects on the price of our products in foreign markets; the impact of new regulations and customer demands relating to conflict minerals;
our ability to obtain a competitive advantage in the wearable technologies market through our extensive portfolio of patents, trade secrets
and non-patented know-how; our ability to grow within our targeted markets; the importance of small form factor displays in the development
of defense, consumer, and industrial products such as thermal weapon sights, safety equipment, virtual and augmented reality gaming,
training and simulation products and metrology tools; the suitability of our properties for our needs for the foreseeable future; our
expectation not to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future and to retain earnings for the development of our businesses; our need
to achieve and maintain positive cash flow and profitability; and our expectation that if we do not achieve and maintain positive cash
flow and profitability; our financial condition will ultimately be materially adversely affected, and we will be required to reduce expenses,
including our investments in research and development or raise additional capital and our ability to support our operations and capital
needs for at least the next twelve months through our available cash resources. 

Overview 

We
are a leading developer, manufacturer and seller of miniature displays and optical lenses (our components for sale as
individual displays, components, modules or higher-level subassemblies. We also license our intellectual property through technology
license agreements. Our component products are used in highly demanding high-resolution portable defense, enterprise and consumer electronic
applications, training and simulation equipment and 3D metrology equipment. Our products enable our customers to develop and market an
improved generation of products for these target applications.

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 and
our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 

Results
of Operations 

Our
interim period results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of such results may not be indicative of our future operating results.
Additionally, we use a fiscal calendar, that may result in differences in the number of workdays in the current and comparable prior
interim periods and could affect period-to-period comparisons. The following discussion of comparative results of operations among periods
should be viewed in this context. 

Revenues.
 For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our revenues by display application, which include
product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts R D ), were as follows:

Sales
of our products for Defense applications include systems used by the military both in the field and for training and simulation. The
increase in Defense applications revenues in the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in revenues from products used in thermal weapon sights and to a lesser extent
due to an increase in revenues from sales of products used in pilot helmets. The increase in Defense applications revenues in the
nine months ended September 28, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in
revenues from products used in thermal weapon sights partially offset by a decline in revenues from sales of products used in pilot
helmets. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company plans on devoting production resources to provide units that customers have made
warranty claims on, which may impact our fourth quarter revenues. 

Industrial
applications revenue represents customers who purchase our display products for use in 3D metrology equipment and headsets used for applications
in manufacturing, distribution, and public safety. Our 3D metrology customers are primarily located in Asia and sell to Asian contract
manufacturers who use the 3D metrology machines for quality control purposes. The increase in Industrial applications revenues for the
three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to an increase in sales
of products for 3D metrology. The decrease in Industrial applications revenues for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in sales of products for 3D metrology. 

Our
displays for Consumer applications are used primarily in thermal imaging products in recreational rifles, first person viewers, and hand-held
scopes. The decrease in Consumer applications revenues for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in sales for hand-held thermal viewers. 

R D
revenues decreased in the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due
to decreases in funding for U.S. defense programs. R D revenues decreased in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in funding for U.S. defense programs as certain programs were
completed and customers are evaluating the results and certain programs transitioned to production programs. Included in R D revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is approximately 400,000 related to OLED development programs with a consumer customer. 

International
revenues represented 5 and 7 of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and 6 and
12 of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We categorize our revenues as either
domestic or international based upon the delivery destination of our product. For example, if the customer is located in Asia or if
a U.S. customer has its Asian contract manufacturer order product from us and we deliver the product to Asia, then we categorize
both of these sales as international. In addition, if we earn royalties on sales from a customer, the royalties are categorized as
domestic or international based on how the product revenues are categorized. The decrease in international revenues was a result of
a decrease in sales of our OLED products and our display products for 3D metrology applications. Our international sales are
primarily denominated in U.S. currency. Consequently, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the price in local
currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors products that
are denominated in local currencies, which could lead to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets. We have not
taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations, such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such
fluctuations, because of the historically stable exchange rate between the British Pound Sterling (the functional currency of our
U.K. subsidiary) and the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency translation impact on our results, if material, is described in further
detail under Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section below.

Cost
of Product Revenues. Cost of product revenues, which is comprised of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead related to the production
of our products for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:

The
decrease in cost of product revenue as a percent of net product revenues for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 as
compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in expected program costs as a result of lower
estimate of rework costs. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company plans on devoting production resources to provide units for
which customers have made warranty claims. As the Company has already accrued an estimate of the cost to repair these units, we
do not expect this to have a material impact on Cost of product revenues as a percentage of net product revenues. 

During
2023, our manufacturing was impacted by a shortage of several semiconductor components from our normal vendors that are necessary to
manufacture our products. For some components we were able to identify and use other sources for the components but for some components
primarily used in defense related products, we were not able to avail ourselves of alternate components because their use would have
required a requalification of our product by our customer. While the shortage of certain semiconductor components situation has improved,
occasional disruptions do occur which may impact our ability to ship product. 

Research
and Development. R D expenses are incurred in support of internal display development programs and programs funded by agencies
or prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial partners. R D costs include staffing, purchases of materials and laboratory
supplies, circuit design costs, fabrication and packaging of display products, and overhead. In fiscal year 2024, our R D
expenditures are related to our display products, overlay weapon sights and OLED display technologies. Funded and internal R D
expenses are combined in research and development expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. R D expenses for
the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:

R D expense for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 decreased as compared to the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023 primarily due to decreased spending on U.S. defense programs and programs previously in development were completed. Internal
R D expense increased due to an increase in display development costs. 

Selling,
General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative S,G A expenses consist of the expenses incurred
by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses, and administrative and general corporate expenses. S,G A expenses for

S,G A
increased for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an
increase in legal fees of 0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in public relation expense of 0.1 million. S,G A increased
for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in
legal fees of 3.8 million partially offset by a decrease in credit loss expense of 0.7 million. 

Litigation
Damages. Litigation damages were accrued as a result of the April 22, 2024 jury verdict that was entered against us, awarding
approximately 5.1 million in damages as well as recommending 19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages. 

Other
(Expense) Income, net. Other (expense) income, net, is primarily composed of interest income, foreign currency transactions,
losses on fair value recording of investments and remeasurement gains and losses incurred by our U.K.-based subsidiary and other
non-operating income items. Other (expense) income, net, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and

respectively, as compared to foreign currency losses of less than 0.1 million and 0.2 million for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively. Other (expense) income, net for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September
30, 2023 includes 1.6 million and 3.3 million of impairment losses on equity investments, respectively. 

Tax
Provision. We recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately 0.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024.
We recorded a provision for income taxes of less than 0.1 million and approximately 0.1 million in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Net
Loss. We incurred net losses of 3.5 million and 41.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively,
compared to net losses of 2.5 million and 13.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The
decrease in net loss during the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily
due to an improvement of gross margins and foreign currency gains partially offset by an increase in legal expense. The increase in the
net loss during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to accrued
litigation damages and legal fees. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities of 37.3 million
and 17.9 million, respectively, and working capital of 19.1 million and 24.0 million, respectively. The change in cash and cash equivalents
and marketable securities was primarily due to an equity raise of 25.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 in addition to the sale
of common stock of 7.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 which was partially offset by cash used in operations of 12.6 million.
Our cash and cash equivalents and liquidity could be adversely affected by any amounts that become payable in connection with any adverse
results from any litigation we are, or may become, involved in. 

21 

On
September 23, 2024, we sold 37,550,000 shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of
common stock at a public offering price of 0.64 per pre-funded warrant, for gross proceeds of 27.0 million before deducting underwriting
discounts and offering expenses paid by the us of 1.8 million. The offering price of the pre-funded warrant equals the public offering
price per share of the common stock less the 0.01 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. 

On September 30, 2024, we sold 2,405,000 shares of common stock and received gross proceeds of 1.5 million. 

During
the three months ended March 30, 2024, we sold 3,080,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of 7,466,755 (average of 2.42 per
share) before deducting broker expenses paid by us of approximately 0.2 million, pursuant to our then effective At-The-Market Equity
Offering Sales Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2021 (the ATM Agreement with Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated Stifel ), as agent. The ATM Agreement terminated in the three months ended March 30, 2024. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred net losses of 19.7 million and net cash outflows
from operations of 15.3 million for the fiscal year ended 2023. We incurred a net loss of 41.9 million for the nine months
ended September 28, 2024 and net cash outflows from operations of 12.6 million. In addition, we have experienced a significant
decline in its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities over the last several years, which was primarily a result of funding
operating losses. As described in Note 14 Litigation, on April 22, 2024, a jury verdict was entered against us awarding approximately
 5.1 million in damages as well as recommending 19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages. While no final judgment has been
issued by the Court, the Court will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment on the final amount
after briefing on the issues. We have argued that the damages, disgorgement and exemplary damages should be reduced or eliminated.
Final briefing on the issued occurred on October 29, 2024. We are also considering the appeal of any award in a final judgment.
We had 37.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities at September 28, 2024. 

We have had historical and current negative cash flow from operations and limited liquidity resources. Our current strategy
is to continue to invest in its business and raise additional capital through financing activities that may include public offerings
and private placements of our common stock, preferred stock offerings, collaborations and licensing arrangements and issuances of debt
and convertible debt instruments. Until such time that additional capital can be raised, we plan to strategically manage its
uncommitted spending, execute its priorities and implement cost saving measures to reduce research and development and general and administrative
expenditures which could include minimizing staff costs. We may also sell assets and look at other strategic alternatives. There
are inherent uncertainties associated with fundraising activities and activities to manage our uncommitted spending and the successful
execution of these activities may not be within our control. There are no assurances that such additional funding will
be obtained and that we will succeed in our future operations. If we are unable to achieve positive cash flows and profitability
in the foreseeable future or cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement its strategic plan, our liquidity, financial
condition and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected. Unless the recommended disgorgement and exemplary damages
are significantly reduced or eliminated in the final order, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. 

Cash

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We
invest our excess cash in high-quality U.S. Government, government-backed (e.g., Fannie Mae, FDIC guaranteed bonds and certificates of
deposit) and corporate debt instruments, which bear lower levels of relative risk. We believe that the effect, if any, of reasonably
possible near-term changes in interest rates on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows should not be material to
our cash flows or income. It is possible that interest rate movements would increase our unrealized gain or loss on debt securities.
We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily through our translation of our foreign subsidiaries financial
position, results of operations, and transaction gains and losses as a result of non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows related to business
activities in Europe, and remeasurement of U.S. dollars to the British pound, the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiaries. We are
also exposed to the effects of exchange rates in the purchase of certain raw materials, which are in U.S. dollars, but the price on future
purchases is subject to change based on the relationship of the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar. We do not currently hedge our foreign
currency exchange rate risk. We estimate that any market risk associated with our international operations or investments is unlikely
to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Our portfolio of marketable securities
is subject to interest rate risk although our intent is to hold securities until maturity. The credit rating of our investments may be
affected by the underlying financial health of the guarantors of our investments. We use silicon wafers but do not enter into forward
or futures hedging contracts to mitigate against risks related to the price of silicon. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of September 28, 2024, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, respectively) regarding the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 28, 2024, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). The term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the requisite time periods and that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of
September 28, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

The
Company may engage in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are
inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters and our business, financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period. 

BlueRadios,
Inc. v. Kopin Corporation, Civil Action No. 16-02052-JLK (D. Col.): 

On
August 12, 2016, BlueRadios, Inc. BlueRadios filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado,
alleging that the Company breached a contract between it and BlueRadios concerning a joint venture between the Company and BlueRadios
to design, develop and commercialize micro-display products with embedded wireless technology referred to as Golden-i, 
breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing associated with that contract, breached its fiduciary duty to BlueRadios, and misappropriated
trade secrets owned by BlueRadios in violation of Colorado law (C.R.S. 7-74-104(4)) and the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C.
 1836(b)(1)). BlueRadios further alleged that the Company was unjustly enriched by its alleged misconduct, BlueRadios is entitled
to an accounting to determine the amount of profits obtained by the Company as a result of its alleged misconduct, and the inventorship
on at least ten patents or patent applications owned by the Company need to be corrected to list BlueRadios employees as inventors
and thereby list BlueRadios as co-assignees of the patents. BlueRadios seeks monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, including
for alleged non-payment of engineering retainer fees. 

On
October 11, 2016, the Company filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses. The parties completed expert depositions on November 15,
2019. On December 2, 2019, the Company filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment requesting the Court dismiss counts 2-7 in their
entirety and counts 1 and 8 in part. BlueRadios also filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment alleging it is the co-owner of U.S.
Patent No. 8,909,296. Responses to the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment were filed on January 15, 2020, and replies were filed
on February 19, 2020. On September 25, 2020, the Court denied BlueRadios Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. On August 3,
2022, the Court granted the Company s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by dismissing counts 3, 6, 7, the claim for punitive
damages under count 2, and count 8 as it relates to patent applications and by denying the motion as it relates to counts 1, 4, and
5, and the remainder of counts 2 and 8. The Court also ordered discovery reopened for certain limited purposes. A trial date was set
by the Court for January 22 to February 5, 2024 but then re-scheduled for March 20 to April 16. On Monday, April 22, 2024, after a
four week trial, a jury verdict was entered finding for BlueRadios and awarding approximately 5.1 million in damages as well as
recommending 19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages. While no final judgment has been issued by the Court, the Court
will take that recommendation under advisement and will rule in its final judgment on the final amount after post-trial briefing. On
May 22, 2024, the Company filed its Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as two
submissions arguing that the disgorgement and exemplary damages should not be awarded. That same day, BlueRadios filed motions
seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting Kopin from selling any products that incorporate BlueRadios trade secrets, over
 10 million in pre-judgment interest, and over 10 million in attorneys fees and costs. Briefing on those issues concluded on
June 26, 2024. On September 25, 2024, the Company filed a supplemental brief on issue preclusion arguing that BlueRadios 
claims were untimely because of findings of fact made in BlueRadios, Inc. v. Hamilton, Brook, Smith Reynolds, P.C. , No.
1:21-cv-10488-DJC, ECF 268 (D. Mass. Sept. 18, 2024). That supplemental briefing concluded on October 29, 2024. The Company is
currently considering an appeal of any final judgment. The Company accrued 5.1 million in damages as well as 19.7 million in
disgorgement and exemplary damages, which was recorded in the financial statements for the nine months ended September 28, 2024.

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Our
business and financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. As a result, the risks and uncertainties discussed in
Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. There have been no material changes
in the assessment of our risk factors from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023,
except for the risk factors noted below. 

We
may not comply with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of
the Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock could be delisted, which could affect our common stock s market price and liquidity
and reduce our ability to raise capital. 

Our
common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market which imposes continued listing requirements with respect to listed shares.
On October 14, 2024, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of Nasdaq, indicating that
our common stock was subject to potential delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market because, for a period of thirty (30) consecutive business
days, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq
Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Requirement ). Nasdaq stated in its letter that
in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have been provided an initial period of one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, or until
April 14, 2025 (the Compliance Date ), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. The letter states that Nasdaq
will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with the Bid Price Requirement if at any time before the Compliance
Date, the bid price of our common stock closes at 1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive business days. 

If
we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance Date, we may be eligible for
an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. To qualify, we will be required to meet the continued listing requirement
for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of
the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second
180 calendar day compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. 

If
we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance Date and is not eligible for an additional
compliance period at that time, the Staff will provide written notification to us that our common stock will be subject to delisting.
At that time, we may appeal the Staff s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. 

We
intend to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance
with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. There can be no assurance that we will regain compliance or otherwise maintain compliance
with any of the other listing requirements. 

In
the event that our common stock is delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market
or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established
for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of,
or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts
and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional
capital if we are not listed on a major exchange. 

Such
a delisting would also likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase
our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we may take actions to restore our compliance with The Nasdaq Capital
Market listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become
listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the
Bid Price Requirement or prevent future non-compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market listing requirements. 

Ongoing
litigation may result in substantial financial and operational impacts. 

We
are currently involved in litigation related to an alleged breach of contract, which is being pursued by BlueRadios, Inc. BlueRadios ).
This litigation could lead to a final judgment impacting our financial and operational results. A jury has already awarded 5.1 million
in damages as well as recommended 19.7 million in disgorgement and exemplary damages related to this matter. These damages have been
accrued, however the liability and or possible future payout could increase or decrease as a result of the final judgement issued by
the court. 

In
addition, on May 22, 2024, we filed a Motion for Judgement as a Matter of Law or in the alternative for a New Trial, as well as submissions
arguing that the disgorgement and exemplary damages should not be awarded. There is no guarantee that these will be granted. Furthermore,
on the same day, BlueRadios filed a motion seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting us from selling any products that incorporate BlueRadios 
trade secrets, along with requiring us to pay 10 million in pre-judgment interest and over 10 million in attorneys fees and
costs. Final briefing on the motions occurred on October 18, 2024. If the court rules in favor of BlueRadios on these motions, we may
face substantial additional damages beyond those already accrued. 

If
we choose to appeal, there is no assurance that such an appeal would be successful. An unfavorable outcome could significantly affect
our business operations and limit our ability to generate future revenues. 

Item
