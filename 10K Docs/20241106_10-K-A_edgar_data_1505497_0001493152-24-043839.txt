stockholder unless the combination or the transaction by which the person first became an interested stockholder is approved by the Board

and sixty percent of the corporation s voting power not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder, its affiliates and associates. 

Control
Share Acquisitions. The NRS also contains a control share acquisitions statute. If applicable to a Nevada corporation
this statute restricts the voting rights of certain stockholders referred to as acquiring persons, that acquire or offer
to acquire ownership of a controlling interest in the outstanding voting stock of an issuing corporation. 
For purposes of these provisions, a controlling interest means with certain exceptions the ownership of outstanding voting
stock sufficient to enable the acquiring person to exercise one-fifth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than
a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power in the election of directors; issuing corporation means a Nevada
corporation that has 200 or more stockholders of record, at least 100 of whom have addresses in Nevada appearing on the stock ledger
of the corporation at all times during the 90 days immediately preceding such date, and which does business in Nevada directly or through
an affiliated corporation. The voting rights of an acquiring person in the affected shares will be restored only if such restoration
is approved by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the corporation. The NRS allows a corporation to opt-out 
of the control share acquisitions statute by providing in such corporation s articles of incorporation or bylaws that the control
share acquisitions statute does not apply to the corporation or to an acquisition of a controlling interest specifically by types of
existing or future stockholders, whether or not identified. The Company has not opted out of this statute. 

Authorized
But Unissued Shares. Nevada law does not require stockholder approval for any issuance of authorized shares. Authorized but unissued
shares may be used for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public or private offerings to raise additional capital or to
facilitate corporate acquisitions. One of the effects of the existence of authorized but unissued shares may be to enable our Board of
Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, which issuance could render more difficult or discourage an attempt
to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of our management
and possibly deprive the stockholders of opportunities to sell their shares of common stock at prices higher than prevailing market prices. 

Preferred
Stock . Under the terms of our charter, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series
without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred
stock. The purpose of authorizing our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences is to provide
flexibility and eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issues. However, the ability of our Board of Directors
to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. 

Classified
Board. We have a classified Board of Directors consisting of three classes of directors. A classified board is one in which a certain
number, but not all, of the directors are elected on a rotating basis each year. This method of electing directors makes changes in the
composition of our Board more difficult, and thus a potential change in control may be a lengthier process. The existence of our classified
Board reduces the possibility that a third party could effect an unsolicited change in control of our Board. Since our classified Board
will increase the amount of time required for a takeover bidder to obtain control of us without the cooperation of the Board, even if
the takeover bidder were to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock, the existence of our classified Board could tend to discourage
certain tender offers which stockholders might feel would be in their best interests. Our classified Board will likely allow management,
if confronted by a proposal from a third party who has acquired a block of our common stock, sufficient time to review the proposal and
appropriate alternatives to the proposal and to attempt to negotiate a better transaction, if possible, for our stockholders. 

Special
Meetings of Stockholders. Our bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our Board of Directors or
the Chairman of the Board. 

Filling
Vacancies. Vacancies occurring in our Board of Directors and newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized
number of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum. 

Removal
of Directors by Stockholders. Under the terms of our charter, stockholders may remove directors with or without cause with the affirmative
vote of holders of 75 of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote at an election
of directors, voting together as a single class. 

Amendment
of Bylaws. Our bylaws may be amended by our Board of Directors or by the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our company. 

Amendment
of Certain Charter Provisions. Under the terms of our charter, amending certain charter provisions requires the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon,
voting together as a single class. The provisions subject to such heightened requirement include those relating to stockholder action
by written consent, the calling of special meetings, board classification, the filling of board vacancies, the removal of directors and
the ability to amend our bylaws, among others. 

Advance
Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals . Our bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to the nomination
of persons for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our Board of Directors, and stockholder proposals
for business. 

Stockholder
Nominees; Stockholder Proposals. 

In
order for a stockholder to nominate a candidate for director at, or bring any business before, an annual meeting of stockholders, under
our bylaws, timely notice of the nomination or business must be received by us in advance of the meeting. To be timely, a stockholder s
notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by our Secretary at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more
than 120 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date on which we first mailed the proxy materials for the preceding year s
annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if the meeting is convened more than 30 days prior to or delayed more than 60
days after the anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting, to be timely a stockholder s notice must be received not
earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business
on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual
meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of
the date of such meeting is first made by us. 

These
provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the Board and in policies formulated
by the Board and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control of our company.
These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited proposal for a takeover that does not contemplate the acquisition
of all of our outstanding shares or an unsolicited proposal for the restructuring or sale of all or part of our company.
