During the nine months ended September 30,
2024, the Company issued shares of its common stock to officers/directors/advisors of the Company for services, valued
at ; of which shares, valued at , was charged to operations during the year ended December 31, 2023. 

. Shortly after the Plaintiff
filed the lawsuit, BlackStar repaid the remaining principal balance. At the outset of the case, a temporary restraining order was
entered and required the transfer of shares of BlackStar s stock to the Plaintiff to be sold on the open market,
which occurred in Q1 and Q2 of 2024. BlackStar has appealed the temporary restraining order to the Nevada Supreme Court and seeks
the return of the , among other damages. While the appeal is pending, the Company, through its attorneys, filed an answer
to Plaintiff s complaint and counterclaims against Plaintiff on February 27, 2024. In addition to denying many of the allegations
laid out in the lawsuit, the Company invokes several affirmative defenses that bar Plaintiff s recovery in the action and
alleges that Plaintiff breached the terms of the agreement, including, but not limited to, obtaining the conversion of BlackStar s
stock after the Promissory Note was fully paid off. Amongst other claims, the Company alleges that the Plaintiff acted in bad faith
and in violation of usury laws by recovering an estimated dollars in BlackStar stock off of a promissory note,
estimated at a roughly interest rate. The Company seeks a judgment in its favor and against Plaintiff, compensatory damages
in an amount to be proven at trial, declaratory relief voiding the agreement as illegal under Section 29(b) of the Securities Act,
punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial, interest on all damages, and attorneys fees. As a result of the counterclaims,
there can be no reasonable estimate of any contingencies as of September 30, 2024. At an April 22, 2024 hearing, the Plaintiff s
motion to dismiss our counterclaims was denied, and again on July 18, 2024 the Court refused to dismiss BlackStar s counterclaims
against Plaintiff. BlackStar intends to pursue those counterclaims for securities violations. 

BlackStar and the Plaintiff have a agreed to
a stay of the trial court proceedings while the appeal of the temporary restraining order is resolved, likely in late 2025 or early
2026. 

At September 30, 2024, there were no legal proceedings against the
Company, other than the beforementioned. 

of debt owed to BlackStar s creditors
was approved in Florida State court in compliance with the terms of Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Under
the terms of the Settlement Agreement and Stipulation, CCI agreed to purchase the bona fide and outstanding and unpaid creditor
claims in exchange for shares of BlackStar s common stock. If satisfied in full, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the
Company will reduce the Company s debt obligations in exchange for the issuance of shares of Company s common stock
to CCI at a discount of off the market price (the lowest closing sale price for twenty (20) trading days), in one or more
tranches, pursuant to the terms of section 3(a)(l0) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company will issue 
freely trading shares to CCI pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act. 

The Company has analyzed its operations subsequent
to September 30, 2024 through the date that these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any
additional material subsequent events to disclose.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Forward-Looking Statements and Associated
Risks. 

This Form 10-Q contains certain statements
that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For this purpose, any statements
contained in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without
limiting the foregoing, words such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, 
 estimate, or continue or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
These statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially depending
on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. These factors include but are not limited to economic conditions
generally and in the industries in which we may participate; competition within our chosen industry, including competition from
much larger competitors; technological advances and failure to successfully develop business relationships. 

Based on our financial history since inception,
our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying
financial statements, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 11,529,344 and a working capital deficiency of
 2,568,410. This raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Overview 

BlackStar Enterprise Group, Inc. (the Company 
or BlackStar intends to act as a merchant bank as of the date of these financial statements. We currently trade
on the OTC Pink Sheets under the symbol BEGI . The Company is a merchant banking firm seeking to facilitate venture
capital to early-stage revenue companies. BlackStar intends to offer consulting and regulatory compliance services to blockchain
and DLT companies and blockchain entrepreneurs for securities, tax, and commodity issues. BlackStar is conducting ongoing
analysis for opportunities in involvement in electronic fungible share-related ventures though our wholly-owned subsidiary,
Blockchain Equity Management Corp., BEMC ), mainly in the areas of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies DLT ). BlackStar intends to serve businesses in their early corporate lifecycles and may provide funding in the forms
of ventures in which we control the venture until divestiture or spin-off by developing the businesses with capital. We have only
engaged in one transaction as a merchant bank form to date. 

Our investment strategy focuses primarily on
ventures with companies that we believe are poised to grow at above-average rates relative to other sectors of the U.S. economy,
which we refer to as emerging growth companies. Under no circumstances does the Company intend to become an
investment company and its activities and its financial statement ratios of assets and cash will be carefully monitored and other
activities reviewed by its Board of Directors to prevent being classified or inadvertently becoming an investment company which
would be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 

As a merchant bank, BlackStar intends to seek
to provide access to capital for companies and is specifically seeking out ventures involved in DLT or blockchain. BlackStar intends
to facilitate funding and management of DLT-involved companies through majority controlled joint ventures through its subsidiary
BEMC. BlackStar, through BEMC, intends to initially control and manage each venture. Potential ventures for both BlackStar
and BEMC will be analyzed using the combined business experience of its executives, with BEMC looking to fill those venture criteria
with companies in crypto-related businesses such as blockchain or DLT technologies. The Company does not intend to develop Investment
Objectives or criteria in any manner but will rely on the acumen and experience of its executives. BlackStar is currently
building a digital equity trading platform in order to trade registered BlackStar common shares in digital form (DWAC) and intends
to use the platform design to provide custom subscription services to other public companies. 

Recent Updates BlackStar s
progress in 2023 was focused on thoroughly planning and describing many aspects of our new proposed line of business of trading
common shares on a blockchain through the broker-dealer ecosystem. The Company is finalizing the marketing plan to promote and
roll out the three features of its blockchain platform. The Company plans to offer its Private Funding and Corporate Governance
Blockchain to individual private companies in 2024. The Company s next major step in its main feature, BlackStar s
Digital Trading Platform BDTP TM ), will be to engage an operating partner (a broker-dealer, clearing
firm, and/or registered Alternative Trading System ATS )) to host the platform prior to implementation. To that end,
the Company has been exploring partnerships with broker-dealers and existing ATS s and other 

15

strategies to go live with BDTP TM 
in accordance with existing laws and regulations. As of the date of this filing, the core platform of BDTP TM is complete
and will remain in the testing phase until we obtain an operating partner, or acquires a broker-dealer to operate the platform.
BlackStar intends to continue to seek further input from various regulatory agencies and others on the functionality of the BDTP
 TM . The BDTP TM has been completely designed in terms of the following components: data model, reports, web-based
user interface, blockchain interface, transaction logic, cloud interface, and functional demonstration app. The software is complete
in demonstrating a proof-of-concept trading ability, while recording activity using an immutable blockchain ledger. Currently,
the working model platform is hosted on Amazon s Quantum Ledger Database. During 2021, BlackStar and Artuova successfully
completed a production ready and feature-complete user interface for the digital platform which is now in the final stages of quality
assurance. In 2023, BlackStar and Artuova completed a production ready and feature-complete user interface for our Corporate Governance
feature on a blockchain. BlackStar is actively pursuing relationships with various broker-dealers, clearing firms, and ATS s
to complete the final stages, while considering applying for a Broker Dealer or ATS license. During 2021-2022, BlackStar filed
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office USPTO for patent protection of its proprietary software. During 2022,
BlackStar also filed with U.S. and foreign trademark offices for protection. On December 26, 2023, the USPTO issued Patent No.
US 11,854,080 B2, System And Method For Matching Orders And Immutable Blockchain Ledger For All Customer Trading Activity
With Settlement Into The Broker Dealer Ecosystem . In February 2024, BlackStar was allowed its Corporate Governance patent
 System and Method for Preparing for a SEC Financial Statement Audit by Recording Corporate Governance Information on an
Immutable Blockchain, which was subsequently issued on April 23, 2024. On May 6, 2024, the USPTO allowed BlackStar s
patent Systems And Methods For Using A Digital Trading Platform To Trade Securities On A Blockchain. 

The Company s success will be dependent
upon its ability to analyze and manage the opportunities presented and is contingent upon successfully raising funds and ultimately
SEC approval of our digital trading platform. 

Currently in the testing phase, we estimate
 100,000 to finalize the integration of the digital platform into the broker-dealer eco system. The ability to obtain a licensee
may be dependent on our ability to confirm that FINRA and the SEC will allow trading on our platform as described. If this is the
case, the Company may alternatively seek to acquire an existing broker-dealer in order to become a FINRA-registered broker-dealer.
Once we have secured a licensee broker-dealer, clearing firm, or ATS for the operations of the BDTP TM and begun operating
the BDTP TM , we will seek subscriber companies desiring customized platforms. At that point, we will have the ability
to showcase BDTP TM s live operations. The technical platform operations and updates will be managed by Artuova,
through our oversight and direction. The software building of additional platforms for subscriber companies may take as little
as 48 hours. We have not yet developed our marketing campaign to seek out these customers, but plan to do so after securing our
operating licensee, anticipated within the next twelve months. We anticipate our Corporate Governance platform to be subscribed
to by US corporations in 2024, with overall expansion of services into the blockchain industry within the next twelve months. 

Based on our current cash reserves of approximately
 2,179 as of September 30, 2024, we will need additional funding to sustain our operations. We intend to offer a private placement
of preferred shares to investors in order to achieve at least 5,000,000 in funding in the next year to scale our business plan.
We intend to commence this offering in the fourth quarter of 2024. If we are unable to generate enough revenue to cover
our operational costs, we will need to seek additional sources of funds. Currently, we have no committed source for any funds
as of date hereof. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the event funds cannot be raised
if and when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan and could fail in business as a result of these uncertainties. 

We have estimated 100,000 for the fourth quarter
of 2024 for operational costs which includes legal, accounting, travel, general and administrative, audit, rent, telephones and
miscellaneous. Thus far to date in 2024, we received an aggregate 239,000 in short term loans from investors, due with interest
at 11 per annum. 

The independent registered public accounting
firm s report on our financial statements as of December 31, 2023, includes a going concern explanatory paragraph
that describes substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2024, we had a working
capital deficit of 2,568,410 and cash of 2,179 as compared to a working capital deficit of 1,480,550 and cash of 33,550,
at December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and increase in working capital deficit was due primarily to the utilization of
available cash for operations and an increase in debt funding from 239,000 of loans received in the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. The Company used new and existing fundings to maintain operating activities and for legal matters. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 242,270 of cash for operating activities and paid 28,101 in investing
activities for software development costs. In the comparable 2023 period, operating activities utilized cash of 207,985 and
investing activities for software development costs utilized cash of 28,001. 

Substantially all of our funding in the 2024
and 2023 periods has been from note financings from non-related individuals. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we
borrowed 239,000, due with interest at 11 , and we issued 195,620,499 shares of common stock for debt extinguishment valued at
 11,737. During nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed 225,000 from non-related individuals, and convertible note holders
were issued 698,077,221 shares of common stock for conversion of 116,725 face value of debt and related accrued interest and fees. 

While management of the Company believes that
the Company will be successful in its current and planned activities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful
in obtaining sufficient revenues from our planned operations and raise sufficient equity, debt capital or strategic relationships
to sustain the operations and future business of the Company. 

Our ability to create sufficient working capital
to sustain us over the next twelve-month period, and beyond, is dependent on our raising additional equity or debt capital, and
ultimately to commence revenues form or digital trading platform. 

There can be no assurance that sufficient capital
will be available to us. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through
bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. 

Availability of Additional Capital 

Notwithstanding our previous success in fund
raising from notes and convertible debt financings there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in raising
capital and have adequate capital resources to fund our operations or that any additional funds will be available to us on favorable
terms or in amounts required by us. We estimate that we will need to raise 5,000,000 over the next twelve months to scale up our
current plan. The Company received 239,000 in debt financing to date in 2024. 

Any additional financing may be dilutive to
our stockholders, new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our shares
of common stock. Debt or equity financing may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. 

Going Concern 

We have only a very limited amount of cash
and have incurred operating losses and limited cash flows from operations since inception. As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, we had accumulated deficit of 11,529,344 and 10,421,950, respectively, and we will require additional working capital
to fund operations through 2024 and beyond. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our financial statements included in this Form 10-Q do not include any adjustments related to recoverability
and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable
to continue as a going concern. The audited financial statements included in the Company s recent annual report on Form 10-K
have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result if we
cease to continue as a going concern. 

Our former registered independent auditors
have issued an opinion on our financial statements as of December 31, 2023 which includes a statement describing our going concern
status. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless
we obtain additional capital to pay our bills and meet our other financial obligations. This is because we have not generated any
revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we 

18 

Table of Contents 

obtain final SEC approval for our digital trading
platform. There is no assurance that any revenue will be realized in the future. Accordingly, we must raise capital from sources
other than the actual revenue from issuance of memberships in our digital trading platform. 

There can be no assurance that we will have
adequate capital resources to fund planned operations or that any additional funds will be available to us when needed or at all,
or, if available, will be available on favorable terms or in amounts required by us. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital
resources to fund operations, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our operations, which may have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to operate as a going concern. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated
and communicated to management including our principal executive officer/principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management has carried out an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company s disclosure controls and procedures. Due to the lack of personnel
and outside directors, management acknowledges that there may be deficiencies in these controls and procedures, but Management
believes that the current procedures are not effective in disclosing all information required to be disclosed. The Company anticipates
that with further resources, the Company will expand both management and the board of directors with additional officers and independent
directors in order to provide sufficient disclosure controls and procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On November 6, 2023, we were notified of a
lawsuit filed in Clark County, NV against the Company by GS Capital Plaintiff regarding the unavailability of conversion
shares relating to the Promissory Note entered into on October 11, 2021 and the remaining principal balance of 33,682. The Plaintiff
is seeking specific performance for the reserve of 700,000,000 shares, or damages in excess of 15,000, plus interest, costs, and
legal fees. At the outset of the case, a temporary restraining order was entered preventing the Company from trading any shares.
As currently postured, Plaintiff seeks specific performance (a mandatory injunction) requiring the conversion of approximately
257,000,000 shares and possibly additional recovery of legal fees and interest. On February 27, 2024, the Company, through its attorneys,
filed an answer to Plaintiff s complaint and counterclaims against Plaintiff. In addition to denying many of the allegations
laid out in the lawsuit, the Company invokes several affirmative defenses that bar Plaintiff s recovery in the action and
alleges that 

19 

Table of Contents 

Plaintiff breached the terms of the agreement,
including, but not limited to, obtaining the conversion of BlackStar s stock after the Promissory Note was fully paid off.
Amongst other claims, the Company alleges that the Plaintiff acted in bad faith and in violation of usury laws by recovering an
estimated 600,000 in BlackStar stock off of a 60,000 promissory note, estimated at a roughly 170 interest rate. We seek a judgment
in our favor and against Plaintiff, compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, declaratory relief voiding the agreement
as illegal under Section 29(b) of the Securities Act, punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial, interest on all damages,
and attorneys fees. At an April 22, 2024 hearing, the Plaintiff s motion to dismiss our counterclaims was denied,
and again on July 18, 2024 the Court refused to dismiss BlackStar s counterclaims against Plaintiff. BlackStar intends to
pursue those counterclaims for securities violations. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

On January 25, 2024,
the Company entered into note agreements with two unrelated individuals as follows: 

100,000 from an unrelated individual, repayable one year from date
of the note with interest at 11 per annum; and agreed to issue as additional consideration to the lender 15,000,000 shares of

upon the exemption from securities registration for offers and sales to accredited investors afforded, inter alia, by Rule 506
under Regulation D as promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act, and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act. The Company intends to
use the funds to continue limited operations, including finding a broker-dealer and/or ATS to host the BDTP TM ,
legal and professional fees, consulting fees, and general and administrative expenses. 

14,000 from an unrelated individual, repayable 90 days from date
of the note with interest at 11 . At maturity the lender has the option to be issued, in lieu of cash payment of the outstanding
debt, 7,000 shares of the Company s common stock as full satisfaction of the principal loan amount and related unpaid and
accrued interest thereon. The Company and the holders executed the agreement in accordance with and in reliance upon the exemption
from securities registration for offers and sales to accredited investors afforded, inter alia, by Rule 506 under Regulation D
as promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act, and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act. The Company intends to use the funds to continue
limited operations, including finding a broker-dealer and/or ATS to host the BDTP TM , legal and professional fees,
consulting fees, and general and administrative expenses. 

In 2024, GS Capital filed
notices of conversion and were issued, in three tranches, 195,620,499 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of
 0.00006 per share on their note of October 11, 2021. (See Item 1. Legal Proceedings for additional information related
to GS Capital Partners). 

In February 2024, the
Company and each of the holders of two loans of 50,000 and 25,000 agreed to extend the maturity of the notes from February 2024
for a period of ten (10) months to December 2024 with interest continuing to be accrued at 11 . The Company agreed to issue 7,500,000
shares of common stock to the 50,000 note holder (valued at 12,000 0.0016 per share) and 3,750,000 shares of common stock to
the 25,000 note holder (valued at 7,125 0.0019 per share) as consideration for extending the notes. The Company valued the
shares to be issued based on the per share closing trading prices of the Company s common stock as of the date of extensions.
The Company and the holders executed the agreement in accordance with and in reliance upon the exemption from securities registration
for offers and sales to accredited investors afforded, inter alia, by Rule 506 under Regulation D as promulgated by the SEC under
the 1933 Act, and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act. The Company intends to use the funds to continue limited operations, including
finding a broker-dealer and/or ATS to host the BDTP TM , legal and professional fees, consulting fees, and general
and administrative expenses. 

In April 2024, the Company
borrowed 25,000 and 50,000 from each of two unrelated individuals, repayable one year from date of the notes with interest at
11 per annum. At maturity, the Company will repay the face amount of the loans in cash, including unpaid and accrued interest
at 11 and, in addition, has agreed to issue as additional consideration 3,750,000 and 7,500,000 shares of the Company s
common stock, respectively, to each of the lenders. At maturity the lenders have the 

20 

Table of Contents 

option to be issued,
in lieu of cash payment of the outstanding debts, an additional 3,750,000 and 7,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock,
respectively, as full satisfaction of the principal loan amounts and related unpaid and accrued interest thereon. The Company and
the holders executed the agreement in accordance with and in reliance upon the exemption from securities registration for offers
and sales to accredited investors afforded, inter alia, by Rule 506 under Regulation D as promulgated by the SEC under the 1933
Act, and/or Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act. The Company intends to use the funds to continue limited operations, including finding
a broker-dealer and/or ATS to host the BDTP TM , legal and professional fees, consulting fees, and general and administrative
expenses. 

In July 2024, the Company borrowed
 25,000 from each of two unrelated individuals (an aggregate 50,000), as follows: 

25,000 repayable nine months from date of the note with interest
at 11 per annum. At maturity, the Company will repay the face amount of the loan in cash, including unpaid and accrued interest
at 11 and, in addition, has agreed to issue as additional consideration 11,275,000 shares of the Company s common stock

11,275,000 shares of the Company s common stock as full satisfaction of the principal loan amounts and related unpaid and
accrued interest thereon. The Company recorded the value of shares to be issued to the lender for loan consideration as a discount
to debt, based on the closing trading price of the Company s common stock as of the date of the note, and is amortizing the
discount to interest expense over the term of the note. 

25,000 repayable three months from date of the note with interest
at 11 per annum. At maturity, the Company will repay the face amount of the loan in cash, including unpaid and accrued interest
at 11 , or has the option to be issued, in lieu of cash payment of the outstanding debts, 12,500,000 shares of the Company s
common stock as full satisfaction of the principal loan amounts and related unpaid and accrued interest thereon.

the agreement in accordance with and in reliance upon the exemption from securities registration for offers and sales to accredited
investors afforded, inter alia, by Rule 506 under Regulation D as promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act, and/or Section 4(a)(2)
of the 1933 Act. The Company intends to use the funds to continue limited operations, including finding a broker-dealer and/or
ATS to host the BDTP TM , legal and professional fees, consulting fees, and general and administrative expenses.

ITEM 5. 

The Company is aware that on January 23, 2024,
Aryeh Goldstein, Managing Member of SE Holdings, LLC, individually, and Adar Alef, LLC, also managed by Aryeh Goldstein, as the
entity, settled charges with the SEC ordering them, in part, to surrender for cancellation all remaining shares they obtained through
conversion of notes, as well as conversion rights under any remaining convertible notes. The Company is evaluating what this means
for the remaining outstanding conversion rights under the two convertible promissory notes held by SE Holdings, LLC 220,000)
and Adar Alef, LLC 550,000), and for the current holdings of Adar Alef, LLC (5,000,000 shares of common stock of BlackStar). 

On May 3, 2024, the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC entered an order instituting settled administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against BF
Borgers CPA PC and its sole audit partner Benjamin F. Borgers CPA (individually and together, BF Borgers ), the Company s
former public accountant. The Order denies BF Borgers the privilege of appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant.
As a result, on June 3, 2024, the Company retained a new public accountant, Fruci Associates II, PLLC, to review the financials
presented in this report, and will have the previous fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 reaudited by the new public accountant.

CERTIFICATION OF PERIODIC REPORT
