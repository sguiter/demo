 NOTES
TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR
THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 

 (Unaudited) 

shares of Common Stock
at a price of per share for approximately million in gross proceeds. After deducting the underwriting commission and other
offering expenses totaling million, the net proceeds to the Company were million. The Common Stock began trading on The Nasdaq
Capital Market on February 9, 2024 under the symbol TELO . 

million. The Company used approximately million of cash in operations
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Historically,
the Company has been primarily engaged in developing TELOMIR-1. During these activities, the Company has sustained substantial
losses. The Company s ability to fund ongoing operations and future clinical trials required for FDA approval is dependent on
the Company s ability to obtain significant additional external funding in the near and also over the long term. Since
inception, the Company has financed its operations through an initial public offering, related party financings and a private
financing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company secured a 
million line of credit from the Starwood Trust, a trust related to the Company s majority shareholder (see Note 4). Although
additional sources of financing may be sought by the Company, there can be no assurance that any fundraising will be achieved on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 

As
of the date of filing, the Company will continue to generate losses and have insufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand to support
its operations for at least the 12 months following the date the financial statements are issued. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through 12 months after the date the financial statements are
issued. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern 

royalty (payable quarterly)
on the Company s net sales of Licensed Products, as defined, by the Company or its sublicensees and on non-royalty bearing milestone
revenue. There are no up-front, execution, or milestone payments in the MIRALOGX License Agreement. Further, no payments have been made
to date under the agreement. 

The
term of the MIRALOGX License Agreement will continue through the date of the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent or, if
later, the date of the expiration of the last strategic partnership/sublicensing agreement covering the licensed products. The patent
rights are expected to extend through 2043, assuming patents are issued by the U.S Patent and Trademark Office, and additional patent
terms may be awarded, including additional patent terms based on the time taken for regulatory review of drug products. 

The
MIRALOGX License Agreement also provides that the Company may bring suit in its own name to enforce patent rights. However, MIRALOGX
will control the prosecution of the patent applications for TELOMIR-1. The Company is required to be kept informed by MIRALOGX of patent
prosecution activities and may select identified countries for patent protection. The Company is to reimburse MIRALOGX for patent prosecution
and maintenance costs. 

million. These advances are due on demand
and are non-interest bearing. 

Due
to related parties- 

During
the periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company received working capital advances from companies under
common control. These advances are due on demand and are non-interest bearing. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023,
advances in the amount of 
million were converted into 
shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate of 
per share resulting in a loss on the conversion of debt of million.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
million and 
million, respectively, advances remained outstanding. 

Shared
management- 

Historically,
the Company has shared management with related parties on an as-needed basis, to collaborate and pool resources efficiently. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred million in costs related to this arrangement which is recorded in general
and administrative expenses. As of September 30, 2024, the Company no longer expects to share management with related parties on an as-needed
basis. 

Bay
Shore Trust Line of Credit - 

On
June 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Promissory Note and Loan Agreement (the Bay Shore Note with Bay Shore Trust.
Under the Bay Shore Note, the Company had the right to borrow up to an aggregate of million from the Bay Shore Trust at any time up
to the second anniversary of the issuance of the Bay Shore Note or, if earlier, upon the completion of the IPO. The Company s right
to borrow funds under the Bay Shore Note was subject to the absence of a material adverse change in its assets, operations, or prospects.
The Bay Shore Note, together with accrued interest, was to become due and payable on the second anniversary of the issuance of the note,
and allowed prepayment of the note at any time without penalty. The Bay Shore Note accrued interest at a rate equal per annum, simple interest, during
the first year that the note was outstanding and per annum, simple interest, thereafter. The Bay Shore Note was unsecured. 

In
consideration of the Bay Shore Note, the Company issued to the Bay Shore Trust a Common Stock purchase warrant on June 15, 2023 giving the Bay
Shore Trust the right to purchase up to shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of per share, and such warrant will
expire five years after the date of grant. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement, the Company has granted to Bay Shore Trust the
right to require the Company, at any time after one year following the IPO, to register for resale the shares issuable upon the exercise
of the warrant, with such registration rights being in the form of demand and piggyback registration rights that are subject
to customary limitations and restrictions. As of September 30, 2024, these shares have been registered for resale. Upon issuance, the
warrant met the criteria to be classified as equity based on an analysis under Accounting Standards Codification (480) ASC 480, Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity and was measured at fair value, resulting in an initial fair value of approximately million upon
issuance of the warrant, using Black-Scholes valuation techniques. 

The
borrowings from Bay Shore Trust were paid in full during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and the Company has fully amortized the
relating financing costs and future borrowings are no longer available due to the terms of the agreement, specifically the closing of
the IPO, which occurred on February 13, 2024. 

Starwood
Trust Line of Credit- 

On
September 24, 2024 the Company entered into an unsecured Promissory Note and Loan Agreement the Starwood Note with the
Starwood Trust, a separate related party trust established by the Company s founder for the benefit of the founder s family.
Under the Starwood Note, the Company has the right to borrow up to an aggregate of million from the Starwood Trust at any time up
until the second anniversary of the note. The Company s right to borrow funds under the Starwood Note is subject to the absence
of a material adverse change in its assets, operations, or prospects. The Starwood Note, together with accrued interest, is to become
due and payable on the second anniversary of the issuance of the note, provides for prepayment at any time without penalty, and accrues simple
interest at a rate equal per annum. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not borrowed any amounts under the Starwood Note. 

Related
Party Travel Costs- 

On
April 1, 2023 the Company entered into an Agreement For Shared Lease Costs (the Shared Agreement with MIRALOGX, a related
party. Under the Shared Agreement, the Company agrees to make monthly contributions or payments in accordance with its use of shared
aircraft toward rent payments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company incurred million
and million, respectively, for travel-related expenses to MIRALOGX for rental charges and airplane-related expenses. The Company
will not participate in the use of the MIRALOGX airplane after March of 2024 and, pursuant to the terms of the Shared Agreement, has
no further obligation under the Shared Agreement.

Company has granted warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock. Warrants may be granted to affiliates in connection with certain agreements. 

As

and outstanding. There were no warrants exercised during the nine months ended September 30,2024. 

Underwriter
warrants 

In
connection with the IPO, the Company issued warrants to purchase Common Stock to the IPO underwriter (or its designees) at an
exercise price of which expire after a four-and-a-half-year period commencing six months after the commencement of sales in the
IPO. The warrants will be exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the four-and-a-half-year period
commencing six months after the commencement of sales in the IPO. 

Stock-based
compensation 

The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses assumptions for expected
volatility, expected dividends, expected term, and the risk-free interest rate. Expected price volatility is based on the historical
volatilities of a peer group as the Company does not have a multi-year trading history for its shares. Industry peers consist of several
public companies in the biotech industry similar to the Company in size, stage of life cycle and product indications. The Company intends
to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information
regarding the volatility of the Company s own stock price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified
companies are no longer similar to the Company, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would
be utilized in the calculation. 

Expected
term of options granted is derived using the simplified method which computes expected term as the average of the sum of
the vesting term plus contract term. The risk-free rate is based on the 5-year U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a total of options to purchase Common Stock, with an aggregate fair market value
of approximately million were granted to the members of the Company s Board of Directors, executive officers, employees and
consultants of the Company. The options have an exercise price of , a term of years from the grant date, and vest over various
terms ranging from immediate vesting upon grant to the second anniversary of the grant date.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company s
actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a
result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth herein and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in the Company s
other filings with the SEC. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements below. 

As
used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, unless otherwise indicated,
the terms the Company , we , us , our and similar terminology refer to Telomir Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. 

Background
of the Company 

We
are a pre-clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of TELOMIR-1, a novel small molecule
being developed to lengthen the DNA s protective telomere caps, potentially promoting longevity in humans and canine animals by
treating age-related conditions. Telomeres, the protective end caps of chromosomes composed of DNA sequences and proteins, naturally
shorten as humans age. This shortening is accelerated by metal reactivity, which increases the risk of degenerative and age-related diseases. 

Our
goal is to advance the clinical development of TELOMIR-1 in the United States for the treatment of age-related inflammatory conditions
and commercialize Telomir-1, proposed to be dosed orally, with the broader aim of promoting longevity and enhancing overall quality of
life. 

To
date, we have not generated any revenue nor do we expect to generate revenue unless and until we successfully complete preclinical and
clinical development of, receive regulatory approval for, and commercialize a program and we do not know when, or if at all, that will
occur. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical
activities and studies and initiate clinical trials. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any programs, we expect to incur
significant expenses related to production of sales, marketing, and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing and distribution
are not the responsibility of potential collaborators. We expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. 

Our
operating expenses have historically been the costs associated with our initial investment in pre-clinical research and development activities.
We expect research and development expenses will increase in the future as we advance TELOMIR-1 into and through clinical trials and
pursue regulatory approvals, which will require a significant investment in costs of clinical trials, regulatory support, and contract
manufacturing. In addition, we will evaluate opportunities to acquire or in-license additional product candidates and technologies, which
may result in higher research and development expenses due to license fee and/or milestone payments, as well as added clinical development
costs. 

We
had net losses of 13.6 million and 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Components
of Our Results of Operations 

Research
and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research and development of our product candidate. We recognize all research
and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of the following: 

contracted
 research and manufacturing; 

consulting
 arrangements; and 

other
 expenses incurred to advance the Company s research and development activities. 

Our
operating expenses have historically been the costs associated with our initial investment in pre-clinical research and development activities.
We expect research and development expenses will increase in the future as we advance TELOMIR-1 into and through clinical trials and
pursue regulatory approvals, which will require a significant investment in costs of clinical trials, regulatory support, and contract
manufacturing. In addition, we will evaluate opportunities to acquire or in-license additional product candidates and technologies, which
may result in higher research and development expenses due to license fee and/or milestone payments, as well as added clinical development
costs. 

The
process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We may never succeed in timely
development and achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. The probability of success of our product candidates may be
affected by numerous factors, including clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. As a result, we
are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue
from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.

which were primarily related to toxicology studies, pre-clinical research projects and related manufacturing for pre-clinical research
projects. We incurred 1.4 million in research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, relating to
initial payments for toxicology studies and consulting arrangements. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct
research and development of our product candidate and consist primarily of contracted pre-clinical research and manufacturing, toxicology,
consulting arrangements and other expenses incurred to advance the Company s research and development activities. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . We incurred 7.0 million and 0.2 million in general and administrative expenses during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily due to payroll costs for management and consultants
that began after the IPO and were not incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the Company granted stock options
in August 2024 to employees totaling approximately 4.8 million. General and administrative expenses consist of expenses paid in connection
with administrative functions, as well as fees paid for legal, consulting fees and facilities costs not otherwise included in research
and development expenses. Legal costs include general corporate legal fees and license costs. 

Related
Party Travel Costs . We incurred 0.4 million and 1.3 million in related party travel costs during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Related party travel costs consisted of a lease and use of an airplane with MIRALOGX,
an entity under common control with us. We will not participate in the use of the MIRALOGX airplane after March of 2024 and, pursuant
to the terms of our agreement with MIRALOGX related to this matter, will not have any further obligation under the agreement. 

Interest
expense, net . We incurred 4.3 and 0.9 million in interest expense, net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September
30, 2023, respectively. The 2024 interest expense consists of the amortization of the deferred financing costs on warrants issued in
connection with the related party line of credit as disclosed in Note 5 to the accompanying condensed financial statements. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 

Research
and Development Expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 0.6 million in research and development
expenses, which were primarily related to toxicology studies, pre-clinical research projects and related manufacturing for pre-clinical
research projects. We incurred 0.3 million in research and development expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2023, relating
to initial payments for toxicology studies and consulting arrangements. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to
conduct research and development of our product candidate and consist primarily of contracted pre-clinical research and manufacturing,
toxicology, consulting arrangements and other expenses incurred to advance the Company s research and development activities. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . We incurred 5.3 million and 0.1 million in general and administrative expenses during the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily due to payroll costs for management
and consultants that began upon the IPO and were not incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the
Company granted stock options in August 2024 to employees totaling approximately 4.8 million. General and administrative expenses
consist of administrative functions, as well as fees paid for legal and consulting fees and facilities costs not otherwise included
in research and development expenses. Legal costs include general corporate legal fees and license costs. We expect to incur
additional expenses as a result of becoming a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and
regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, additional insurance, investor relations and other administrative expenses and professional
services. 

14 

Related
Party Travel Costs. We incurred 0.6 million in related party travel costs during the three months ended September 30, 2023. There
was no such expense incurred during the same period ended September 30, 2024. Related party travel costs consisted of a lease and use
of an airplane with MIRALOGX, an entity under common control with us. We will not participate in
the use of the MIRALOGX airplane after March of 2024 and, pursuant to the terms of our agreement with MIRALOGX related to this matter,
will not have any further obligation under the agreement. 

Interest
income (expense) . We earned 0.02 million in interest income during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and incurred 0.8 million
in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2024
is primarily related to interest earned from money market account. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately 0.8 million. We used approximately 4.5 million of cash in operations during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Historically,
we have been primarily engaged in developing TELOMIR-1. During these activities, we have sustained substantial losses. We have incurred
net losses of 13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which 7 million was attributable to general and administrative
expenses, Since inception, we have financed its operations through an initial public offering, related party financings and a private
financing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we secured 5 million in additional funding pursuant to the Starwood Note
(see Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements). Based on current projections, we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents
as of the date of this report to support our operations for at least the 12 months following the date that the financial statements are
issued. Accordingly, substantial doubt exists with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued. 

Our
ability to fund ongoing operations and future clinical trials required for FDA approval is dependent on our ability to obtain significant
additional external funding in the near term. Although, additional sources of financing may be sought by us, there can be no assurance
that any fundraising will be achieved on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The failure to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable
terms when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, we
have concluded that substantial doubt exists with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued. 

Sources
of Liquidity 

Since
our inception in August 2021, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from our initial public offering that occurred
in February of 2024, an unsecured line of credit with the Bay Shore Trust, our majority shareholder, and through a 1.0 million private
placement of shares of our Common Stock that occurred during the first quarter 2023 at 3.73 per share (after giving effect to our 1-for-2.05
reverse stock split that occurred on December 11, 2023). We intend to finance our clinical development programs and working capital needs
from existing cash and potential new sources of debt and equity financing. Further, we plan to conduct a raise of capital in the near
future to assist in financing working capital needs. 

On
September 24, 2024 we entered into an unsecured Promissory Note and Loan Agreement with the Starwood Trust, a separate trust which was
established by our founder for the benefit of his family. Under this Promissory Note and Loan Agreement (the Starwood Note ),
we have the right to borrow up to an aggregate of 5 million from the Starwood Trust at any time up until the second anniversary of the
note. Our right to borrow funds under the Starwood Note is subject to the absence of a material adverse change in its assets, operations,
or prospects. The Starwood Note, together with accrued interest, is to become due and payable on the second anniversary of the issuance
of the note, and provides for prepayment at any time without penalty. The Starwood Note accrues interest at a rate equal of 7 per annum, simple
interest. 

We
have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expect to incur additional losses until
such time that we can generate significant revenue and profit, which we do not expect to occur in the near future. We had negative cash
flow from operations of approximately 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash
and cash equivalents of approximately 0.8 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 27.7 million. 

15 

We
currently expect that our cash and cash equivalents, when taking into account the net proceeds of 5.8 million from our initial public
offering and potential advances from the Starwood Note, will not be sufficient to fund our operations, development plans, and capital
expenditures through the third quarter of 2025 without additional financing. As such, there is substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern.

related parties, offset by 0.2 million net in related party borrowings and payments. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and therefore are not required to provide the information
under this item per Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K. 

16 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial
officer) (the Certifying Officers ), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal accounting officers, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. The Certifying Officers have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Report,
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure
control system were met. Management is in the process of implementing plans to remediate the ineffectiveness of its disclosure
controls and procedures through enhancements to its internal control environment as more fully described below. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
2024, we designed and implemented new and enhanced controls to strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting, including hiring
additional experienced accounting personnel, among other enhancements. Management believes these enhancements will be sufficient to remediate
previously identified material weaknesses. However, the new and enhanced controls have not operated for a sufficient amount of time to
conclude that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Other
than as described above, there were no additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f)
of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

the timing of anticipated regulatory filings; 

the timing of availability of data from our clinical trials; 

our future expenses, capital requirements, need for additional financing, and the period over which we believe that the net proceeds
from our initial public offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses
and capital expenditure requirements; 

our ability to retain the continued service of our key professionals and to identify, hire and retain additional qualified professionals; 

our
ability to advance product candidates into, and successfully complete, clinical trials; 

our ability to recruit and enroll suitable patients in our clinical trials; 

the timing or likelihood of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, and other product development objectives;

31, 2023. 

Given
the risks and uncertainties set forth in this quarterly report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report are not guarantees of future performance and our actual
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially
from the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition

report, they may not be predictive of results or developments in future periods. 

18 

Any
forward-looking statement that we make in this quarterly report speaks only as of the date of such statement. Except as required by federal
securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise, or to publicly announce any update or revision to, any of the
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this quarterly report. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may be named in claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Currently, no legal proceedings, government actions,
administrative actions, investigations, or claims are pending against us or involve us that, in the opinion of our management, could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to, and could be materially adversely affected by, various
risks and uncertainties. These risks are more fully disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results, and also
include the following risks. 

We
expect to rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including
failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or failing to comply with regulatory requirements or our pre-clinical protocols. 

We
currently rely on third-party contract research organizations CROs to conduct our pre-clinical trials, as we currently
do not plan to independently conduct pre-clinical trials of any of our product candidates. Our agreements with these CROs, and other
third parties might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties to such agreements. If we
were ever to need to enter into alternative arrangements or if we were to need to change a CRO for an ongoing pre-clinical trial, we
might experience delays in our pre-clinical development activities. 

Geopolitical
events and global economic conditions, such as the Israel-Hamas war may impact the third parties that we engage to supply materials or
manufacture any products for our preclinical tests and clinical trials, which increases the risk of potential delay of development efforts,
as applicable. 

If
the third parties that we engage to supply any materials or manufacture any products for our preclinical tests and clinical trials should
cease to continue to do so for any reason, including due to the effects of global economic conditions, including the Hamas-Israel war,
we likely would experience delays in advancing these tests and trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers or manufacturers,
as applicable, and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able
to obtain adequate supplies of our product, or the substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our
product, and compete effectively. 

Our
current and anticipated dependence upon third-party suppliers may adversely affect our ability to develop our product and product candidates,
and could delay our clinical trials and development programs as well as affect our marketing and commercialization efforts. In addition,
such dependence may increase our costs and expenses, and may otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. 

19 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On
February 13, 2024, the Company closed its IPO consisting of 1,000,000 shares at a price of 7.00 per share for approximately 7.0 million
in gross proceeds. After deducting the underwriting commission and other offering expenses totaling 1.2 million, the net proceeds to
the Company was 5.8 million. None of the underwriting discounts and commissions or other offering expenses were incurred or paid, directly
or indirectly, to any of our directors or officers or their associates or to persons owning 10 or more of our Common Stock or to any
of our affiliates. 

The
shares were offered and sold pursuant to the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-275534), originally
filed with the SEC on November 14, 2023 (the Registration Statement and the final quarterly report filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Registration
Statement was declared effective by the Commission on February 8, 2024. The Common Stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on
February 9, 2024 under the symbol TELO . The closing of the IPO occurred on February 13, 2024.
