Overview 

Our
Business 

We
are a manufacturer of non-toxic deep cycle lithium-ion batteries that are designed to displace lead acid batteries in a number of different
storage applications and end markets including recreational vehicle RV ), marine vessel, and solar, oil and gas
and off-grid industries, with disruptive solid-state cell technology currently under development. 

Since
2020, we have sold over 320,000 batteries. For the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, we sold 10,283 and 14,886
batteries, respectively, and had 12.7 million and 15.9 million in net sales, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and September 30, 2023, we sold 32,907 and 56,183 batteries, respectively, and had 38.4 million and 54.0 million in net sales,
respectively. We currently offer a line of batteries across our Battle Born and Dragonfly brands, each differentiated
by size, power and capacity, consisting of seven different models, four of which come with a heated option. We primarily sell Battle
Born branded batteries directly to consumers DTC and Dragonfly branded batteries to original
equipment manufacturers OEMs ). 

Our
decrease in sales is a reflection of weaker demand from both OEM and DTC customers in our core RV and marine markets due to rising interest
rates and inflation. Our RV OEM customers currently include Keystone, THOR, Airstream, and REV, and we are in ongoing discussions with
a number of additional RV OEMs to further increase adoption of our products. Related efforts include seeking to have RV OEMs design
in our batteries as original equipment and entering into arrangements with members of the various OEM dealer networks to stock. 

We
currently source the lithium iron phosphate LFP cells incorporated into our batteries from a limited number of
carefully selected suppliers that can meet our demanding quality standards and with whom we have developed long-term relationships. 

In
May 2024, we announced that we achieved full certification for our energy storage products to be deployed for use in oil gas
operations in North America. As a result of this certification, we are working Connexa Energy Company Connexa to deliver a power product to Alegacy Equipment, LLC Alegacy Equipment ), a market leading natural gas
compressor package company, and its affiliate Agnes Systems. The power systems, which Connexa expects to integrate, are expected to
be used in natural gas compression equipment to reduce methane emissions in gas pipelines. We expect the first of these systems to
be deployed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and this business line to begin contributing to net sales during the fourth quarter of
2024. 

To
supplement our battery offerings, we are also a reseller of accessories for battery systems. These include chargers, inverters, monitors,
controllers and other system accessories from brands such as Victron Energy, Progressive Dynamics, Magnum Energy and Sterling Power.
Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated April 22, 2022 by and among us and Thomason Jones Company, LLC Thomason Jones and the other parties thereto, we also acquired the assets, including the Wakespeed Offshore brand Wakespeed of
Thomason Jones, allowing us to include our own alternator regulator in systems that we sell. 

In
addition, we have successfully developed innovative manufacturing processes for dry-electrode manufacturing of lithium-ion cells, and
continue development efforts relating to next-generation solid-state technology. Since our inception, we have built a comprehensive patent
portfolio around our proprietary dry-electrode battery manufacturing process, which eliminates the use of harmful solvents and energy-intensive
drying ovens compared to traditional methods. This translates to significant environmental and cost benefits, including reduced energy
consumption, smaller space requirements, and a lower carbon footprint. 

Moreover,
our solid-state technology in development removes the need for a liquid electrolyte, thereby addressing safety concerns related to flammability.
Our unique competitive edge lies in the combination of solid-state technology with its scalable dry-electrode manufacturing process.
This enables the rapid production of cells having an intercalation anode (like graphite or silicon), unlike many competitors reliant
on less stable lithium metal anodes. We believe this design offers superior cyclability and safety, serving as a key differentiator in
the energy storage market. Furthermore, internal production of both conventional and solid-state cells streamlines our supply chain and
enables vertical integration, ultimately driving down production costs. In October 2023, we announced the successful dry deposition of
anode and cathode electrodes at scale using our patented battery manufacturing process. We are currently producing sample cells for prospective
customers across a variety of chemistries and end-markets and expect to begin scaling production during 2025. In addition, we are currently exploring opportunities within North America
as part of our efforts to build a cell manufacturing facility. 

39 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash totaling 8.0 million. Our net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 6.8 million and
our net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was 10.0 million. As a result of becoming a publicly traded company, we continue
to need to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary
practices. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors 
and officers liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting and legal and administrative resources,
including increased audit and legal fees. As discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources below, we expect that
we will need to raise additional funds, including through the use of our 150 million equity facility (the ChEF Equity Facility with Chardan Capital Markets LLC CCM LLC and the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or by obtaining
additional credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, ongoing costs, such as research
and development relating to our solid-state batteries, expansion of our facilities, and new strategic investments. If such financings
are not available, or if the terms of such financings are less desirable than we expect, we may be forced to take actions to reduce our
capital or operating expenditures, including not seeking potential acquisition opportunities, eliminating redundancies, or reducing or
delaying our production facility expansions, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. 

License
Agreement with Stryten 

On
July 29, 2024, Legacy Dragonfly and Battle Born Battery Products, LLC Battle Born LLC ), a newly formed wholly-owned

ensures the ready availability of batteries for shipment on new trucks and allows for their inclusion in the tractor s purchase
price. 

On June 18, 2024, we announced we entered into a partnership with Meyer Distributing, Inc. Meyer Distributing ),
a leading distributor of specialty products across North America. We expect to leverage Meyer Distributing s distribution network
to deliver Battle Born Batteries to new business-to-business customers in the RV and surrounding industries. 

Trucking Market Milestones 

On
August 12, 2024, we announced that we would be partnering with Highway Transport, a leader in North American liquid chemical transportation,
to transition Highway Transport s entire fleet of over 500 trucks to our Battle Born all-electric APUs. As part of the partnership,
Highway Transport is expected to install the Battle Born all-electric APUs on new tractors in addition to retrofitting current models
in Highway Transport s fleet. This partnership with Highway Transport marks a major step forward for our reach in the commercial
trucking sector. We believe the planned integration of the Battle Born all-electric APU into Highway Transport s fleet paves the
way for wider adoption of our clean energy solutions, accelerating the transition towards a more sustainable transportation landscape. 

On
July 1, 2024, we announced that we are now a provider of lithium based liftgate power solutions for Refreshment Services Pepsi, a privately-held
independent bottler and distributor for Pepsi-Cola products. With distribution centers across the U.S., Refreshment Services Pepsi
will begin integrating our Battle Born Batteries products into their fleet to power liftgate operations. The expansion of our lithium-based
power solutions to liftgate applications broadens sales opportunities within the trucking market. 

Recent Developments 

In October 2024, we completed a demonstration of our
first off-grid methane reclamation payer system in collaboration with Alegacy Equipment and Anges Systems for the oil and gas industry. 

On October 14, 2024, we introduced Dragonfly
IntelLigence to the heavy-duty trucking market. This patent-pending smart battery technology provides fleets and truck drivers
access to real-time system monitoring and app-based connectivity. We believe Dragonfly IntelLigence provides additional value to our
Battle Born all-electric APUs by delivering enhanced visibility over our battery system. 

On November 13, 2024, we announced we had entered into a partnership with
Keystone Automotive Operations, Inc. Keystone Automotive ), a leading distributor and marketer of specialty automotive
equipment and accessories in North America, for the distribution of Battle Born Batteries products. This partnership is expected to increase
the availability of Battle Born Batteries products by leveraging Keystone Automotive s extensive distribution network. 

Key
Factors Affecting Our Operating Results 

Our
financial position and results of operations depend to a significant extent on the following factors: 

End
Market Consumers 

The
demand for our products ultimately depends on demand from consumers in our current end markets. We generate sales through (1) DTC and
(2) through OEMs, particularly in the RV market. 

An
increasing proportion of our sales has been and is expected to continue to be derived from sales to RV OEMs, driven by continued efforts
to develop and expand sales to RV OEMs with whom we have longstanding relationships. Our RV OEM sales have been on a purchase order basis,
without firm revenue commitments, and we expect that this will likely continue to be the case. Therefore, future RV OEM sales will be
subject to risks and uncertainties, including the number of RVs these OEMs manufacture and sell, which in turn may be driven by the expectations
these OEMs have around end market consumer demand. 

Demand
from end market consumers is impacted by a number of factors, including fuel costs and energy demands (including an increasing trend
towards the use of green energy), as well as overall macro-economic conditions, such as interest rates and inflation. Sales of our batteries
have benefited from the increased adoption of the RV lifestyle, the demand for and inclusion of additional appliances and electronics
in RVs, and the accelerating trend of solar power adoption among RV customers. However, rising fuel costs and other macro-economic conditions
have caused a downward shift in decisions taken by end market consumers around spending in the RV market and in July 2023, we were notified
by our largest RV OEM customer that, due to weaker demand for its products and their subsequent focus on reducing costs, it would no
longer install our storage solutions as standard equipment, but rather return to offering those solutions as an option to dealers and
consumers. While this customer is not moving to a different solution or competitor, as a result in this change in strategy there was
a material limiting effect on our revenue in 2023. Based on our ongoing discussions with customers and current forecast projections,
we remain cautiously optimistic about increased revenue potential in the RV market. While the DTC segment shows continued uncertainty
amid broader market conditions, we have noted progress in the OEM market, where daily revenue rates have been increasing in the third
quarter of 2024. However, seasonality factors associated with the holiday period in the fourth quarter of 2024 may limit gross revenue,
even as OEM demand trends positively. 

While
a significant portion of our sales come from the RV market, we also offer targeted solutions using the same products for the marine market.
These solutions cater to OEMs and consumers alike, addressing the power needs of various vessels like sailboats, powerboats, and fishing
boats (center console and bass). We have worked closely to follow ABYC (American Boat Yacht Council) Standards to develop systems
that adhere to the recent ABYC E-13 Guidelines (Standards for Lithium Batteries). We have also begun generating sales in the trucking market in the third quarter of 2024. 

42 

Our
strategy includes plans to expand into other end markets that we have identified as opportunities for our LFP batteries, including medium
and heavy-duty trucking, specialty and work vehicles, solar integration, oil and gas, industrial, rail, material handling, and emergency
and standby power in the medium term, and data centers, telecom and distributed on-grid storage in the longer term. We believe that our
current LFP batteries and, eventually, our solid-state batteries, will be well-suited to supplant traditional lead-acid batteries as
a reliable power source for the variety of low power density uses required in these markets (such as powering the increasing number of
on-board tools needed in emergency vehicles). The success of this strategy requires (1) continued growth of these addressable markets
in line with our expectations and (2) our ability to successfully enter these markets. We expect to incur significant marketing costs
understanding these new markets, and researching and targeting customers in these end markets, which may not result in sales. If we fail
to execute on this growth strategy in accordance with our expectations, our sales growth would be limited to the growth of existing products
and existing end markets. 

Supply 

We
currently rely on two carefully selected cell manufacturers located in China, and a single supplier, also located in China, to manufacture
our proprietary battery management system, and we intend to continue to rely on these suppliers going forward. Our close working relationships
with our China-based LFP cell suppliers, reflected in our ability to increase our purchase order volumes (qualifying us for related volume-based
discounts) and order and receive delivery of cells in anticipation of required demand, has helped us moderate increased supply-related
costs associated with inflation, currency fluctuations and U.S. government tariffs imposed on our imported battery cells and to avoid
potential shipment delays. To mitigate against potential adverse production events, we opted to build our inventory of key components,
such as battery cells. However, as many of the supply chain challenges and delays that were prevalent over the last several years have
eased, we are now actively working down our inventory to more appropriate safety stock levels. 

As
a result of our battery chemistry and active steps we have taken to manage our inventory levels, we have not been subject to the shortages
or price impacts that have been present for manufacturers of nickel manganese cobalt and nickel cobalt aluminum batteries. As we look
toward the production of our solid-state cells, we have signed a Commercial Offtake Agreement with a lithium mining company located in
Nevada for the supply of lithium, which we expect will enable us to further manage our cost of goods over time. 

Product
and Customer Mix 

Our
product sales consist of sales of seven different models of LFP batteries, along with accessories for battery systems (individually or
bundled). These products are sold to different customer types (e.g., consumers, OEMs and distributors) and at different prices and involve
varying levels of costs. In any particular period, changes in the mix and volume of particular products sold and the prices of those
products relative to other products will impact our average selling price and our cost of goods sold. Despite our work to moderate increased
supply-related costs, the price of our products may also increase as a result of increases in the cost of components due to inflation,
currency fluctuations and tariffs. OEM sales typically result in lower average selling prices and related margins, which could result
in margin erosion, negatively impact our growth or require us to raise our prices. However, this reduction is typically offset by the
benefits of increased sales volumes. Sales of third-party sourced accessories typically have lower related margin. We expect accessory
sales to increase as we further develop full-system design expertise and product offerings and consumers increasingly demand more sophisticated
systems, rather than simple drop-in replacements. In addition to the impacts attributable to the general sales mix across our products
and accessories, our results of operations are impacted by the relative margins of products sold. As we continue to introduce new products
at varying price points, our overall gross margin may vary from period to period as a result of changes in product and customer mix. 

43 

Production
Capacity 

All
of our battery assembly currently takes place at our 99,000 square foot headquarters and manufacturing facility located in Reno, Nevada.
We currently operate three LFP battery production lines. Consistent with our operating history, we plan to continue to automate additional
aspects of our battery production lines. Our existing facility has the capacity to add up to four additional LFP battery production lines
and construct and operate a pilot production line for domestic cell manufacturing, all designed to maximize the capacity of our manufacturing
facility. Although our automation efforts are expected to reduce our costs of goods, we may not fully recognize the anticipated savings
when planned and could experience additional costs or disruptions to our production activities. 

In
addition, we entered into a lease on February 8, 2022 for an additional 390,240 square foot warehouse in Reno, Nevada (the Reno
Warehouse ). The commencement date for the lease for the Reno Warehouse was March 25, 2024, based on the construction project
being identified as substantially complete . The Reno Warehouse will enable us to consolidate various operations in Reno,
NV and will allow for expected expansion for new markets. We expect to begin operations in the Reno Warehouse in the fourth quarter of
2024 with the consolidation of operations expected to occur in the second quarter of 2025. 

On
April 12, 2024, we entered into a lease agreement (the Fernley Lease Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to lease
an approximately 64,000 square foot facility (the Premises in Fernley, Nevada, to be used for general, warehousing,
assembly/light manufacturing, painting of products, storage fulfillment, distribution of our products, and other uses as permitted under
in the Fernley Lease Agreement. 

Competition 

We
compete with traditional lead-acid battery manufacturers and lithium-ion battery manufacturers, who primarily either import their products
or components or manufacture products under a private label. As we continue to expand into new markets, develop new products and move
towards production of our solid-state cells, we will experience competition with a wider range of companies. These competitors may have
greater resources than we do, and may be able to devote greater resources to the development of their current and future technologies.
Our competitors may be able to source materials and components at lower costs, which may require us to evaluate measures to reduce our
own costs, lower the price of our products or increase sales volumes in order to maintain our expected levels of profitability. 

Research
and Development 

Our
research and development is primarily focused on the advanced manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries using a dry-electrode process. We
are focused on scaling the process to allow for the low-cost domestic manufacturing of cells. We are also applying the dry-electrode
process to the production of solid-state lithium-ion batteries having an LFP catholyte, a solid electrolyte and an intercalation-based
anolyte (intercalation being the reversible inclusion of a molecule or ion into layered solids). The next stage in our technical development
is to construct the battery to optimize performance and longevity to meet and exceed industry standards for our target storage markets.
Ongoing testing and optimizing of more complicated batteries incorporating layered pouch cells will assist us in determining the optimal
cell chemistry to enhance conductivity and increase the number of cycles (charge and discharge) in the cell lifecycle. This is expected
to require significant additional expense, and we may need to raise additional funds to continue these research and development efforts. 

Components
of Results of Operations 

Net
Sales 

Net
sales are primarily generated from the sale of our LFP batteries to OEMs and consumers, as well as chargers and other accessories, either
individually or bundled. 

Cost

average selling prices, product costs, product mix and customer mix. 

44 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and development 

Research
and development costs include personnel-related expenses for scientists, experienced engineers and technicians as well as the material
and supplies to support the development of new products and our solid-state technology. As we work towards completing the development
of our solid-state lithium-ion cells and the manufacturing of batteries that incorporate this technology, we anticipate that research
and development expenses will increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in product development and optimizing
and producing solid-state cells. 

General
and administrative 

General
and administrative costs include personnel-related expenses attributable to our executive, finance, human resources, and information
technology organizations, certain facility costs, and fees for professional services. 

Selling
and marketing 

Selling
and marketing costs include outbound freight, personnel-related expenses, as well as trade show, industry event, marketing, customer
support, and other indirect costs. We expect to continue to make the necessary sales and marketing investments to enable the execution
of our strategy, which includes expanding into additional end markets. 

Total
Other Income (Expense) 

Other
income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense, the change in fair value of the warrant liability and amortization of debt issuance
costs.

Net
Sales 

Net
sales decreased by 3.2 million, or 19.9 , to 12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 15.9 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower DTC battery sales offset by higher OEM battery,
accessory sales and licensing revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, DTC revenue decreased by 5.1 million to 5.2 million,
compared to 10.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 due to decreased customer demand for our products, rising interest rates, and
inflation. OEM revenue increased by 1.8 million to 7.4 million, compared to 5.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. We believe this
increase may be attributable to a recovering RV market, the implementation of our smart battery technology product line, and us beginning to penetrate the heavy-duty trucking market. Licensing revenue
was recognized in August and September in the amount of 0.2 million. We expect our deployment of products for use in oil and gas operations
in North America to begin contributing to net sales during the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of revenue decreased by 1.4 million, or 12.8 , to 9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower unit volume. We expect our Cost of Goods Sold
to increase in conjunction with the anticipated increase in revenue over the next twelve months. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit decreased by 1.7 million, or 37.6 , to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4.6 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a lower unit volume of sales. Gross
margin decreased by 6.4 from 28.9 to 22.5 , which is a result of higher lower margin OEM sales and lower higher margin DTC sales. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses increased by 0.2 million, or 17.8 , to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher wage expense in the amount of
 0.2 million and 0.2 million for increased lease expense for new lease offset by lower patent expense in the amount of 0.1 million
and lower materials and supplies. While we expect to continue to grow the Research and Development headcount, we expect to do so at a
slower rate than in prior years. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses decreased by 1.6 million, or 27.4 , to 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to employee-related costs in the amount
of 1.3 million. Impacting this is a higher stock-based compensation in the amount of 0.7 million both in the prior year along with
lower employee-related costs in the amount of 0.6 million due to decreased headcount. Professional services, legal, insurance expenses
and travel are lower by 1.1 million. Offsetting these lower costs is an increase in computer expense related to the Reno Warehouse in
the amount of 0.1 million and rent expense in the amount of 0.7 million for the Reno Warehouse, which was mostly allocated to general
and administrative expenses since we have not occupied the building as of September 30, 2024. We expect General and Administrative Expenses,
as a percentage of revenue, to decline over the next twelve months. 

46 

Selling
and Marketing Expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses decreased by 0.2 million, or 5.8 , to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is mostly related to lower shipping costs of 0.2 million,
which was related to a reduction in units sold. We expect our Selling and Marketing Expenses to be relatively stable over the next twelve
months. 

Total
Other (Expense) Income 

Other
expense totaled 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to total other expense of 4.1 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense of 0.8 million in three months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised primarily
of interest expense of 5.6 million related to our debt securities and a positive change in fair market value of warrant liability in
the amount of 4.9 million. The 4.1 million of other expense in three months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised 4.0 million in
interest expense related to our debt securities and a negative change in fair market value of warrant liability of 0.1 million. 

Income
Tax (Benefit) Expense 

There
was no tax expense recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 or the three months ended September 30, 2023. Based on available
evidence as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, management believes it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we established a 100 valuation allowance. As a result of the full valuation allowance,
we did not record a tax benefit during the three months ended September 30, 2023 or the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net
Loss 

We
experienced a net loss of 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net loss of 10.0 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. As described above, this result was driven by lower sales partially offset by lower cost of goods
sold, and lower operating expenses, and a decrease in other income (due to the change in fair market value of our warrants). 

Comparisons

Net
Sales 

Net
sales decreased by 15.5 million, or 28.8 , to 38.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 54.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to lower DTC and OEM battery and accessory sales offset by
a higher average sales price and licensing revenue recognized at 0.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, DTC revenue
decreased by 13.4 million to 16.9 million due to decreased customer demand for our products related to rising interest rates and inflation.
OEM revenue decreased by 2.3 million to 21.4 million primarily due to our largest RV customer changing our product from a standard
offering to an option. Excluding this customer our RV OEM sales were up 33 year over year for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
We expect our deployment of products for use in oil and gas operations in North America to begin contributing to net sales during the
fourth quarter of 2024. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of revenue decreased by 11.4 million, or 28.0 , to 29.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 40.8
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower unit volume resulting in a 10.9 million
decrease of product cost and 0.5 million decrease in labor expense associated with lower headcount. We
expect our Cost of Goods Sold to increase in conjunction with the anticipated increase in revenue over the next twelve months. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit decreased by 4.1 million, or 31.1 , to 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 13.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a lower unit volume of sales. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses increased by 1.2 million, or 34.9 , to 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher wage expense in the amount of
 0.8 million and 0.3 million for increased lease expense for new building in Fernley. Depreciation related to an increase in assets,
which was higher by 0.1 million. While we expect to continue to grow the Research and Development headcount, we expect to do so at a
slower rate than in prior years. 

48 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses decreased by 8.2 million, or 35.6 , to 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 23.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower employee related costs in the
amount of 7.3 million. Impacting this is a prior year severance package in the amount of 0.7 million and lower stock-based compensation
in the amount of 4.8 million along with lower employee related costs in the amount of 1.8 million due to decreased headcount. Professional
services, legal and insurance expenses are lower by 2.1 million as a result of prior year public offering expenses and lower insurance
premiums. Travel expenses in General and Administrative decreased by 0.5 million due to allocation to the other functional areas in
2024. Offsetting these lower expenses is a 1.7 million increase in rent expense for the Reno Warehouse, which was mostly allocated to
general and administrative expenses since we have not occupied the building as of September 30, 2024. We expect General and Administrative
Expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to decline over the next twelve months. 

Selling
and Marketing Expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses decreased by 2.8 million, or 24.8 , to 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 2.3 million decrease in wage-related
expenses of which 1.2 million is related to the prior year expense for the Wakespeed earnout and 1.0 million is due to lower stock
compensation and bonus expense. Lower shipping costs in the amount of 0.9 million was related to a reduction in units sold. Offsetting
these lower expenses is an increase of 0.4 million other marketing expense includes travel expenses allocated from general and administrative
to selling and marketing in 2024. 

Total
Other Income (Expense) 

Other
expense totaled 12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to total other income of 7.2 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised of a positive change in
fair market value of our warrants in the amount of 3.1 million and 15.3 million in interest expense related to our debt securities.
Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of a positive change in fair market value of our warrants in
the amount of 19.2 million partially offset by 12.0 million in interest expense related to our debt securities. 

Income
Tax (Benefit) Expense 

There
was no tax expense recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Based on available
evidence as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, management believes it is more likely than not that some or all the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we established a 100 valuation allowance. As a result of the full valuation allowance,
we did not record a tax benefit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
Loss 

We
generated a net loss of 30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net loss of 17.1 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was a result of an increase in other expense (primarily as a result of a change in fair market
value of our warrants) and lower sales offset by decreased cost of goods sold and lower operating expenses. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial
statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
On a recurring basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. The effects
of material revisions in an estimate, if any, will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date
of the change in the estimate. 

We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from
period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Management
has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our board of directors.
In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above.
Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. 

49 

We
believe that the following accounting estimates are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
financial statements. 

Inventory
Valuation 

We
periodically review physical inventory for excess, obsolete, and potentially impaired items and reserves. Any such inventory is written
down to net realizable value. The reserve estimate for excess and obsolete inventory is dependent on expected future use and requires
management judgement. The level of the estimate is assessed by considering the recent sales experience, the aging of inventories, and
other factors that affect inventory obsolescence. 

Warrants 

We
apply relevant accounting guidance for warrants to purchase our stock based on the nature of the relationship with the counterparty.
For warrants issued to investors or lenders in exchange for cash or other financial assets, we follow guidance issued within ASC 480,
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ), and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ),
to assist in the determination of whether the warrants should be classified as liabilities or equity. Warrants that are determined to
require liability classifications are measured at fair value upon issuance and are subsequently remeasured to their then fair value at
each subsequent reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings. Warrants that are determined to require equity
classifications are measured at fair value upon issuance and are not subsequently remeasured unless they are required to be reclassified.
See Note 9-Warrants in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for information on the warrants. 

Equity-Based
Compensation 

We
use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of option grants. In estimating fair value, management is required
to make certain assumptions and estimates such as the expected life of units, volatility of our future share price, risk-free rates,
future dividend yields and estimated forfeitures at the initial grant date. Restricted stock units RSUs awards
are valued based on the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant. Changes in assumptions used to estimate fair
value could result in materially different results. 

Income
Taxes 

We
account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

We
recognize the financial statement effect of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical
merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that
is greater than 50 likely to be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount, which
in the opinion of management is more likely than not to be realized. 

Management
judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance
recorded against our deferred tax assets. We consider factors such as the cumulative income or loss in recent years; reversal of deferred
tax liabilities; projected future taxable income exclusive of temporary differences; the character of the income tax asset, including
income tax positions; tax planning strategies and the period over which we expect the deferred tax assets to be recovered in the determination
of the valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust our estimates in the future, we
may need to adjust our valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. 

Leases 

Acquired
right-of-use assets and assumed lease liabilities are measured based on the remaining lease payments over the remaining portion of the
lease term. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, our incremental borrowing rate is used as a discount rate in determining the
present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate was determined by comparing current low- and high-end mortgage loan rates
and calculating an average. For our new Damonte lease, to be conservative in our estimate, we chose to use the high-end average as our
incremental borrowing rate . 

License
Arrangement 

We
have entered into license arrangements that involve receiving upfront compensation, which is recognized as revenue over a five-year period.
Management estimates the appropriate recognition pattern based on the expected delivery of related services and the period over which
the economic benefits will be realized. This estimate involves judgments about the timing of performance obligations and the likelihood
of continued customer engagement. Changes in these assumptions or unexpected developments could result in adjustments to revenue recognition,
impacting the financial statements. As of the reporting date, management believes the estimate reflects the current understanding of
the license arrangement s performance obligations.

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

This
Quarterly Report includes a non-generally accepted account principles within the United States U.S. GAAP measure
that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Earnings before interest tax and amortization EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other income (expenses), income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA
is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, employee separation expenses, costs associated with the June 2023 Offering,
promissory note forgiveness, and change in the fair market value of warrant liabilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that
we believe is useful to investors and analysts because it illustrates the underlying financial and business trends relating to our core,
recurring results of operations and enhances comparability between periods. 

Adjusted
EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and is not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as
calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within
the same industry. Investors should exercise caution in comparing our non-GAAP measure to any similarly titled measure used by other
companies. This non-GAAP measure excludes certain items required by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to information
reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

The
table below presents our adjusted EBITDA, reconciled to net (loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and
September 30, 2023.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including
working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, contractual obligations and other commitments. We assess liquidity in terms of our
cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash
totaling 8.0 million. 

On
July 29, 2024, Legacy Dragonfly and Battle Born LLC entered into the License with Stryten. In exchange for the licensing rights, Stryten
agreed to pay Battle Born LLC the Initial Licensing Fee of five million dollars 5,000,000). Per the License Agreement, payment for
the Initial Licensing Fee is due within 30 days of the effective date of the License Agreement. We received the Initial Licensing Fee
in August 2024. 

We
expect our capital expenditures and working capital requirements to increase materially in the near future, as we continue our research
and development efforts (particularly those related to lithium-ion cell manufacturing and battery development), expand our production
lines, scale up production operations and look to enter into adjacent markets for our batteries. We expect to deploy a significant amount
of capital to continue our development and optimization of our solid-state battery technology, as well as continued investment to automate
and increase the production capacity of our existing assembly operation, expansion of our facilities and new strategic investments, including
deployment and scaling of our dry-electrode cell manufacturing processes. To date, our focus has been on seeking to prove the fundamental
soundness of our manufacturing techniques and our solid-state chemistry. Moving forward, our solid-state related investments will focus
on chemistry optimization and establishing a pilot line for pouch cell production. Over the next two to three years, we expect to spend
in excess of 50 million on solid-state development and cell manufacturing technologies. In connection with the contraction of our business
and uncertainty around the timing of future needs, we reduced our purchase activities in 2024. As a result, our inventory balance at
September 30, 2024 decreased by 14.8 million to 24.0 million, compared to 38.8 million at December 31, 2023. 

We
expect that we will need to raise additional funds, including through the use of the ChEF Equity Facility and the issuance of equity,
equity-related or debt securities or by obtaining additional credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal
sources of liquidity, ongoing costs, such as research and development relating to our solid-state batteries, expansion of our facilities,
and new strategic investments, and strategic initiatives. If such financings are not available, or if the terms of such financings are
less desirable than we expect, we may be forced to take actions to reduce our capital or operating expenditures, including by not seeking
potential acquisition opportunities, eliminating redundancies, or reducing or delaying our production facility expansions, which may
adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Further, any future debt or equity financings may
be dilutive to our current stockholders.

Financing
Obligations and Requirements 

On
November 24, 2021, we issued 45 million of fixed rate senior notes, secured by among other things, a security interest in our intellectual
property. As part of the Business Combination, we entered into a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of
 75 million (the Term Loan pursuant to the Term Loan, Guarantee and Security Agreement (the Original
Term Loan Agreement by and among, us, Legacy Dragonfly, Alter Domus (US) LLC, as the Agent to the lenders time-to-time party
thereto (such lenders, the Term Loan Lenders ), the proceeds of which were used to repay the 45 million fixed rate
senior notes, and ChEF Equity Facility. On June 28, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment with the Term Loan Lenders. The First Amendment
provided for a one-time issuance of the June 2024 Penny Warrants to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of common stock and certain amendments
to the Term Loan. On July 29, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment with the Term Loan Lenders in connection with the License Agreement.
On September 30, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment with the Term Loan Lenders, which provided for the issuance of the September
2024 Penny Warrants to purchase up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock and certain amendments to the Term Loan Agreement. 

In
connection with the License Agreement, on July 29, 2024, us, Legacy Dragonfly and Battle Born LLC entered into the Second Amendment (together
with the Original Term Loan, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, and the Third Amendment, the Term Loan Agreement ). 

Pursuant
to the Second Amendment, the Term Loan Lenders (i) consented to the transactions contemplated by the License Agreement and the Trademark
Transfer Agreement and (ii) agreed to waive the mandatory prepayment under the Term Loan that would have been due to the Term Loan Lenders
under the Term Loan Agreement upon Battle Born LLC s receipt of the Initial Licensing Fee. In connection with the Second Amendment,
Battle Born LLC entered into the Joinder. 

The
Term Loan proceeds were used to: (i) support the Business Combination, (ii) prepay the fixed rate senior notes at closing of the Business
Combination, (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing, (iv) to provide additional growth capital and (v) for other
general/corporate purposes. The Term Loan will mature on October 7, 2026, or the Maturity Date, and will be subject to quarterly amortization
of 5 per annum beginning 24 months after issuance. The definitive documents for the Term Loan incorporate certain mandatory prepayment
events and certain affirmative and negative covenants and exceptions hereto. The financial covenants for the Term Loan include a maximum
senior leverage ratio covenant, a minimum liquidity covenant, a springing fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, and a maximum capital
expenditures covenant. On March 29, 2023, September 29, 2023, December 29, 2023, May 13, 2024, June 28, 2024, and September 30, 2024,
we obtained waivers from Alter Domus (US) LLC, as the administrative agent for the lenders (the Administrative Agent and EICF Agent LLC and certain third-party financing source of our failure to satisfy the Tests under the Term Loan during the quarters
ended March 31, 2023, September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024. On March 31, 2024,
April 29, 2024, June 28, 2024, July 31, 2024, August 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, and October 31, 2024 we received additional waivers
from the Administrative Agent and the Term Loan Lenders in regard to our compliance with the liquidity requirement under the Term Loan
as of the last day of the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024, and as of the last fiscal day
for the months ended April 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, July 31, 2024, August 31, 2024, September 30, 2024, and October 31, 2024. However,
it is probable that we will fail to meet these covenants within the next twelve months. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we reclassified
our notes payable from a long-term liability to a current liability. The Term Loan accrues interest as follows: (i) until April 1, 2024,
at a per annum rate equal to adjusted secured overnight financing rate SOFR plus 7 payable in cash plus an amount
ranging from 4.5 to 6.5 , depending on our senior leverage ratio; (ii) effective April 1, 2024 and thereafter, interest payable to certain
lenders subject to regulations of the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA with outstanding principal on that
date of 30,846 will be limited to 14.0 per annum (except for default interest permitted under SBA regulations, as applicable); and
(iii) the other outstanding principal will accrue interest from April 1, 2024 thereafter until October 1, 2024, at a per annum rate equal
to adjusted SOFR plus 7 payable in cash plus an amount ranging from 4.5 to 6.5 , depending on the senior leverage ratio of the consolidated
company, and at all times thereafter, at a per annum rate equal to adjusted SOFR plus a margin ranging from 11.5 to 13.5 , depending
on our senior leverage ratio. 

Payments
of interest based on the Term Loan are as follows: 

(i)
Interest payable on April 1, 2024, was paid in cash. 

(ii)
Interest payable on July 1, 2024, became payable-in-kind. 

(iii)
Interest payable on October 1, 2024, became payable partly in cash and partly in-kind, at a per annum rate equal to adjusted SOFR plus
7 payable in cash plus an amount ranging from 4.5 to 6.5 paid-in-kind, depending on the senior leverage ratio of the consolidated
company (subject to the 14.0 limit for lenders subject to SBA regulations). 

(iv)
For each payment date occurring on or after January 1, 2025, interest will be payable in cash. 

53 

In
each of the foregoing cases, adjusted SOFR will be no less than 1 . 

We
may elect to prepay all or any portion of the amounts owed prior to the Maturity Date, provided that we provide notice to the Administrative
Agent and the amount is accompanied by the applicable prepayment premium, if any. Prepayments of the Term Loan are required to be accompanied
by a premium of 5 of the principal amount so prepaid if made prior to the October 7, 2023, 3 if made on and after October 7, 2023 but
prior to October 7, 2024, 1 if made after October 7, 2024 but prior to October 7, 2025, and 0 if made on or after October 7, 2025.
If the Term Loan is accelerated following the occurrence of an event of default, Legacy Dragonfly is required to immediately pay to lenders
the sum of all obligations for principal, accrued interest, and the applicable prepayment premium. 

Pursuant
to the Term Loan Agreement, we have guaranteed the obligations of Legacy Dragonfly and such obligations will be guaranteed by any of
Legacy Dragonfly s subsidiaries that are party thereto from time to time as guarantors. Also pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement,
the Administrative Agent was granted a security interest in substantially all of the personal property, rights and assets of us as and
Legacy Dragonfly to secure the payment of all amounts owed to lenders under the Term Loan Agreement. In addition, we entered into a Pledge
Agreement pursuant to which we pledged to the Administrative Agent our equity interests in Legacy Dragonfly as further collateral security
for the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement. At the closing of the Business Combination, we issued to the Term Loan Lenders (i)
the Penny Warrants exercisable to purchase an aggregate of 2,593,056 shares at an exercise price of 0.01 per share, and (ii) warrants
exercisable to purchase 1,600,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 10.00 per share. 

Pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, on the terms of and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in the Purchase Agreement, including the
filing and effectiveness of a registration statement registering the resale by CCM LLC of the shares of common stock issued to it under
the Purchase Agreement, we will have the right from time to time at our option to direct CCM LLC to purchase up to a specified maximum
amount of shares of common stock, up to a maximum aggregate purchase price of 150 million over the term of the ChEF Equity Facility.
The purchase price of the shares of common stock that we elect to sell to CCM LLC pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will be determined
by reference to the VWAP of the common stock during the applicable VWAP Purchase Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) on which
we have timely delivered written notice to CCM LLC directing it to purchase shares of common stock under the Purchase Agreement, less
a fixed 3.5 discount to such VWAP. As consideration for its commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement,
we have agreed to pay a commitment fee of 1 million to CCM LLC (the Commitment Fee ), payable by way of an additional
3.0 discount to such VWAP until the Commitment Fee has been paid in full. In connection with the ChEF Equity Facility, we filed a registration
statement registering the resale of up to 21,512,027 shares that may be resold into the public markets by CCM LLC, which represented
approximately 36 of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued and sold
approximately 588,500 shares of our common stock under this facility, resulting in net cash proceeds of 1,278,566. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, we issued and sold approximately 2,245,391 shares of our common stock under the ChEF Equity Facility, resulting
in net cash proceeds of 1,705,193. From October 1, 2024 through the November 12, 2024, we issued and sold approximately 53,719 shares
of our common stock under the ChEF Equity Facility, resulting in additional net cash proceeds of 26,660. Any sales of such shares into
the public market could have a significant negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. This impact may be heightened by
the fact that sales to CCM LLC will generally be at prices below the current trading price of our common stock. If the trading price
of our common stock does not recover or experiences a further decline, sales of shares of common stock to CCM LLC pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement may be a less attractive source of capital and/or may not allow us to raise capital at rates that would be possible if the
trading price of our common stock were higher. 

54 

On
March 5, 2023, we issued a note in the principal amount of 1.0 million (the Principal Amount to Brian Nelson,
one of our directors, in a private placement in exchange for cash in an equal amount (the March Note ). The March
Note became due and payable in full on April 1, 2023. We were also obligated to pay a fee in the amount of 100,000 (the March
Loan Fee to Mr. Nelson on April 4, 2023. The Principal Amount of the March Note was paid in full on April 1, 2023 and the
March Loan Fee was paid in full on April 4, 2023. 

On
January 30, 2024, we issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the January Note in the principal amount
of 1.0 million (the January Principal Amount to Brian Nelson, one of our directors, in a private placement in
exchange for cash in an equal amount. The January Note became due and payable in full on February 2, 2024. We were also obligated to
pay 50,000 (the January Loan Fee to Mr. Nelson on February 2, 2024. We paid the January Principal Amount and the
January Loan Fee in full on February 2, 2024. 

On
February 27, 2024 we issued a convertible promissory (the February Note in the amount of 1.7 million (the February
Principal Amount to Mr. Nelson, in a private placement in exchange for cash in an equal amount. The February Note became
due and payable in full on March 1, 2024. We were also obligated to pay a 85,000 loan fee (the February Loan Fee to Mr. Nelson on March 1, 2024. We paid the February Principal Amount and the February Loan Fee on March 1, 2024. 

In
June 2023, we completed the June 2023 Offering which provided net proceeds to us, including the partial over-allotment option exercise,
of approximately 20.7 million. In July 2023, upon a request from our Term Loan Lenders under the Term Loan Agreement, we repaid 5.3
million to satisfy a portion of our outstanding principal. 

In
2024, we identified an underpayment of tariffs to U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP in the amount of approximately
 1.66 million in the aggregate, related to the improper classification and valuation of certain of the products used in our batteries.
We have reported the underpayment to CBP. 

Going
Concern 

For
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we generated a net loss of 6.8 million and had a negative cash flow from operations. As of September
30, 2024, we had approximately 8.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital deficit of 9.6 million. 

Under
the Term Loan Agreement, we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants, which include maintaining a maximum senior leverage
ratio, minimum liquidity, a springing fixed charge coverage ratio, and maximum capital expenditures. On March 29, 2023, September 29,
2023, December 29, 2023, May 13, 2024, June 28, 2024, July 31, 2024, August 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, we obtained waivers from
our Administrative Agent and the Term Loan Lenders in regards to our failure to satisfy the Tests with respect to the minimum cash requirements
under the Term Loan for the quarters ended, March 31, 2023, September 30, 2023, December 31, 2024, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and
September 30, 2024. On March 31, 2024, April 29, 2024, June 28, 2024, July 31, 2024, August 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, and October
31, 2024, we received additional waivers from our Administrative Agent and the Term Loan Lenders in regards to our compliance with the
liquidity requirement under the Term Loan as of the last day of the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September
30, 2024 and as of the last day of the fiscal months ended April 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, July 31, 2024, August 31, 2024, September 30,
2024, and October 31, 2024. In connection with the License Agreement, on July 29, 2024, us, Legacy Dragonfly and Battle Born LLC entered
into the Second Amendment. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Term Loan Lenders (i) consented to the transactions contemplated by
the License Agreement and the Trademark Transfer Agreement and (ii) agreed to waive the mandatory prepayment under the Loan Agreement
that would have been due to the Lenders under the Term Loan upon Battle Born LLC s receipt of the Initial Licensing Fee. In connection
with the Second Amendment, Battle Born LLC entered into the Joinder. It is probable that we will fail to meet these covenants within
the next twelve months. If we are unable to comply with the financial covenants in our loan agreement, the Term Loan Lenders have the
right to accelerate the maturity of the Term Loan. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. 

In
addition, we will need to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to fund our operations and strategic plans and meet our
financial covenants. We have historically been able to raise additional capital through issuance of equity and/or debt financing and
we intend to use the ChEF Equity Facility and raise additional capital as needed. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able
to raise additional equity, contain expenses, or increase revenue, and comply with the financial covenants under the Term Loan. If
such financings are not available, or if the terms of such financings are less desirable than we expect, we may be forced to take
actions to reduce our capital or operating expenditures, including by not seeking potential acquisition opportunities, eliminating
redundancies, or reducing or delaying our production facility expansions, which may adversely affect our business, operating
results, financial condition and prospects. Further, future debt or equity financings may be dilutive to our current
stockholders.

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a net loss of 30.8
million partially offset by 4.8 million in deferred revenue related to the License Agreement, 6.6 million of payment in-kind interest
accrued on the Term Loan and 14.8 million decrease in inventory as a result of management s decision to lower overall stocking
levels to adjust for more modest demand. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 16.7 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a net loss of 17.1 million
and an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by lower inventory levels. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in investing
activities of 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily
due to a decrease in capital equipment expenses. 

Financing
Activities 

There
was 1.7 million net cash provided in financing activities, primarily from proceeds of issuing and selling shares under ChEF Equity Facility
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 18.7 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to net proceeds of 21.1 million from the June 2023 Offering partially offset by a
 5.3 million principal payment of our notes payable. 

Contractual
Obligations 

Our
estimated future obligations consist of short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.9 million
in short-term operating lease liabilities and 23.3 million in long-term operating lease liabilities. 

As
disclosed above, we have a Term Loan and as of September 30, 2024, the principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan was 69.7 million.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as our principal
executive officer, and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as our principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

56 

In
connection with the preparation of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management
necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As described in our
Annual Report, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as a result of our failure
to capture, and record, and pay tariffs correctly related to the imported merchandise on previously filed 2022 and 2021 financial statements.
Based upon the evaluation described above, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that, due to the
material weakness previously reported in our Annual Report that has not yet been remediated, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
described a plan to remediate the material weakness within our Annual Report. Management, with the assistance of a third-party service
provider, continues to design and implement additional internal controls. Additionally, management continued its risk assessment to identify
risks and objectives. There were no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter
ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. Management will continue to evaluate and enhance our processes as noted in the remediation plan described within our Annual
Report. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these will ultimately
have the intended effects. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal
proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome,
litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

Term Loan Lenders in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions of the Penny Warrants with respect to certain sales we made under
the ChEF Equity Facility. In addition, October 1, 2024 to November 12, 2024 we issued certain Penny Warrants to purchase 419 shares
of common of common stock to the Term Loan Lenders in accordance with the anti-dilution provisions of the Penny Warrants with
respect to certain sales we made under the ChEF Equity Facility. The Penny Warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance and
will expire ten years from the date of issuance. The Penny Warrants and the shares of common stock underlying the Penny Warrants
