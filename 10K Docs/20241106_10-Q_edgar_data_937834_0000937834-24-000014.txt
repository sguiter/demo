segments to reflect changes in management s responsibilities: Group Benefits, RIS and MetLife Holdings. The Group Benefits and RIS businesses were previously reported as the U.S. segment. These changes were applied retrospectively and did not have an impact on prior period total consolidated net income (loss) or adjusted earnings. In addition, the Company continues to report certain of its results of operations in Corporate Other. 
 Group Benefits 
 The Group Benefits segment, based in the U.S., offers a broad range of products to corporations and their respective employees, other institutions and their respective members, as well as individuals. These products include term, variable and universal life insurance, dental, group and individual disability and accident health insurance. 
 RIS 
 The RIS segment, based in the U.S., offers a broad range of life and annuity-based insurance and investment products to corporations and their respective employees, other institutions and their respective members, as well as individuals. These products include stable value and pension risk transfer products, institutional income annuities, structured settlements, benefit funding solutions and capital markets investment products. 
 MetLife Holdings 
 The MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses that the Company no longer actively markets in the U.S. These include variable, universal, term and whole life insurance, variable, fixed and index-linked annuities and long-term care insurance. 
 Corporate Other 
 Corporate Other contains various start-up, developing and run-off businesses, including the Company s ancillary non-U.S. operations. Also included in Corporate Other are: the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments (including enterprise-wide strategic initiatives), interest expense related to the majority of the Company s outstanding debt, expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit issues, and the elimination of intersegment amounts (which generally relate to intersegment loans bearing interest rates commensurate with related borrowings). 
 Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies 
 Adjusted earnings is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is also the Company s GAAP measure of segment performance and is reported below. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). The Company believes the presentation of adjusted earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. 
 Adjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax. 
 These financial measures focus on the Company s primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of (i) market volatility which could distort trends, (ii) asymmetrical and non-economic accounting, and (iii) revenues and costs related to divested businesses, non-core products and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations under GAAP. 
 Market volatility can have a significant impact on the Company s financial results. Adjusted earnings excludes net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), market risk benefits MRBs remeasurement gains (losses) and goodwill impairments. Further, policyholder benefits and claims exclude (i) changes in the discount rate on certain annuitization guarantees accounted for as additional liabilities, and (ii) market value adjustments.

million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net effect of actual variances from expected experience was largely offset by the corresponding impact in DPL associated with the RIS segment s annuity products of million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net effect of actual variances from expected experience was primarily driven by favorable mortality and the amendment of an affiliated reinsurance treaty. 
 Significant Methodologies and Assumptions 
 The principal inputs used in the establishment of the FPB for the RIS segment s annuity products include actual premiums, actual benefits, in-force data, locked-in claim-related expense, the locked-in interest accretion rate, the current upper-medium grade discount rate at the balance sheet date and best estimate mortality assumptions. 
 When single premium annuity contracts are issued, the FPB reserve is required to be measured at an upper-medium grade discount rate. Due to differences between the upper-medium grade discount rate and pricing assumptions used to determine the contractual premium, the initial FPB reserve at issue for a particular cohort may be greater than the contractual premium received, and the difference must be recognized as an immediate loss at issue. On these cohorts, future experience that differs from expected experience and changes in cash flow assumptions result in the recognition of remeasurement gains and losses with net remeasurement gains limited to the amount of the original loss at issue, after which any favorable experience is deferred and recorded within the DPL. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a net remeasurement gain related to the net effect of changes in cash flow assumptions.

 (1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net effect of changes in cash flow assumptions was primarily driven by updates in policyholder behavior assumptions related to claim utilization experience, which lowered the expected cost of care. This was partially offset by updates in morbidity assumptions associated with an increase in incidence rates.

 Significant Methodologies and Assumptions 
 The Company issues GMDBs, GMWBs, guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits GMABs and GMIBs that typically meet the definition of MRBs, which are measured in aggregate, as one compound MRB, at estimated fair value separately from the variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net income, except for changes in nonperformance risk of the Company which are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) OCI ). 
 The Company calculates the fair value of these MRBs, which is estimated as the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected attributed fees, using actuarial and capital market assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. The calculation is based on in-force business, projecting future cash flows from the MRB over multiple risk neutral stochastic scenarios using observable risk-free rates.

 Evaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS in an Unrealized Loss Position 
 Gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL decreased billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to billion primarily due to a decrease in interest rates. 
 As shown in the table above, most of the gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL that have been in a continuous gross unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater at September 30, 2024, relate to investment grade securities. These unrealized losses are principally due to widening credit spreads since purchase and, with respect to fixed-rate securities, rising interest rates since purchase. 
 As of September 30, 2024, million of gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL that have been in a continuous gross unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater on below investment grade securities were concentrated in the utility, transportation and consumer sectors within corporate securities and in foreign government securities. These unrealized losses are the result of significantly wider credit spreads resulting from higher risk premiums since purchase, largely due to economic and market uncertainty and, with respect to fixed-rate securities, rising interest rates since purchase. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell its securities in an unrealized loss position without an ACL, and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost. Therefore, the Company concluded that these securities had not incurred a credit loss and should not have an ACL at September 30, 2024.

 Based on gross notional amounts, a substantial portion of the Company s derivatives was not designated or did not qualify as part of a hedging relationship at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company s use of derivatives includes (i) derivatives that serve as macro hedges of the Company s exposure to various risks and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the criteria required under the portfolio hedging rules, (ii) derivatives that economically hedge insurance liabilities that contain mortality or morbidity risk and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting because the lack of these risks in the derivatives cannot support an expectation of a highly effective hedging relationship, (iii) derivatives that economically hedge MRBs that do not qualify for hedge accounting because the changes in estimated fair value of the MRBs are already recorded in net income, and (iv) written credit default swaps and interest rate swaps that are used to synthetically create investments and that do not qualify for hedge accounting because they do not involve a hedging relationship. For these nonqualified derivatives, changes in market factors can lead to the recognition of fair value changes on the statement of operations without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.

 (1) The weighted average for fixed maturity securities AFS and derivatives is determined based on the estimated fair value of the securities and derivatives. The weighted average for MRBs is determined based on a combination of account values and experience data. 
 (2) The impact of a decrease in input would have resulted in the opposite impact on estimated fair value. For MRBs, changes to direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits are based on liability positions. 
 (3) Significant increases (decreases) in expected default rates in isolation would have resulted in substantially lower (higher) valuations. 
 (4) Range and weighted average are presented in accordance with the market convention for fixed maturity securities AFS of dollars per hundred dollars of par. 
 (5) Changes in the assumptions used for the probability of default would have been accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumptions used for prepayment rates. 
 (6) Ranges represent the rates across different yield curves and are presented in basis points. The swap yield curves are utilized among different types of derivatives to project cash flows, as well as to discount future cash flows to present value. Since this valuation methodology uses a range of inputs across a yield curve to value the derivative, presenting a range is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation.

 All other classes of securities classified within Level 3, including those within Other investments, Separate account assets, and Embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance, use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3 securities. Generally, all other classes of assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 that are not included above use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3. The sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in the significant unobservable inputs for these other assets and liabilities is similar in nature to that described in the preceding table. The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for the more significant assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis and determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are summarized in Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.

 asbestos-related claims in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company received approximately and new asbestos-related claims, respectively. See Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 Annual Report for historical information concerning asbestos claims and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s update in its recorded liability at December 31, 2023. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company may incur, and the total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain and may vary significantly from year to year. 
 The ability of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change. The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult to predict the numerous variables that can affect liability estimates, including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against Metropolitan Life Insurance Company when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. 
 The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years further in the future. In the Company s judgment, there is a future point after which losses cease to be probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the Company s total exposure to asbestos claims may be materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued and that future charges to income may be necessary, but management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material effect on the Company s financial position.

Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to make any material payments under these indemnities or guarantees. 
 In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the Company s interests.

 Forward-Looking Statements and Other Financial Information 
 For purposes of this discussion, MLIC, the Company, we, our and us refer to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, a New York corporation incorporated in 1868, and its subsidiaries. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (MetLife, Inc., together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife ). Management s narrative analysis of the Company s results of operations is presented pursuant to General Instruction H(2)(a) of Form 10-Q. This narrative analysis should be read in conjunction with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ), the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements included below, the Risk Factors set forth in Part II, Item 1A, and the additional risk factors referred to therein, and the Company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. 
 This narrative analysis may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements. 
 This narrative analysis includes references to our performance measure, adjusted earnings, that is not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). See Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures for definitions and a discussion of this and other financial measures, and Results of Operations for reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
 
 Business 
 
 Current Market Conditions 
 In the United States U.S. ), the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC took various actions in 2023 to promote economic stability and combat inflation, including raising interest rates. Rates remained steady through most of 2024. However, in September 2024, the FOMC lowered interest rates, and market forecasts suggest it will continue to reduce interest rates through the remainder of 2024 and 2025 reflecting expectations for continued lower inflation. 
 
 Regulatory Developments 
 The following discussion on regulatory developments should be read in conjunction with Business Regulation in the 2023 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented here. 
 State Insurance Regulation 
 Surplus and Capital 
 Investments 
 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC is focused on enhancing regulatory oversight of insurers investments in complex assets, such as structured securities. In connection with evaluating the risks of investing in leveraged loans and collateralized loan obligations CLOs ), the NAIC adopted an amendment to the Purposes and Procedures Manual in 2023. Under the amendment, the NAIC Structured Securities Group SSG will assign risk weights to CLOs based on its own modeling, as opposed to credit ratings. The SSG will model CLO investments and evaluate tranche level losses across all debt tranches under a series of calibrated and weighted collateral stress scenarios to assign NAIC designations that minimize risk-based capital RBC arbitrage. The NAIC s goal is to ensure that the aggregate RBC factor for owning all tranches of a CLO is similar to that required for owning all of the underlying loan collateral. In August 2024, the NAIC adopted an amendment to the Purposes and Procedures Manual, in which insurers are now required to begin reporting the financially modeled NAIC designations for CLOs with their year-end 2025 financial statement filings. The NAIC is collaborating with interested parties to refine the process for modeling CLO investments. 
 Innovation and Technology 
 The NAIC and state insurance regulators have been focused on addressing unfair discrimination in the use of consumer data and technology, and some states have passed laws targeting unfair discrimination practices. In July 2024, the New York State Department of Financial Services released its final circular letter focused on how insurers should develop and manage their use of external consumer data and artificial intelligence systems in underwriting and pricing so as not to harm consumers.

 Standards of Conduct, ERISA, Fiduciary Considerations, and Other Pension and Retirement Regulation 
 In 2023, the U.S. Department of Labor (the DOL proposed a regulation to change the definition of fiduciary for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA and parallel provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and to amend various existing prohibited transaction exemptions PTEs that financial professionals rely on when making recommendations. On April 23, 2024, the DOL finalized and published this new definition of fiduciary for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code and finalized and published amendments to these PTEs. Shortly thereafter, these changes were challenged in court, including by a coalition of insurance industry trade associations that filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and stay of the amendments. In July 2024, two federal district courts entered separate stays of the effective date of the new regulation regarding the definition of fiduciary and the amendments to the PTEs, pending further orders of the courts. We are evaluating the potential impact of these developments on our business, particularly as it pertains to the sale of insurance, annuity and welfare benefit products to retirement investors. 
 Management of Climate Risk 
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC is also continuing its focus on climate, and environmental, social and governance ESG risks and opportunities and has published its rulemaking list which contains certain ESG-related rulemakings that the SEC is considering. In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules requiring registrants to provide additional climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports, including in their financial statements. The rules include a phased-in compliance period beginning with the 2025 fiscal year for large accelerated reporting companies, including MetLife, Inc. Multiple parties initiated litigation challenging the final rules, and in April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the final rules pending completion of judicial review. 
 
 Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining: 
 (i) future policy benefit liabilities, market risk benefits MRBs and the accounting for reinsurance; 
 (ii) estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values; 
 (iii) investment allowance for credit loss and impairments; 
 (iv) estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives; 
 (v) measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities; 
 (vi) measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and 
 (vii) liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters. 
 In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 The Company s critical accounting estimates are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report.

The Group Benefits and RIS businesses were previously reported as the U.S. segment. These changes were applied retrospectively and did not have an impact on prior period total consolidated net income (loss) or adjusted earnings. In addition, the Company continues to report certain of its results of operations in Corporate Other. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company s segments and Corporate Other. 
 Key Financial Highlights

 Net income (loss) attributable to MLIC - Increased 127 million primarily due to the following: 
 Net Investment Gains (Losses) - Favorable change of 800 million 632 million, net of income tax): 
 Impairment losses in the prior period for investments disposed of in connection with a reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023 
 Partially offset by: 
 Losses on sales of fixed maturity securities in the current period

 Net Derivative Gains (Losses) - Favorable change of 108 million 85 million, net of income tax) (1) : 
 Long-term interest rates decreased in the current period compared to increased in the prior period - favorable impact to the estimated fair value of receiver swaps and swaptions 
 Key equity market volatility increased in the current period compared to decreased in the prior period - favorable impact to equity options 
 Partially offset by: 
 Change in the value of the underlying assets - unfavorable impact to embedded derivatives related to funds withheld on a certain reinsurance agreement 
 Market Risk Benefit Remeasurement (Gains) Losses (2) - Unfavorable change of 895 million 707 million, net of income tax):

 Total results for the nine months ended September 2024 and 2023 include gains of 84 million and 77 million, respectively: 
 Of the 84 million gain, a loss of 14 million was recognized in MRB remeasurement (gains) losses, a loss of 1 million was recognized in net derivative gains (losses), both of which are discussed above, and a gain of 99 million was recognized in adjusted earnings, which is discussed below 
 Of the 77 million gain, a loss of 7 million was recognized in MRB remeasurement (gains) losses, a loss of 2 million was recognized in net derivative gains (losses), both of which are discussed above, and a gain of 86 million was recognized in adjusted earnings, which is discussed below 
 The 7 million increase was primarily driven by (i) favorable mortality experience in the RIS segment in the current period and (ii) updates made in the prior period to morbidity assumptions in the MetLife Holdings segment associated with an increase in incident rates for our long-term care business, substantially offset by updates to policyholder behavior assumptions in the MetLife Holdings segment related to claim utilization experience for our long-term care business 
 Adjusted Earnings (3) - Unfavorable change of 229 million. See Consolidated Results Adjusted Earnings. 
 Taxes - Unfavorable change in effective tax rate - 17 in the current period compared to 14 in the prior period: 
 Current period effective tax rate on income before provision for income tax was 17 compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to tax benefits from: 
 Non-taxable investment income 
 Low income housing and other tax credits, partially offset by the impact of tax equity investments now accounted for under the proportional amortization method 
 Corporate tax deduction for stock compensation

 Consolidated Results Adjusted Earnings 
 Business Overview . Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.0 billion, or 10 , compared to the prior period. This was primarily due to growth in the pension risk transfer business and structured settlement sales in the RIS segment, as well as growth in the core and voluntary products in the Group Benefits segment, partially offset by a decrease in premiums related to our participating life contracts, which can fluctuate with claims experience, and the expected decline in the MetLife Holdings segment from business run-off. Changes in RIS premiums are generally offset by a corresponding change in policyholder benefits. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax. 
 Adjusted Earnings - Decreased 229 million primarily due to the following business drivers: 
 Reinsurance Transaction - Decreased adjusted earnings by approximately 120 million as a result of the reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023 in the MetLife Holdings segment 
 Market Factors - Decreased adjusted earnings by 42 million: 
 Higher average interest crediting rates on investment - type products, primarily in the RIS segment 
 Largely offset by: 
 Variable investment income increased - higher returns on private equity funds 
 Recurring investment income increased - higher yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans and higher returns on fair value option securities, partially offset by lower income on derivatives and lower average invested assets in the MetLife Holdings segment due to business run-off 
 Volume Growth - Increased adjusted earnings by 27 million: 
 Positive flows from pension risk transfer transactions and funding agreement issuances in the RIS segment, as well as higher average invested assets in Corporate Other 
 Partially offset by: 
 Increase in interest credited expenses on investment-type products, primarily in the RIS segment 
 Lower separate account fee revenue in the RIS segment 
 Underwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments - Decreased adjusted earnings by 90 million: 
 Unfavorable change from refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities in both periods - includes the unfavorable change from adjustments to certain deposit reinsurance assets and an unfavorable refinement in the current period on certain life policies in the Group Benefits segment 
 Largely offset by: 
 Favorable underwriting: 
 Favorable mortality - lower claims incidence in the life business in the Group Benefits segment 
 Favorable morbidity experience in the long-term care business in the MetLife Holdings segment 
 Actuarial Assumption Review - Increased adjusted earnings by 15 million: 
 2024 actuarial assumption review impacting the Group Benefits, RIS and MetLife Holdings segments - favorable impact of 99 million 
 2023 actuarial assumption review impacting the Group Benefits, RIS and MetLife Holdings segments - favorable impact of 86 million 
 Expenses - Increased adjusted earnings by 35 million: 
 Lower corporate-related expenses, including from initiatives and projects in Corporate Other 
 Largely offset by: 
 Higher technology, employee-related and various other operating expenses in the Group Benefits segment 
 97 

Table of Contents 

 Higher litigation reserves in Corporate Other 
 Higher reinsurance related variable expenses in the MetLife Holdings segment 
 Taxes - Unfavorable change in effective tax rate - 19 in the current period versus 16 in the prior period 
 Current period effective tax rate on income before provision for income tax was 19 versus the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to tax benefits from: 
 Non-taxable investment income 
 Low income housing and other tax credits, partially offset by the impact of tax equity investments now accounted for under the proportional amortization method 
 Corporate tax deduction for stock compensation 
 Prior period effective tax rate on income before provision for income tax was 16 versus the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to tax benefits from: 
 Low income housing and other tax credits 
 Non-taxable investment income 
 Corporate tax deduction for stock compensation

 Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures 
 In this report, the Company presents certain measures of its performance that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding for the Company and our investors of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. 
 The following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP: 
 Non-GAAP financial measures: Comparable GAAP financial measures: (i) adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues (i) premiums, fees and other revenues (ii) adjusted earnings (ii) net income (loss) 
 Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures are included in Results of Operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable effort to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income. 
 Our definitions of non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies. 
 Adjusted earnings 
 This measure is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance. Adjusted earnings allows analysis of our performance and facilitates comparisons to industry results. 
 Adjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax. For additional information relating to adjusted earnings, see Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies in Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
