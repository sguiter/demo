Fair value measurements for Nucor s cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and cash equivalents and an investment in a publicly traded nuclear power equipment manufacturer are classified under Level 1 because such measurements are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. Fair value measurements for Nucor s derivatives, which are typically commodity or foreign exchange contracts, are classified under Level 2 because such measurements are based on published market prices for similar assets or are estimated based on observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, credit risks, spot and future commodity prices, and spot and future exchange rates. Fair value measurements for Nucor's investments in privately held companies, most of which are in a nuclear fusion technology company, are classified under Level 3 because such measurements are based on unobservable inputs that indicate a change in fair value, including the transaction price in the event of a change in ownership of the investee (e.g., the sale of other investors' interest in the company) or the transaction price in the event of additional equity issuances of the investee. There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy for the periods presented. The fair value of short-term and long-term debt, including current maturities, was approximately billion at September 28, 2024 (approximately billion at December 31, 2023). The debt fair value estimates are classified under Level 2 because such estimates are based on readily available market prices of our debt at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , or similar debt with the same maturities, ratings and interest rates.

million. Rytec is a manufacturer and seller of high-performance overhead door s. Rytec produces spiral metal doors for warehouses, manufacturing facilities, auto dealerships, and parking garages, as well as durable fabric doors that are used in cold storage, manufacturing and clean room applications. We believe this acquisition will help Nucor and C.H.I. Overhead Doors, LLC continue to grow their sales to the commercial market. The Rytec financial results are included as part of the steel products segment (see Note 14) beginning on July 23, 2024, the date Nucor acquired Rytec. We allocated the purchase price for Rytec to its individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. While the purchase price allocation is substantially complete, it is still preliminary and subject to change.

The goodwill of million is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and has been allocated to the steel products segment (see Note 14). The goodwill is attributable to expected synergies within the steel products segment. Goodwill recognized for tax purposes was million, all of which is deductible for tax purposes. Pro-forma results of operations for the Company would not be materially different as a result of the acquisition of Rytec and, therefore, this information is not presented.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Certain statements made in this report, or in other public filings, press releases, or other written or oral communications made by Nucor, which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which we expect will or may occur in the future and may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The words anticipate, believe, expect, intend, project, may, will, should, could and similar expressions are intended to identify those forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company s best judgment based on current information, and, although we base these statements on circumstances that we believe to be reasonable when made, there can be no assurance that future events will not affect the accuracy of such forward-looking information. As such, the forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may vary materially from the projected results and expectations discussed in this report. Factors that might cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (1) competitive pressure on sales and pricing, including pressure from imports and substitute materials; (2) U.S. and foreign trade policies affecting steel imports or exports; (3) the sensitivity of the results of our operations to general market conditions, and in particular, prevailing market steel prices and changes in the supply and cost of raw materials, including pig iron, iron ore and scrap steel; (4) the availability and cost of electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect our cost of steel production or result in a delay or cancellation of existing or future drilling within our natural gas drilling programs; (5) critical equipment failures and business interruptions; (6) market demand for steel products, which, in the case of many of our products, is driven by the level of nonresidential construction activity in the United States; (7) impairment in the recorded value of inventory, equity investments, fixed assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets; (8) uncertainties and volatility surrounding the global economy, including excess world capacity for steel production, inflation and interest rate changes; (9) fluctuations in currency conversion rates; (10) significant changes in laws or government regulations affecting environmental compliance, including legislation and regulations that result in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our energy costs, capital expenditures and operating costs or cause one or more of our permits to be revoked or make it more difficult to obtain permit modifications; (11) the cyclical nature of the steel industry; (12) capital investments and their impact on our performance; (13) our safety performance; (14) our ability to integrate businesses we acquire; (15) the impact of any pandemic or public health situation; and (16) the risks discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and elsewhere in this report. 
 Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements included in this report. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as may be required by law. In evaluating forward-looking statements, these risks and uncertainties should be considered, together with the other risks described from time to time in our reports and other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

Risk Factors and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Nucor s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Overview 
 Nucor and its affiliates manufacture steel and steel products. Nucor also produces DRI for use in its steel mills. Through DJJ, the Company also processes ferrous and nonferrous metals and brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron, hot briquetted iron and DRI. Most of Nucor s operating facilities and customers are located in North America. Nucor s operations include international trading and sales companies that buy and sell steel and steel products manufactured by the Company and others. Nucor is North America s largest recycler, using scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products. 
 Nucor reports its results in the following segments: steel mills, steel products and raw materials. The steel mills segment includes carbon and alloy steel in sheet, bars, structural and plate; steel trading and rebar distribution businesses; and Nucor s equity method investment in NuMit. The steel products segment includes steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, precision castings, steel fasteners, metal building systems, insulated metal panels, overhead doors, steel grating, tubular products, steel racking, piling products, wire and wire mesh, and utility towers and structures. The raw materials segment includes DJJ, primarily a scrap broker and processor; Nu-Iron Unlimited and Nucor Steel Louisiana, two facilities that produce DRI used by the steel mills; and our natural gas production operations.

The average utilization rates of all operating facilities in the steel mills, steel products and raw materials segments were approximately 77 , 59 and 73 , respectively, in the first nine months of 2024 compared with approximately 80 , 66 and 74 , respectively, in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Results of Operations 
 Nucor reported net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of 249.9 million, or 1.05 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of 1.14 billion, or 4.57 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Included in the third quarter of 2024 net earnings was 123.0 million of losses and impairments of assets (none in the third quarter of 2023). Of that amount, 83.0 million related to certain non-current assets in the raw materials segment and 40.0 million related to certain non-current assets in the steel products segment. 
 Excluding the losses and impairments of assets, the largest driver of the decrease in earnings in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was the decreased earnings of the steel mills segment. Though shipments to outside customers improved slightly in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, metal margins decreased significantly as average selling prices decreased across all product groups within the steel mills segment. The steel products segment s earnings in the third quarter of 2024 decreased significantly compared to the third quarter of 2023. The primary driver of the decrease in the earnings of the steel products segment was the decreased earnings of our joist and deck businesses, which had decreased average selling prices and lower volumes. Earnings in the raw materials segment decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the decreased performance of our scrap processing and DRI operations. 
 Nucor reported net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of 1.74 billion, or 7.22 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of 3.74 billion, or 14.83 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. Earnings decreased across all three segments for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, with the largest decrease in the steel products segment. In the steel products segment, average selling prices for our joist and deck businesses have moderated from historically high levels and steadily declined from the beginning of 2023 through the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in average selling prices, combined with lower volumes for the joist and deck businesses, were the largest contributors to the decrease in the earnings of the steel products segment in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. The steel mills segment's earnings decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to lower metal margins caused by lower average selling prices and decreased volumes. Earnings in the raw materials segment decreased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to the decreased earnings of our scrap processing and DRI operations. 
 The following discussion provides a greater quantitative and qualitative analysis of Nucor s performance in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023.

Gross Margins 
 Nucor recorded gross margins of 757.9 million (10 in the third quarter of 2024, which was a decrease compared to 1.92 billion (22 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The largest driver of the decrease in gross margins in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 was lower metal margins across the steel mills segment. Metal margin is the difference between the selling price of steel and the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes. 

Scrap and scrap substitutes are the most significant element in the total cost of steel production. In the steel mills segment, the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per gross ton used in the third quarter of 2024 was 378, a 9 decrease compared to 415 in the third quarter of 2023. Though scrap and scrap substitute costs decreased in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, total metal margin dollars decreased as the decrease in average selling prices outpaced the decrease in scrap and scrap substitute costs. 
 Scrap prices are driven by the global supply and demand for scrap and other iron-based raw materials used to make steel. As we enter the fourth quarter of 2024, scrap prices are comparable to the third quarter of 2024. 
 Gross margins in the steel products segment decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to decreases at our joist and deck businesses. 

Pre-operating and start-up costs of new facilities were approximately 168 million in the third quarter of 2024 and approximately 100 million in the third quarter of 2023. Pre-operating and start-up costs in the third quarter of both 2024 and 2023 primarily included costs related to the plate mill in Kentucky and the sheet mill under construction in West Virginia. Nucor defines pre-operating and start-up costs, all of which are expensed, as the losses attributable to facilities or major projects that are either under construction or in the early stages of operation. Once these facilities or projects have attained a utilization rate that is consistent with our similar operating facilities, Nucor no longer considers them to be in start-up. 

Gross margins in the raw materials segment decreased in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to the decreased earnings of the scrap processing and DRI operations. 

Nucor recorded gross margins of 3.48 billion (15 in the first nine months of 2024, which was a decrease compared to 6.42 billion (24 in the first nine months of 2023. 
 The largest driver of the decrease in gross margins in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 was the decreased earnings of the steel products segment, which was primarily due to the decreased profitability of our joist and deck businesses. 

In the steel mills segment, the average scrap and scrap substitute cost per gross ton used in the first nine months of 2024 was 399, a 7 decrease compared to 429 in the first nine months of 2023. However, the decrease in scrap and scrap substitute costs was more than offset by the decreases in average selling prices and volumes, resulting in lower metal margins. 

Pre-operating and start-up costs of new facilities increased to approximately 430 million in the first nine months of 2024 from approximately 273 million in the first nine months of 2023. Pre-operating and start-up costs in the first nine months of both 2024 and 2023 primarily included costs related to the plate mill in Kentucky and the sheet mill under construction in West Virginia. 

Gross margins in the raw materials segment decreased in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to the decreased earnings of the scrap processing and DRI operations.

Marketing, Administrative and Other Expenses 	 A major component of marketing, administrative and other expenses is profit sharing and other incentive compensation costs. These costs, which are based upon and fluctuate with Nucor s financial performance, decreased by 119.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, and decreased by 285.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. These decreases were due to Nucor's decreased profitability in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to the respective prior year periods, which resulted in decreased accruals related to profit sharing. 
 Equity in (Earnings) Losses of Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was 5.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, and equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates was 1.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was 24.1 million and 3.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increases in equity method investment earnings were primarily due to the increased results of NuMit. 
 
 Losses and Impairments of Assets 
 
 Included in the third quarter of 2024 net earnings was 123.0 million of losses and impairments of assets (none in the third quarter of 2023). During the third quarter of 2024, management determined it was probable that a long-term note receivable in the raw materials segment was no longer collectable and recorded an 83.0 million impairment charge to fully reserve the note receivable. The remaining 40.0 million is related to certain non-current assets, mostly property, plant and equipment, net, related to a business in the steel products segment.

Noncontrolling Interests 
 Noncontrolling interests represent the income attributable to the holders of noncontrolling interests in Nucor s joint ventures, NYS, CSI and NJSM. Nucor owns a 51 controlling interest in each of NYS, CSI and NJSM. The decrease in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the decreased earnings of NYS and CSI, and the losses of NJSM in the current year (NJSM was not included in noncontrolling interests until the fourth quarter of 2023, when Nucor obtained a controlling interest). The decrease in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to the decreased earnings of NYS and CSI, and the losses of NJSM in the current year. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 22.0 compared to 21.1 for the third quarter of 2023. The expected effective tax rate for the full year of 2024 is approximately 21.5 . 
 We estimate that in the next 12 months our gross unrecognized tax benefits, which totaled 213.8 million at September 28, 2024, exclusive of interest, could decrease by as much as 9.2 million as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and the closures of examinations, substantially all of which would impact the effective tax rate. 
 The IRS is currently examining Nucor s 2015, 2019 and 2020 federal income tax returns. Nucor has concluded U.S. federal income tax matters for the tax years through 2014, and for the tax years 2016 through 2018. The tax years 2021 through 2023 remain open to examination by the IRS. The 2015 through 2021 Canadian income tax returns for Nucor Rebar Fabrication Group Inc. (formerly known as Harris Steel Group Inc.) and certain related affiliates are currently under examination by the Canada Revenue Agency. The tax years 2016 through 2023 remain open to examination by other major taxing jurisdictions to which Nucor is subject (primarily Canada, Trinidad Tobago, and other state and local jurisdictions). 
 Net Earnings Attributable to Nucor Stockholders and Return on Equity 
 Nucor reported net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of 249.9 million, or 1.05 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of 1.14 billion, or 4.57 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders as a percentage of net sales were 3.4 and 13.0 in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Nucor reported net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of 1.74 billion, or 7.22 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders of 3.74 billion, or 14.83 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2023. Net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders as a percentage of net sales were 7.4 and 13.8 in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Annualized return on average stockholders equity was 11.2 and 25.6 in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Outlook 
 We expect consolidated net earnings attributable to Nucor stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2024 to decrease compared to earnings per diluted share of 1.05 reported for the third quarter of 2024. The largest driver of the expected decrease in earnings in the fourth quarter of 2024 is the expected decrease in earnings of the steel mills segment caused by lower average selling prices and decreased volumes. We expect earnings in the steel products segment to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 due to lower average selling prices and decreased volumes. The earnings of the raw materials segment are expected to increase in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2024 (excluding the impairment charge taken during the third quarter of 2024). 
 Nucor s largest exposure to market risk is in our steel mills and steel products segments. Our largest single customer in the third quarter of 2024 represented approximately 5 of sales and has consistently paid within terms. In the raw materials segment, we are exposed to price fluctuations related to the purchase of scrap and scrap substitutes, pig iron and iron ore. Businesses within the steel mills segment account for the majority of the raw materials segment s sales.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We currently have the highest credit ratings of any steel producer headquartered in North America, with an A- long-term rating from Standard Poor s, an A- long-term rating from Fitch Ratings and a Baa1 long-term rating from Moody s. Our credit ratings are dependent, however, upon a number of factors, both qualitative and quantitative, and are subject to change at any time. The disclosure of our credit ratings is made in order to enhance investors understanding of our sources of liquidity and the impact of our credit ratings on our cost of funds. 
 
 Our liquidity position as of September 28, 2024 remained strong, consisting of total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 4.86 billion 7.13 billion as of December 31, 2023). Approximately 899.1 million of the cash and cash equivalents position at September 28, 2024, was held by our majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries as compared to 1.05 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 3.25 billion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 5.59 billion in the first nine months of 2023. The 2.34 billion decrease was primarily driven by net earnings before noncontrolling interests of 1.97 billion for the first nine months of 2024, which represented a decrease of 2.07 billion from net earnings before noncontrolling interests for the prior year period of 4.04 billion. In addition, changes in operating assets and operating liabilities (exclusive of acquisitions and dispositions) provided cash of 130.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 604.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 The funding provided by our working capital in the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 473.6 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 mainly due to the change in accounts payable using 371.2 million more cash, federal income taxes providing less cash of 224.1 million and the change in accounts receivable providing 124.8 million less cash compared to the same period in 2023. These changes were partially offset by the change in inventories providing more cash of 287.0 million. 
 
 The current ratio was 2.6 at the end of the third quarter of 2024 and 3.6 at year-end 2023. The decrease in the current ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to year-end 2023 was primarily due to the 2.86 billion, or 17 , decrease in current assets. The main driver of the decrease in current assets was the 2.12 billion, or 33 decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Also contributing to the decrease in the current ratio was the 622.3 million, or 14 , increase in current liabilities. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the 966.3 million increase in the current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations and the 94.5 million increase in short-term debt. These changes were offset by the 117.4 million decrease in accounts payable and the 351.8 million decrease in salaries, wages and related accruals. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 2.77 billion as compared to 1.84 billion in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 929.7 million. Cash used for capital expenditures of 2.29 billion in the first nine months of 2024 increased by 797.6 million as compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to the sheet mill under construction in West Virginia, the sheet mill expansion in Indiana and the rebar micro mill under construction in North Carolina. Capital expenditures for 2024 are estimated to be approximately 3.2 billion as compared to 2.20 billion for 2023. The projects that we anticipate will have the largest capital expenditures in 2024 are the sheet mill under construction in West Virginia, the sheet mill expansion in Indiana, the rebar micro mill under construction in North Carolina and the construction of two manufacturing locations to expand Nucor Towers Structures. Also contributing to the increase in cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 over the same period of 2023 was the acquisition (net of cash acquired) of Rytec for approximately 565.0 million during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was 2.60 billion as compared to 2.24 billion in the first nine months of 2023. The primary uses of cash were stock repurchases of 1.90 billion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 1.38 billion in the first nine months of 2023, which represented an increase of 524.8 million. Partially offsetting the increase in stock repurchases was the 79.0 million decrease in distributions to noncontrolling interests in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Nucor s 1.75 billion revolving credit facility matures on November 5, 2026. The revolving credit facility includes only one financial covenant, which is a limit of 60 on the ratio of funded debt to total capital. In addition, the revolving credit facility contains customary non-financial covenants, including a limit on Nucor s ability to pledge the Company s assets and a limit on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. As of September 28, 2024, the funded debt to total capital ratio was 24.4 and we were in compliance with all non-financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. No borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of September 28, 2024.

In September 2024, Nucor s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Nucor s common stock of 0.54 per share payable on November 8, 2024 to stockholders of record on September 27, 2024. This dividend is Nucor s 206 th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. 
 
 Funds provided from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and new borrowings under our existing credit facilities are expected to be adequate to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements for existing operations for at least the next 24 months. We also believe we have adequate access to capital markets for liquidity purposes. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks. We continually monitor these risks and develop strategies to manage them. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. Nucor also occasionally makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes. Management does not believe that Nucor s exposure to interest rate risk has significantly changed since December 31, 2023. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding at September 28, 2024. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 In the ordinary course of business, Nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy, principally scrap steel, other ferrous and nonferrous metals, alloys and natural gas. We attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw material and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand. In periods of strong or stable demand for our products, we are more likely to be able to effectively reduce the normal time lag in passing through higher raw material costs so that we can maintain our gross margins. When demand for our products is weaker, this becomes more challenging. Our DRI facilities in Trinidad and Louisiana provide us with flexibility in managing our raw material requirements and our input costs. DRI is particularly important for operational flexibility when demand for prime scrap increases due to increased domestic steel production. 
 Natural gas produced by Nucor s production operations is being sold to third parties to partially offset our exposure to changes in the price of natural gas consumed by our Louisiana DRI facility and our steel mills in the United States. 
 Nucor also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our steel, scrap, aluminum and copper purchases and sales. Gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and recognized in net earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction. At September 28, 2024, accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes included 6.3 million in unrealized net-of-tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments. Changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in net earnings each period. 
 The following table presents the negative effect on pre-tax earnings of a hypothetical change in the fair value of the derivative instruments outstanding at September 28, 2024, due to an assumed 10 and 25 change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities (in thousands):

 10 Change 

25 Change 

Natural gas 

12,914 

32,286 

Other commodities 

12,402 

30,979 

Any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes or recognized in net earnings, as appropriate. These hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities.

Foreign Currency Risk 
 Nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through its operations in Canada, Europe and Mexico. We periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations. Open foreign currency derivative contracts at September 28, 2024 were insignificant.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Nucor is from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we record reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not believe that any of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Nucor maintains liability insurance with self-insurance limits for certain risks. 
 
 During 2022, Nucor Steel Louisiana, our DRI facility located in St. James Parish, Louisiana, received allegations of violations of the Clean Air Act from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. A combined settlement is currently being negotiated with the United States Department of Justice, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. We do not believe that any aggregate settlement for these allegations will be material to Nucor. 
 
 There were no other proceedings that were pending or contemplated under federal, state or local environmental laws that the Company reasonably believes may result in monetary sanctions of at least 1.0 million (the threshold chosen by Nucor as permitted by Item 103 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and which Nucor believes is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding that is material to its business or financial condition). 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 There have been no material changes in Nucor s risk factors from those included in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Nucor s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
