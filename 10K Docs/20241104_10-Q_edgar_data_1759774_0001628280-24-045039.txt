 million and million as compared to the principal balance of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of the Company s secured borrowings was categorized as a Level 3 fair value estimate (as provided by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures) and was determined by discounting the future contractual interest and principal payments by a market rate. 
 The Company's derivative assets and liabilities, comprised of interest rate swap derivative instruments entered into in connection with the Credit Facilities, are recorded at fair value based on a variety of observable inputs, including contractual terms, interest rate curves, yield curves, measure of volatility and correlations of such inputs. The Company measures its derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis based on the expected amount of future cash flows on a discounted basis and incorporating a measure of non-performance risk. The fair value of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities was categorized as a Level 2 fair value estimate (as provided by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures). The Company considers its own credit risk, as well as the credit risk of its counterparties, when evaluating the fair value of its derivative assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company s interest rate swap derivative assets was approximately million and million, respectively, included in Prepaid expenses and other assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Disclosures about fair value of assets and liabilities are based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since September 30, 2024 and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.

 The Company s objectives in using the interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company uses the interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges, with any gain or loss recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassified into interest expense as interest payments are made on the Credit Facilities. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional million will be reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a decrease to interest expense. 
 
 The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. Amount of income reclassified from "Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income" into interest expense

 Overview 
 Company 
 We were formed as a Maryland corporation on November 19, 2018 and commenced operations upon completion of our initial public offering and the related formation transactions. We conduct our business through a traditional UPREIT structure in which our properties are owned by our Operating Partnership directly or through limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other subsidiaries. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired 134 properties leased to the USPS for approximately 61.4 million, including closing costs. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio consists of 1,642 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 owned properties, located in 49 states and one territory and comprising approximately 6.3 million net leasable interior square feet. 
 We are the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership through which our properties are directly or indirectly owned. As of November 4, 2024, we owned approximately 79.1 of outstanding common units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership (the OP Units ), including long term incentive units of our Operating Partnership (the LTIP Units ). Our Board of Directors oversees our business and affairs. 
 ATM Program 
 On November 4, 2022, we entered into separate open market sale agreements for our at-the-market offering program (the "ATM Program") with each of Jefferies LLC, BMO Capital Markets Corp., Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated and Truist Securities, Inc., as agents, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to 50.0 million. The agreements also provide that we may enter into one or more forward sale agreements under separate master forward confirmations and related supplemental confirmations with affiliates of certain agents. On August 8, 2023, we amended the ATM Program to increase the aggregate offering amount under the program from up to 50.0 million to up to 150.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1,235,346 shares were issued under the ATM Program for approximately 17.7 million in gross proceeds. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 96.4 million of availability remaining under the ATM Program. 
 Executive Overview 
 We are an internally managed REIT with a focus on acquiring and managing properties leased primarily to the USPS, ranging from last-mile post offices to industrial facilities. We believe the overall opportunity for consolidation that exists within the postal logistics network is very attractive. We continue to execute our strategy to acquire and consolidate postal properties that we believe will generate strong earnings for our shareholders. 
 Geographic Concentration 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned a portfolio of 1,642 properties located in 49 states and one territory and leased primarily to the USPS. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 12.2 of our total rental income was concentrated in Pennsylvania.

 In addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have availed ourselves of these exemptions; although, subject to certain restrictions, we may elect to stop availing ourselves of these exemptions in the future even while we remain an emerging growth company. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenue equals or exceeds 1.235 billion (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). 
 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and have elected to take advantage of certain scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company.

 We elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), beginning with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2019 and intend to continue to qualify as a REIT. As long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute our taxable income for each tax year to our stockholders. 
 
 Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations 
 The USPS 
 
 We are dependent on the USPS financial and operational stability. The USPS is currently facing a variety of circumstances that are threatening its ability to fund its operations and other obligations as currently conducted without intervention by the federal government. The USPS is constrained by laws and regulations that restrict revenue sources and pricing, mandate certain expenses and cap its borrowing capacity. As a result, among other consequences, the USPS is unable to fund its mandated expenses and continues to be subject to mandated payments to its retirement system and benefits. While the USPS has recently undertaken, and proposes to undertake, a number of operational reforms and cost reduction measures, such as higher rates and slower deliveries for certain services and closure, relocation or consolidation of certain facilities and delivery routes, the USPS has taken the position such measures alone will not be sufficient to maintain its ability to meet all of its existing obligations when due or allow it to make the critical infrastructure investments that have been deferred in recent years. These measures have also led to significant criticism and litigation, which may result in reputational or financial harm or increased regulatory scrutiny of the USPS or reduced demand for its services. The occurrence of a regional epidemic or a global pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken to prevent its spread may also have a material and unpredictable effect on the USPS operations and liquidity, including significant additional operating expenses caused by pandemic-related disruptions. The lingering effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and other geopolitical and economic factors have also created significant inflationary pressures resulting in higher compensation, benefits, transportation and fuel costs for the USPS. If the USPS becomes unable to meet its financial obligations or its revenue declines due to reduced demand for its services, the USPS may reduce its demand for leasing postal properties, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For additional information regarding the risks associated with the USPS, see the section entitled Risk Factors - Risks Related to the USPS under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Revenues 
 We derive revenues primarily from rent and tenant reimbursements under leases with the USPS for our properties and fee and other from the management of postal properties owned by Andrew Spodek, our chief executive officer, and his affiliates managed by our taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ), income recognized from properties accounted for as financing leases and revenue from providing certain advisory services. Rental income represents the lease revenue recognized under the leases primarily with the USPS which includes the impact of above and below market lease intangibles as well as reimbursements to us made by our tenants for the real estate taxes paid at each property where tenants are responsible for such taxes under the leases. Certain of our leases include annual rent escalators. Fee and other principally represents (i) revenue our TRS received from postal properties owned by Mr. Spodek and his affiliates pursuant to the management agreements and is a percentage of the lease revenue for the managed properties, (ii) revenue our TRS received from providing advisory services to third-party owners of postal properties and (iii) income recognized from properties accounted for as financing leases. As of September 30, 2024, properties leased to our tenants had an average remaining lease term of approximately three years. Factors that could affect our rental income and fee and other in the future include, but are not limited to: (i) our ability to renew or replace expiring leases and management agreements; (ii) local, regional or national economic conditions; (iii) an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, postal space; (iv) changes in market rental rates; (v) changes to the USPS current property leasing program or form of lease; and (vi) our ability to provide adequate services and maintenance at our properties and managed properties. 
 Operating Expenses 
 We lease our properties primarily to the USPS. The majority of our leases are modified double-net leases, whereby the tenant is responsible for utilities, certain maintenance obligations and reimbursement of property taxes and the landlord is generally responsible for insurance, roof and structure. Thus, an increase in costs related to the landlord s responsibilities under these leases could negatively influence our operating results. Refer to Lease Renewal below for further discussion. 
 Operating expenses generally consist of real estate taxes, property operating expenses, which consist of insurance, repairs and maintenance (other than those for which the tenant is responsible), property maintenance-related payroll and depreciation and amortization. Factors that may affect our ability to control these operating costs include but are not limited to: the cost of periodic repair, age and durability of our properties, renovation costs, landlord s responsibilities under the leases, the cost of re-leasing space, inflation and the potential for liability under applicable laws. Recoveries from the tenant are recognized 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 as revenue on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred. Tenant reimbursements and the related property operating expenses are recognized on a gross basis, because (i) generally, we are the primary obligor with respect to the real estate taxes and (ii) we bear the credit risk in the event the tenant does not reimburse the real estate taxes. 
 The expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances, such as market factors and competition, cause a reduction in income from the property. If revenues drop, we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly. Costs associated with real estate investments generally will not be materially reduced even if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease. As a result, if revenues decrease in the future, static operating costs may adversely affect our future cash flow and results of operations. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense represents personnel costs, professional fees, legal fees, insurance, consulting fees, information technology costs and other expenses related to our day-to-day activities of being a public company. While we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to rise as our portfolio grows, we expect that such expenses as a percentage of our revenues will decrease over time due to efficiencies and economies of scale. 
 Equity-Based Compensation Expense 
 All equity-based compensation expense is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income as components of general and administrative expense and property operating expenses. We issue share-based awards to align our directors' and employees interests with those of our investors. 
 Indebtedness and Interest Expense 
 
 Our credit facilities (the "Credit Facilities") consist of a 150.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), a 75.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the "2021 Term Loan") and a 125.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the "2022 Term Loan"). On October 25, 2024, we amended the Credit Facilities (the "Third Amendment") to, among other things, replaces the Bank of Montreal with Truist Bank as the administrative agent, letter of credit issuer and swingline lender. In addition, the third amendment increases the 2022 Term Loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to 50.0 million in which we further exercised 40.0 million under the 2022 Term Loan, and on a delayed-draw basis, 10.0 million. We intend to use the Credit Facilities for working capital purposes, which may include repayment of mortgage indebtedness, property acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. We amortize on a non-cash basis the deferred financing costs associated with our debt to interest expense using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest rate method over the terms of the related loans. Debt discounts represent fair value adjustments to account for the difference between the stated rates and market rates of debt assumed or entered in connection with our property acquisitions. The debt premiums discounts are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related loans using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective-interest rate method. Any changes to the debt structure, including debt financing associated with property acquisitions, could materially influence the operating results depending on the terms of any such indebtedness. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that they distribute each year at least 90 of their REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. Even though we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to state and local taxes on our income and assets and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Additionally, any income earned by our existing TRS and any other TRS we may form in the future will be subject to federal, state and local corporate income tax. 
 Lease Renewal 
 
 As of November 4, 2024, the leases at 17 of our properties, representing approximately 500,000 net leasable interior square feet, had expired and the USPS was occupying such properties as a holdover tenant. As of the date of this report, the USPS had not vacated or notified us of its intention to vacate any of these properties. When a lease expires, the USPS becomes 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 a holdover tenant on a month-to-month basis typically paying the greater of estimated market rent or the rent amount under the expired lease. 
 
 While we currently anticipate that we will renew the leases that have expired or will expire, there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in renewing these leases, obtaining positive rent renewal spreads or renewing the leases on terms comparable to those of the expiring leases. Even if we are able to renew these expired leases, the lease terms may not be comparable to those of the previous leases. If we are not successful, we will likely experience reduced occupancy, rental income and net operating income, as well as diminished borrowing capacity under our Credit Facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to shareholders. Refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to the USPS under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding the risks associated with the USPS.

 Cash Flows 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 We had 1.0 million of cash and 0.5 million of escrows and reserves as of September 30, 2024 compared to 2.5 million of cash and 0.4 million of escrows and reserves as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 3.0 million to 24.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to the volume our acquisitions, all of which have generated additional rental income and related changes in working capital, as well as the timing of certain receivables and payables. 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of 53.2 million of acquisitions and 2.7 million of escrow deposits for acquisitions, capital improvements and other investing activities.

The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in net proceeds received from issuance of shares during the same period partially offset by an increase in the payment of dividends and distributions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We had approximately 1.0 million of cash and 0.5 million of escrows and reserves as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans 
 
 We have entered into the Credit Facilities, which include the 150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. the 2021 Term Loan and the 2022 Term Loan (and, together with the 2021 Term Loan, the "Term Loans") , with Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent, and BMO Capital Markets Corp., M T Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Truist Securities, Inc. as joint lead arrangers and joint book runners. Additional participants in the Credit Facilities include Stifel Bank Trust and TriState Capital Bank. On October 25, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment, replacing Bank of Montreal as the administrative agent with Truist Bank and further exercised 40.0 million of term loan accordion under the 2022 Term Loan and, on a delayed-draw basis, 10.0 million of 2022 Term Loan. 
 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, we had 244.0 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding under our Credit Facilities, with 75.0 million drawn on the 2021 Term Loan, 125.0 million drawn on the 2022 Term Loan and 44.0 million drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 The Credit Facilities include an accordion feature which permit us to borrow up to an additional 150.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to customary terms and conditions. The Revolving Credit Facility matures in January 2026, which may be extended for two six-month periods subject to customary conditions, the 2021 Term Loan matures in January 2027 and the 2022 Term Loan matures in February 2028. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities carry an interest rate of, (i) in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined below) plus a margin ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 per annum, or (ii) in the case of the Term Loans, either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.45 to 0.95 per annum or Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.45 to 1.95 per annum, in each case depending on a consolidated leverage ratio. With respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, we will pay, if the usage is equal to or less than 50 , an unused facility fee of 0.20 per annum, or if the usage is greater than 50 , an unused facility fee of 0.15 per annum, in each case on the average daily unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 The Credit Facilities are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by us and certain of our indirect subsidiaries and contain customary covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens on assets, make certain types of investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, sell assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates and pay dividends or make distributions. The Credit Facilities require compliance with consolidated financial maintenance covenants to be tested quarterly, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, maximum total leverage ratio, minimum tangible net worth, maximum secured leverage ratio, maximum unsecured leverage ratio, minimum unsecured debt service coverage ratio and maximum secured recourse leverage ratio. The Credit Facilities also contain certain customary events of default, including the failure to make timely payments under the Credit Facilities, any event or condition that makes other material indebtedness due prior to its scheduled maturity, the failure to satisfy certain covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the Credit Facilities debt covenants. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had seven interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 200.0 million that are used to manage our interest rate risk and fix the SOFR component on the Term Loans of the Credit Facilities (together, the "Interest Rate Swaps"). See Note 6. Derivatives and Hedging Activities in the Notes to our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 1 herein for further details regarding the Interest Rate Swaps. 
 
 On October 25, 2024, in connection with the exercise of 40.0 million term loan accordion under the 2022 Term Loan, we further entered into an interest rate swap that effectively fixed the interest rate on the additional 40.0 million of the 2022 Term Loan through February 2028 at 5.3705 . 
 Capital Resources and Financing Strategy 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, distributions to our limited partners and distributions to our stockholders required to qualify for REIT status, capital expenditures and property acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, cash, borrowings under our Credit Facilities and the potential issuance of securities. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we may issue equity financing through the instruments and on the terms most attractive to us at such time, including through our 150.0 million ATM Program. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary for the repayment of debt at maturity, distributions to our limited partners and distributions to our stockholders required to qualify for REIT status, property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations, long-term indebtedness including our Credit Facilities and mortgage financing, the issuance of equity and debt securities and proceeds from select sales of our properties. We also may fund property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements using our Credit Facilities pending permanent property-level financing. 
 We believe we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity securities. However, in the future, there may be a number of factors that could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including unfavorable conditions in the overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base, borrowing restrictions imposed by our lenders, general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance, liquidity and market perceptions about us. The success of our business strategy will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to access these various capital sources. In addition, we continuously evaluate possible acquisitions of postal properties, which largely depend on, among other 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 things, the market for owning and leasing postal properties and the terms on which the USPS will enter into new or renewed leases. 
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding capital gains. As a result of this requirement, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our business needs to the same extent as other entities that are not REITs. If we do not have sufficient funds available to us from our operations to fund our business needs, we will need to find alternative ways to fund those needs. Such alternatives may include, among other things, divesting ourselves of properties (whether or not the sales price is optimal or otherwise meets our strategic long-term objectives), incurring indebtedness or issuing equity securities in public or private transactions, the availability and attractiveness of the terms of which cannot be assured. 
 Consolidated Indebtedness 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 278.3 million of outstanding consolidated principal indebtedness. The following table sets forth information as of September 30, 2024 with respect to our outstanding indebtedness (in thousands):

Upon our achievement of certain sustainability targets for 2023 , the applicable margins for the Credit Facilities were reduced by 0.02 for the year ending December 31, 2024, which is reflected in the margins noted in the table above. 
 
 (3) Five properties are collateralized under this loan and Mr. Spodek also provided a personal guarantee of payment for 50 of the outstanding amount thereunder. The loan has a fixed interest rate of 3.69 for the first five years with interest payments only (ending in October 2026), then adjusting every subsequent five-year period thereafter with principal and interest payments to the rate based on the five-year weekly average yield on United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of five years, as made available to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Five-Year Treasury Rate"), plus a margin of 2.75 , with a minimum annual rate of 2.75 . 
 (4) The loan is collateralized by first mortgage liens on four properties and a personal guarantee of payment by Mr. Spodek.

 then adjusting every subsequent five-year period thereafter with principal and interest payments to the rate based on the Five-Year Treasury Rate, plus a margin of 2.75 , with a minimum annual rate of 2.75 . 
 (6) In connection with the acquisition of a property, we obtained seller financing secured by the property in the amount of 0.4 million requiring five annual payments of principal and interest of 0.1 million with the first installment due on January 2, 2021 based on a 6.0 interest rate per annum through January 2, 2025. 
 (7) The loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on an industrial property located in Warrendale, Pennsylvania. The loan has a fixed interest rate of 2.80 with interest-only payments for the first five years (ending in January 2026) and fixed payments of principal and interest thereafter based on a 30-year amortization schedule. 
 (8) In connection with the acquisition of two properties, we obtained seller financing secured by the properties in the amount of 1.4 million based on a fixed interest rate of 5.00 with interest-only payments through September 1, 2039. 
 Secured Borrowings as of September 30, 2024 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 34.3 million of secured borrowings outstanding, all of which are currently fixed-rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.96 per annum. 
 Dividends 
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to pay dividends to stockholders at least equal to 90 of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid cash dividends of 0.24 and 0.72 per share, respectively. Our Board of Directors approved, and o n October 22, 2024 , we declared a third quarter 2024 common stock dividend of 0.24 per share, which will be paid on November 29, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 4, 2024. 
 Inflation 
 Because most of our leases provide for fixed annual rental payments without annual rent escalations, our rental revenues are fixed while our property operating expenses are subject to inflationary increases. A majority of our leases provide for tenant reimbursement of real estate taxes and thus the tenant must reimburse us for real estate taxes. We believe that if inflation increases expenses over time, increases in lease renewal rates will materially offset such increase. 
 
 Subsequent Real Estate Acquisitions 
 As of November 4, 2024 and d uring the period s ubsequent to September 30, 2024, we have acquired 13 properties in individual or portfolio transactions for an aggregate of approximately 4.2 million, excluding closing costs.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at both fixed and variable rates. As of September 30, 2024 , our indebtedness was approximately 278.3 million , consisting of approximately 244.0 million of variable-rate debt and approximately 34.3 million of fixed-rate debt. Of the 244.0 million variable-rate debt, 200.0 million relates to the Term Loans, which have been fixed through the Interest Rate Swaps. When factoring in the Term Loans as fixed-rate debt through the Interest Rate Swaps, as of September 30, 2024 , approximately 44.0 million of our indebtedness was variable-rate debt and approximately 234.3 million was fixed-rate debt. Assuming no increase in the amount of our outstanding variable-rate indebtedness, if the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR were to increase or decrease by 1.0 , our cash flows would decrease or increase by approximately 0.4 million on an annualized basis. 
 
 Subject to maintaining our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we manage our market risk on variable rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps that fix the rate on all or a portion of our variable rate debt for varying periods up to maturity, such as the Interest Rate Swaps. In the future, we may use other derivative instruments such as interest cap agreements to, in effect, cap the interest rate on all or a portion of the debt for varying periods up to maturity. This in turn, reduces the risks of variability of cash flows created by variable rate debt and mitigates the risk of increases in interest rates. Our objective when undertaking such arrangements will be to reduce our floating rate exposure. However, we provide no assurance that our efforts to manage interest rate volatility will successfully mitigate the risks of such volatility in our portfolio and we do not intend to enter into hedging arrangements for speculative purposes. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (i) is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
