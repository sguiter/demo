 DOGWOOD THERAPEUTICS, INC. Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited) segment and is a pre-revenue, development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new medicines to treat pain and fatigue-related disorders. The Dogwood research pipeline is focused on two separate mechanistic pillars; NaV 1.7 modulation to treat chronic and acute pain disorders and combination antiviral therapies targeting reactivated herpes virus mediated illnesses. The proprietary non-opioid, NaV 1.7 analgesic program is centered on our lead development candidate Halneuron . Halneuron is a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, a mechanism known to be effective for reducing pain. Halneuron treatment has demonstrated pain reduction of both general cancer related pain and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain CINP ). Our forthcoming Halneuron Phase 2b study will commence in Q1 2025. The antiviral program includes IMC-1 and IMC-2, which are novel, proprietary, fixed dose combinations of nucleoside analog, anti-herpes antivirals and the anti-inflammatory agent, celecoxib for the treatment of fibromyalgia FM and Long-COVID LC ). Top-line data from an ongoing IMC-2 Phase 2 LC study are expected in November 2024. IMC-1 is poised to progress into Phase 3 development as a treatment for FM and is the focus of external partnership activities. Going Concern Since its founding, the Company has been engaged in research and development activities, as well as organizational activities, including raising capital. The Company has not generated any revenues to date. As such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with any development-stage biotechnology company that has substantial expenditures for research and development. Since inception, the Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operating activities. The Company has funded its losses primarily through issuance of members interests, convertible debt instruments and issuance of equity securities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred net losses of and , respectively, and and , respectively, and had net cash outflows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of and is expected to incur losses in the future as it continues its development activities. In September 2022, the Company announced the top line results from its FORTRESS study in FM. Overall, the FORTRESS study did not achieve statistical significance on the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to Week 14 in the weekly average of daily self-reported average pain severity scores comparing IMC-1 to placebo (p=0.302). However, based on post-hoc analysis of the FORTRESS data, new FM research patients who have not participated in prior FM clinical trials demonstrated statistically significant improvement on the primary endpoint of reduction in FM related pain versus placebo, irrespective of when they enrolled in the study. The Company believes focusing the forward development of IMC-1 on these new

 million. On October 7, 2024, the Company received million in loan proceeds with an additional million expected to be received in February 2025 under a Loan Agreement as described in Note 11 Subsequent Events in these Notes to condensed financial statements. Based on current projections, and assuming we secure the anticipated million of additional loan proceeds under the Loan Agreement, we believe we will have sufficient capital to fund operations until the end of 2025. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates and the risks associated with the research, development, and commercialization of biotechnology products, we may have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. As of the issuance date of these condensed financial statements, cash is not sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Dogwood will need to secure the million in additional loan proceeds in February 2025 to fund its operations through the end of 2025 and will require additional financing to fund its ongoing clinical trials and operations beyond 2025 to continue to execute its strategy. Management plans to explore various dilutive and non-dilutive sources of funding, including equity financings, debt financings, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives. There is no assurance that such financings will be available when needed or on acceptable terms. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to operate as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of these condensed financial statements. The condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to reflect this uncertainty. Nasdaq Listing As previously reported, on November 2, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that, for the previous consecutive business days, the bid price for the Company s common stock, par value per share Common Stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). The letter stated that the Company had calendar days, or until April 30, 2024 to regain compliance such that the closing bid price for the Company s Common Stock is at least for a minimum of consecutive business days.

 Overview We are a pre-revenue, development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new medicines to treat pain and fatigue-related disorders. Our pipeline is focused on two separate mechanistic pillars; NaV 1.7 modulation to treat chronic and acute pain disorders and combination antiviral therapies targeting reactivated herpes virus mediated illnesses. The proprietary non-opioid, NaV 1.7 analgesic program is centered on our lead development candidate Halneuron . Halneuron is a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, a mechanism known to be effective for reducing pain. Halneuron treatment has demonstrated pain reduction of both general cancer related pain and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain CINP ). Our forthcoming Halneuron Phase 2b study will commence in Q1 2025. The antiviral program includes IMC-1 and IMC-2, which are novel, proprietary, fixed dose combinations of nucleoside analog, anti-herpes antivirals and the anti-inflammatory agent, celecoxib for the treatment of fibromyalgia FM and Long-COVID LC ). Top-line data from an ongoing IMC-2 Phase 2 LC study are expected in November 2024. IMC-1 is poised to progress into Phase 3 development as a treatment for FM and is the focus of external partnership activities. Following the closing of the Combination described below in which we acquired Pharmagesic (Holdings) Inc. on October 7, 2024, we have a pipeline of assets with significant value creation potential.

 The following chart reflects our current pipeline and the development stage of each product candidate. We plan to advance the development of the following clinical programs over the next twelve months: NaV 1.7 Non-opioid Analgesic Program We plan to develop Halneuron , which was acquired as part of the Combination. Halneuron is a proven sodium channel blocker known to be effective for pain relief. Halneuron is currently in Phase 2b development for CINP and anticipated to have an interim efficacy readout in 2H of 2025. Halneuron has completed a Phase 2 study (n=165) in cancer related pain CRP whereby patients were randomized to Halneuron or placebo in a multicenter trial to test for efficacy and safety of Halneuron for moderate to severe inadequately controlled CRP. The results were statistically significant based on a pain reduction endpoint and some patients demonstrated pain relief for more than 30 days post the injection period. Halneuron showed an acceptable safety profile in cancer patients. Halneuron has also completed a Phase 2a signal seeking study (n=125) in chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain CINP ), whereby patients were randomized to three doses of Halneuron and two dose regiments or placebo. The purpose of this study was to identify the dose and regimen for a Phase 2b study in CINP. The results of this study showed that Halneuron high doses delivered greater pain reduction as compared to low doses, that QD dosing was comparable to BID dosing in terms of pain reduction, and that low doses were better tolerated. The FDA has granted Halneuron fast track status for the treatment of CINP. Antiviral Program We plan to continue development of IMC-1 and IMC-2 which are novel, proprietary, fixed dose combinations of nucleoside analog, anti-herpes antivirals and the anti-inflammatory agent, celecoxib. IMC-1 is a novel combination of famciclovir and celecoxib intended to synergistically suppress herpesvirus activation and replication, with the end goal of reducing viral mediated disease burden. IMC-2 is a combination of valacyclovir and celecoxib that like IMC-1, is intended to synergistically suppress herpesvirus activation and replication with a more specific activity against the Epstein-Barr virus (herpesvirus HHV-4).

 IMC-1 is a Phase 3 ready asset for the treatment of FM. The Company and the FDA have agreed upon the Phase 3 program requirements for IMC-1, which includes a pharmacokinetic/food effect study, a head-to-head twelve week study of IMC-1 versus placebo, a multifactorial twelve week study of IMC-1 versus placebo, versus famciclovir versus celecoxib and a long-term extension study. We are exploring Phase 3 development partnership opportunities, inclusive of advancing the development of an IMC-1 extended-release dosage formulation to extend intellectual property IP for this asset. IMC-2 has been studied in an exploratory, open-label, proof of concept study in LC funded by an unrestricted grant provided to the Bateman Horne Center BHC by the Company. BHC is a non-profit, interdisciplinary Center of Excellence advancing the diagnosis and treatment of chronic fatigue disorders including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, FM, post-viral syndromes, and related comorbidities. BHC enrolled female patients diagnosed with LC illness, otherwise known as PASC. Patients treated with a combination of Val/Cel, as well as routine care, exhibited clinically and statistically significant improvements in fatigue, pain, and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction as well as ratings of general well-being related to LC when treated open-label for 14 weeks, as compared to a control cohort of female LC patients matched by age and length of illness and treated with routine care only. The statistically significant improvements in PASC symptoms and general health status were particularly encouraging given that the majority of patients in the study had been vaccinated for the COVID-19 virus and the mean duration of LC illness was two years for both the treated and control cohort prior to enrollment in this study. IMC-2 is currently being studied in a second LC study (n=45) conducted by BHC through an unrestricted grant provided by the Company. The results from this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study is expected in November 2024. We have clarity from the FDA on the development requirements associated with advancing IMC-2 into Phase 2b development as a treatment for LC symptoms. Assuming the results of this study show a positive signal, we plan to explore various dilutive and non-dilutive sources of capital to fund a Phase 2b study. The Company has filed new IP with protection potential to 2044. Share Exchange Agreement On October 7, 2024, the Company, entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement with Sealbond Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation Sealbond ), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding common shares of Pharmagesic (Holdings) Inc., a Canadian corporation Pharmagesic and the parent company of Wex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (such transaction, the Combination ).

The increase of 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher legal and professional fees related to the Pharmagesic acquisition in October 2024 of 1.0 million offset by lower insurance expenses associated with being a public company of 0.4 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, the Company has not generated revenues, has incurred losses and has experienced negative cash flows from operations. The Company incurred net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, of 2,280,684 and 4,621,852, respectively, and 1,235,074 and 4,192,842, respectively. The Company s operating activities used 2,659,297 and 3,401,318 of net cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 66,091,074 and cash of 2,039,819. On October 7, 2024, in connection with the Combination described above, we received 16,500,000 in loan proceeds with an additional 3,000,000 expected in February 2025. Based on current projections, and assuming we secure the anticipated 3,000,000 of additional loan proceeds under the Loan Agreement, we believe we will have sufficient capital to fund operations until the end of 2025. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates and the risks associated with the research, development, and commercialization of biotechnology products, we may have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. As of the issuance date of these condensed financial statements, cash is not sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Dogwood will need to secure the 3,000,000 in addition loan proceeds in February 2025 to fund its operations through the end of 2025 and will require additional financing to fund its ongoing clinical trials and operations beyond 2025 to continue to execute its strategy. Management plans to explore various dilutive and non-dilutive sources of funding, including equity financings, debt financings, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives. There is no assurance that such financings will be available when needed or on acceptable terms. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to operate as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of these condensed financial statements. The condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to reflect this uncertainty. The global economy, including credit and financial markets, has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates and uncertainty about economic stability. For example, the ongoing conflicts between Israel-Hamas and Ukraine-Russia, the effect of these wars and the resulting sanctions by the U.S. and European governments, has created extreme volatility in the global capital markets and is expected to have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets. Any such volatility and disruptions may have adverse consequences on us or the third parties on whom we rely. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Equity Financings On May 22, 2024, we closed a public offering raising gross proceeds of 1.7 million and net proceeds of approximately 1.4 million, after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. In July 2023, we entered into a Capital on Demand TM Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC JonesTrading under which we could issue and sale shares of our Common Stock, from time to time, through JonesTrading, acting as sales agent or principal, up to an aggregate offering price of up to 6,700,000 in which is commonly referred to as an at-the-market ATM program. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 25,675 shares of our Common Stock under the 

 28 

Table of Contents 
 ATM program at a weighted-average gross sales price of approximately 52.78 per share and raised 1,355,090 of gross proceeds. The total commissions and related legal and accounting fees were approximately 198,650, and we received net proceeds of approximately 1,156,440. In August 2023, we terminated the Sales Agreement. Debt Financings There were no debt financings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There was no debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Future Capital Requirements We estimate our current cash of 2.0 million at September 30, 2024 along with the loan proceeds received on October 7, 2024 of 16.5 million under terms of the Loan Agreement after September 30, 2024 is not sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. We plan to secure the additional 3.0 million of loan proceeds available to us under the terms of the Loan Agreement in February 2025 to continue to fund our operations through 2025 but will require additional financing to fund its ongoing clinical trials and operations beyond 2025 to continue to execute its strategy. We plan to raise additional capital to continue clinical development of our product candidates. We will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders will experience dilution. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs. Failure to secure the necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company s strategy and value and could require the delay of product development and clinical trial plans. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect this uncertainty. Summary of Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Unaudited) Statement of Cash Flows Data: Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (2,659,297) (3,401,318) Financing activities 1,382,170 1,156,443 Decrease in cash (1,277,127) (2,244,875) Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operating Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operations was 2.6 million and consisted of a net loss of 4.6 million offset by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 1.6 million attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 1.0 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 0.6 million and non-cash items of 0.4 million attributable to share-based compensation.

Table of Contents 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operations was 3.4 million and consisted of a net loss of 4.2 million offset by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 0.3 million attributable to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 0.6 million offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 0.9 million and non-cash items of 0.5 million attributable to share-based compensation. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.4 million and was attributable to cash proceeds from our public offering in May 2024, net of placement agent fees and offering costs. Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.2 million and was attributable to proceeds from the issuance and sale of Common Stock under the ATM program, net of commissions and other related expenses. In addition, there were 19,145 warrants cashless exercised. As a result, 7,718 shares of Common Stock were surrendered at fair value to satisfy the exercise price and 11,427 shares of Common Stock were issued. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgements and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to use judgment in making certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments by management in order to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which we included in our 2023 Amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A. JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company. As an emerging growth company, we are electing to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth

 anniversary of the completion of our IPO or until we no longer meet the requirements for being an emerging growth company, whichever occurs first. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk This item is not required for smaller reporting companies. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules, regulations and forms of the SEC, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated by and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time we may be involved in claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly and time consuming, and it can divert management s attention from important business matters and initiatives, negatively impacting our overall operations. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently have any pending or ongoing litigation to which we are a party or to which our property is subject that we believe to be material. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the following risk factors, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The following risk factors and the risks described in our 2023 Amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Risk Factors Relating to the Combination There is no guarantee that the Combination will increase stockholder value. In October 2024, we consummated the Combination. We cannot guarantee that implementing the Combination and related transactions will not impair stockholder value or otherwise adversely affect our business. The Combination poses significant integration challenges between our businesses and employees which could result in management and business disruptions, any of which could harm our results of operation, business prospects, and impair the value of the Combination to our stockholders. Tetrodotoxin and Halneuron may become subject to a contractual repurchase right in certain circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In connection with the Combination, we agreed to enter into a Repurchase Agreement with Sealbond upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, pursuant to which Sealbond has the right to acquire all of the Company s and its direct and indirect subsidiaries intellectual property, rights, title, regulatory submissions, assignment of contracts, data and interests, as of the time of such acquisition, in and to tetrodotoxin and Halneuron (the Repurchase Option in exchange for the aggregate cash settlement amount Sealbond would then be entitled to under the Certificate of Designation. In the event that the Repurchase Option is exercised, the Company may experience the loss of a key asset and product development program, and reduced long-term product development and marketing opportunities for the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock, our results of operations and financial condition. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, we are required to recommend that our stockholders approve the conversion of all outstanding shares of our Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our Common Stock. We cannot guarantee that our stockholders will approve this matter. Under the terms of the Exchange Agreement, we agreed to call and hold a meeting of our stockholders to obtain, among other things, the requisite approvals for the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock to be issued in the Combination into shares of our Common Stock and to seek approval of a potential change of control under Nasdaq Listing Rules 5110 and 5635(C), in each case as required by the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC listing rules. If such approval is not obtained at that meeting, the 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 Company agreed to seek to obtain such approvals at an annual or special stockholders meeting to be held at least every six months thereafter until such approval is obtained, which would be time consuming and costly. We may be required to settle shares of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The Certificate of Designation provides that if Company fails to deliver to the holders of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock certificates or electronic entries representing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock and certain events set forth in the Exchange Agreement occur, each share of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock will be settled for cash at the option of the holder at a price per share equal to the then-current fair value of a share of Common Stock. If we are required to cash settle a significant amount of Series A Preferred Stock, we may not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Combination commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Combination, including the issuance of our Common Stock upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock issued in the Combination. If we are unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Combination, stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in the Company without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent we are able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Combination. The failure to successfully integrate the businesses of the Company and Pharmagesic in the expected timeframe would adversely affect Dogwood s future results. Our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the Company and Pharmagesic will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the Combination. If we are not able to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the Combination may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common shares may be adversely affected. In addition, the integration of the Company s and Pharmagesic s respective businesses will be a time-consuming and expensive process. Proper planning and effective and timely implementation will be critical to avoid any significant disruption to Dogwood s operations. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of its ongoing business or the identification of inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect its ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, creditors, lessors, clinical trial investigators or managers or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Combination. Delays encountered in the integration process could have a material adverse effect on Dogwood s expenses, operating results and financial condition, including the value of shares of its Common Stock. Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations. As a result of the Combination, we will become a more diversified company and our business will become more complex. There can be no assurance that we will effectively manage the increased complexity without experiencing operating inefficiencies or control deficiencies. Significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage our increased complexity and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, as a result of the Combination, our financial statements and results of operations for periods prior to October 7, 2024 may not provide meaningful guidance to form an assessment of the prospects or potential success of our future business operations.

 We expect to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Pharmagesic. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial expenses in connection with the Combination and the integration of Pharmagesic. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, billing, payroll, research and development, marketing and benefits. Both the Company and Pharmagesic have incurred significant transaction expenses in connection with the drafting and negotiation of the Exchange Agreement, and the related ancillary agreements. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration expenses likely will result in our taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the Combination, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company adopted or terminated any Rule b -1 trading arrangement or non-Rule b -1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Company acknowledges that (i) the Rights Agent is not a bank or a trust company, (ii) the Rights Agent is not acting in any sort of capacity as an escrow or similar agent hereunder, and (iii) nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Rights Agent to perform any services that would require registration with any Governmental Body as a bank or a trust company.

To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Company or the Rights Agent, as the case 

 6 

may be, and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 (e) If any CVR Payment (or portion thereof) remains unclaimed by a Holder two (2) years after the applicable Calendar Quarter end (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which such CVR Payment would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body), such CVR Payment (or portion thereof) will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Company and will be transferred to the Company or a person nominated in writing by the Company (with written notice thereof from the Company to the Rights Agent), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto, and no consideration or compensation shall be payable therefor. Neither the Company nor the Rights Agent will be liable to any Person in respect of a CVR Payment delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar legal requirement under applicable Law.
 Section 2.5 No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest .

 (d) It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the CVRs and the possibility of any payment hereunder with respect thereto are highly speculative and subject to numerous factors outside of the Company s control, and there is no assurance that Holders will receive any payments under this Agreement or in connection with the CVRs. Each Holder acknowledges that it is highly possible that no Upfront Payment or Milestone Payment will occur and that there will not be any CVR Payment Amount. It is further acknowledged and agreed that neither the Company nor its Affiliates owe, by virtue of their obligations under this Agreement, a fiduciary duty or any implied duties to the Holders and the parties hereto, and the Company and its Affiliates intend solely the express provisions of this Agreement to govern their contractual relationship with respect to the CVRs. It is acknowledged and agreed that this Section 2.5(d) is an essential and material term of this Agreement.
 Section 2.6 Ability to Abandon CVR . A Holder may at any time, at such Holder s option, abandon all of such Holder s remaining rights represented by CVRs by transferring such CVRs to the Company or a Person nominated in writing by the Company (with written notice thereof from the Company to the Rights Agent) without consideration in compensation therefor, and such rights will be 

 7 

cancelled, with the Rights Agent being promptly notified in writing by the Holder of such transfer and cancellation.
