Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Executive Summary 
 Overview 
 TriNet is a leading provider of comprehensive and flexible HCM solutions designed to address a wide range of SMB needs as they change over time. Our flexible HCM solutions free SMBs from HR complexities and empower SMBs to focus on what matters most - growing their business and enabling their people. 
 TriNet offers access to human capital expertise, benefits, payroll, risk mitigation and compliance, all enabled by industry leading technology capabilities. TriNet's suite of products also includes services and software-based solutions to help streamline workflows by connecting HR, benefits, payroll, time and attendance, and employee engagement. Clients can use our industry tailored PEO services and technology platform to receive the full benefit of our HCM services enabling their WSEs to participate in our TriNet-sponsored employee benefit plans.

By providing PEO and HRIS services, we believe that we can support a wider range of SMBs and create a pipeline of HRIS clients that may be able to benefit from and transition to TriNet s higher-touch PEO services at future points in their business lifecycle. In order to better serve TriNet s customers throughout their business lifecycle, we are investing in our technology platform so that it can accommodate both PEO and HRIS customers. 
 Operational Highlights 
 Our consolidated results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect our continuing efforts to serve our clients, attract new clients and invest in our platform.

 Our results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods of 2023, are noted below:

See definitions below under the heading " Non-GAAP Financial Measures ". 
 Total WSEs and Average WSEs include incremental WSEs that were charged a platform user access fee and incremental additional service recipients. These were identified as a result of our ongoing effort to ensure that our billing practices best match the expectations of our customers. For details, refer to the heading "Operating Metrics Worksite Employees (WSEs). 
 
 Our total revenues increased 1 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by higher Average co-employed WSEs and rate increases, partially offset by lower HRIS revenue. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, our Average WSEs and Total WSEs increased 7 and 6 , respectively, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to additional PEO Platform Users and additional service recipients identified as a result of our ongoing effort to ensure that our billing practices best match the expectations of our customers. 
 Our ICR was 6 points higher compared to the same period in 2023, driven by a shift in more severe medical service utilization, higher rates paid for outpatient services, and increasing specialty drug utilization. Our increase in ICR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 set forth in the table below was partially offset by favorable workers' compensation prior period claims development during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Higher insurance costs and interest expense, partially offset by higher revenues and lower operating expenses, resulted in decreases of net income and Adjusted Net income of 52 and 46 , respectively, as compared to the same period in 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, we monitor other non-GAAP financial measures that we use to manage our business, to make planning decisions, to allocate resources and to use as performance measures in our executive compensation plan. These key financial measures provide an additional view of our operational performance over the long-term and provide information that we use to maintain and grow our business. 
 The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is used to enhance the understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance. It is not meant to be considered in isolation from, superior to, or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Non-GAAP Measure Definition How We Use The Measure 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Net income, excluding the effects of: 
 - income tax provision, 
 - interest expense, bank fees and other, 
 - depreciation, 
 - amortization of intangible assets, 
 - stock based compensation expense, 
 - amortization of cloud computing arrangements, and 
 - transaction and integration costs. 
 Provides period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis and an understanding as to how our management evaluates the effectiveness of our business strategies by excluding certain non-recurring costs, which include transaction and integration costs, as well as certain non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation and certain impairment charges recognized based on the estimated fair values. We believe these charges are either not directly resulting from our core operations or not indicative of our ongoing operations. Enhances comparisons to the prior period and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. Provides a measure, among others, used in the determination of incentive compensation for management. We also sometimes refer to Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues. Adjusted Net Income 
 Net income, excluding the effects of: 
 - effective income tax rate (1) , 
 - stock based compensation, 
 - amortization of intangible assets, net, 
 - non-cash interest expense, 
 - transaction and integration costs, and 
 - the income tax effect (at our effective tax rate (1) of these pre-tax adjustments. 
 Provides information to our stockholders and board of directors to understand how our management evaluates our business, to monitor and evaluate our operating results, and analyze profitability of our ongoing operations and trends on a consistent basis by excluding certain non-cash charges. Corporate Operating Cash Flows Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, excluding the effects of: - Assets associated with WSEs and TriNet Trust (accounts receivable, unbilled revenue, prepaid expenses, other payroll assets and other current assets) and - Liabilities associated with WSEs and TriNet Trust (client deposits and other client liabilities, accrued wages, payroll tax liabilities and other payroll withholdings, accrued health insurance costs, accrued workers' compensation costs, insurance premiums and other payables, and other current liabilities). Provides information that our stockholders and management can use to evaluate our cash flows from operations independent of the current assets and liabilities associated with our WSEs and TriNet Trust. Enhances comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, used as a liquidity measure to manage liquidity between corporate and WSE and TriNet Trust related activities, and to help determine and plan our cash flow and capital strategies. 
 
 (1) Non-GAAP effective tax rate is 25.6 for 2024 and 2023, which excludes the income tax impact from stock-based compensation, changes in uncertain tax positions, and nonrecurring benefits or expenses from federal legislative changes.

Operating Metrics 
 Worksite Employees (WSE) 
 Average WSE change is a volume measure we use to monitor the performance of our PEO business. Our PEO clients generally change their payroll service providers at the beginning of the payroll tax and benefits enrollment year; as a result, we have historically experienced our highest volumes of new PEO clients joining and existing clients terminating in the month of January. PEO client attrition, new PEO client additions and changes in employment levels within our installed PEO client base all impact our Average WSEs and Total WSEs as we move through a calendar year. 
 We support WSEs from the date on which their co-employment with TriNet commences through the end of their co-employment with TriNet and also after their co-employment period. We define WSEs to include co-employees and other individuals receiving PEO services, such as individuals who receive COBRA benefits post co-employment or are subject to partnership tax reporting as well as individuals who utilize our PEO platform on behalf of TriNet PEO clients. As part of an ongoing effort to ensure that our billing practices best match the expectations of our customers, in the third quarter of 2023 we determined that certain individuals such as those described above and certain co-employees were not previously or consistently counted in Total WSEs and Average WSEs. This resulting adjustment is reflected in Total WSEs for both September 30, 2024 and 2023, and increased Average WSEs by approximately 5,500 for the third quarter of 2024 and 5,400 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We intend to continue our ongoing effort to ensure that our billing practices best match the services we provide and the expectations of our customers and in the future we may identify additional individuals that should be included in Total WSEs and Average WSEs. 
 In December 2023, we implemented a platform user access fee to charge clients for those users of our PEO platform that may not be co-employed by us and to charge clients for co-employees for whom payroll may not be regularly run. In addition to co-employees for whom payroll may not be regularly run, such as partners in a partnership, this also includes individuals authorized by our clients to access and use the PEO platform for functions such as bookkeeping and benefits management. The amount of the fee is comparable to the fee we charge for users of our HRIS platform. While the amount of revenue we recognized for this service to date has not been significant, these users of the PEO platform for whose access we charged this fee increased our reported Total WSEs by approximately 22,100 as of September 30, 2024 and Average WSEs by approximately 19,900 for the third quarter of 2024 and 18,700 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The effect of this new fee is that we are now receiving revenue from two types of users on our PEO platform, those that are co-employed in our PEO business and those that are utilizing our PEO platform, albeit in a more limited capacity. The table below illustrates how those two components comprise our Total WSE and Average WSE metrics.

 Average WSEs increased 7 when comparing the third quarter of 2024 to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the additional co-employed and PEO platform users described above. From a vertical perspective, declines in our Technology, Professional Services and Life Sciences verticals were largely offset by increases in our Main Street, Financial Services and Non-Profit verticals. 
 Total WSEs can be used to estimate our beginning WSEs for the next period and, as a result, can be used as an indicator of our potential future success in generating revenue, growing our business and retaining clients. Total WSEs increased 6 when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the additional PEO platform Users WSEs described above. 
 TRINET 13 
 2024 Q3 FORM 10-Q 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Table of Contents 

Anticipated revenues for future periods can diverge from the revenue expectation derived from Average WSEs or Total WSEs due to pricing differences across our HCM solutions and services and the degree to which clients and WSEs elect to participate in our solutions during future periods. In addition to focusing on growing our Average WSE and Total WSE counts, we also focus on pricing strategies, benefit participation and service differentiation to expand the value we provide to our clients and our resulting revenue opportunities. We report the impact of client and WSE participation differences as a change in mix. 
 We continue to invest in efforts intended to enhance client experience, improve our new sales performance, and manage client attrition, through product development as well as operational and process improvements. As we continue our work in combining our PEO platform and our HRIS SaaS capabilities into a single platform, these various types of TriNet users will all be served from the same platform. In addition to focusing on retaining and growing our WSE base, we continue to review acquisition opportunities that would expand our product offering and provide further scale. 

HRIS Users 
 
 Average HRIS Users is a volume measure we use to monitor the performance of our cloud-based HRIS services. Average HRIS Users for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, was 183,410, and 210,863, respectively. Average HRIS Users for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 189,929, and 219,058, respectively. This decline is primarily driven by client attrition outpacing new client additions in addition to decreased staffing by HRIS clients similar to SMB trends that we have observed in our PEO business. 
 
 Insurance Cost Ratio (ICR) 
 ICR is a performance measure calculated as the ratio of insurance costs to insurance service revenues. We believe that ICR promotes an understanding of our insurance cost trends and our ability to align our relative pricing to risk performance. 
 We purchase workers' compensation and health benefits coverage for our WSEs. Under the insurance policies for this coverage, we bear claims costs up to a defined deductible amount. Our insurance costs, which comprise a significant portion of our overall costs, are significantly affected by our WSEs health and workers' compensation insurance claims experience. We set our insurance service fees for workers compensation and health benefits in advance for fixed benefit periods. As a result, any increases in insurance costs above our projections, will be reflected as a higher ICR, and result in lower net income. Any decreases in insurance costs below our projections, will be reflected as a lower ICR and result in higher net income. 
 TRINET 14 
 2024 Q3 FORM 10-Q 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Table of Contents 

Under our fully-insured workers' compensation insurance policies, we assume the risk for losses up to 1 million per claim occurrence (deductible layer). The ultimate cost of the workers compensation services provided cannot be known until all the claims are settled. Our ability to predict these costs is limited by unexpected increases in frequency or severity of claims, which can vary due to changes in the cost of treatments or claim settlements. 
 Under our risk-based health insurance policies, we assume the risk of variability in future health claims costs for our enrollees. This variability typically results from changing trends in the volume, severity and ultimate cost of medical and pharmaceutical claims, due to changes to the components of medical cost trend, which we define as changes in participant use of services, including the introduction of new treatment options, changes in treatment guidelines and mandates, and changes in the mix, cost of providing treatment and timing of services provided to plan participants. These trends change, and other seasonal trends and variability may develop. As a result, it is difficult for us to predict our insurance costs with accuracy and a significant increase in these costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.

 ICR increased for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by higher insurance costs outpacing the growth in ISR. Insurance costs increased due to more severe medical service utilization, higher rates paid for outpatient services, as well as increased specialty medications for diabetes and obesity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this was partially offset by favorable prior period development in workers' compensation. 
 
 Total Revenues 
 Our revenues consist of PSR and ISR. PSR represents fees charged to clients for processing payroll-related transactions on behalf of our PEO and HRIS clients, access to our HR expertise and technology, employment and benefit law compliance services, other HR-related and tax credit filing services and fees charged to access our cloud-based HRIS services. ISR consists of insurance-related billings and administrative fees collected from PEO clients and withheld from WSEs for workers' compensation insurance and health benefit insurance plans provided by third-party insurance carriers. 
 Monthly revenues per co-employed Average WSE is a measure we use to monitor our PEO pricing strategies. This measure increased by 1 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 We also use the following measures to further analyze changes in total revenue: 
 Volume - the percentage change in period over period co-employed Average WSEs, 
 Rate - the combined weighted average percentage changes in service fees for each vertical service and changes in service fees associated with each insurance service offering, 
 Mix - the change in composition of co-employed Average WSEs within our verticals combined with the composition of our enrolled co-employed WSEs within our insurance service offerings and the composition of products and services our clients receive, including TriNet Clarus R+D and PEO Platform Users, and 
 HRIS - incremental HRIS cloud services revenue.

PSR ISR - represents proportion of insurance service revenues to total revenues Total revenues generated from PEO services only 

The increase in total revenue for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher co-employed Average WSEs and rate increases, partially offset by lower HRIS revenue and slightly lower health plan enrollment. 
 
 Operating Income 
 Our operating income consists of total revenues less insurance costs and OE. Our insurance costs include insurance premiums for coverage provided by insurance carriers, expenses for claims costs and risk management and administrative services, and changes in accrued costs related to contractual obligations with our workers' compensation and health benefit carriers. Our OE consists primarily of our colleagues' compensation related expenses, which includes payroll, payroll taxes, SBC, bonuses, commissions and other payroll-and benefits-related costs.

Professional Service Revenues 
 Our PEO and HRIS clients are primarily billed on a fee per WSE or HRIS User per month per transaction. Our vertical approach provides us the flexibility to offer our PEO clients in different industries with varied services at different prices, which we believe potentially reduces the value of solely using Average WSE and Total WSE counts as indicators of future potential revenue performance. 
 PSR from PEO Services customers and HRIS cloud services clients was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 PEO Services 174 168 552 527 HRIS Cloud Services

 We also analyze changes in PSR with the following measures: 
 Volume - the percentage change in period over period co-employed Average WSEs, 
 Rate - the weighted average percentage change in fees for each vertical, 
 Mix - the change in composition of co-employed Average WSEs across our verticals and the composition of products and services our clients receive, including TriNet Clarus R+D and PEO Platform Users, and 
 HRIS - incremental HRIS cloud services revenue. 

PSR for the third quarter was flat compared to prior period. The increase in PSR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by higher co-employed Average WSEs and rate increases. The decrease in HRIS revenue compared to the prior periods was primarily due to an acceleration of revenue in 2023 related to a termination agreement in a broker partner which did not recur in 2024.

The lower interest income for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to holding less cash and investments as we executed on a significant amount of stock buybacks over the past year, including a public tender offer in the third quarter of 2023, and began paying quarterly dividends. The higher interest expense, bank fees and other for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the additional interest on our 2031 Notes issued in the third quarter of 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to access sufficient cash flows to meet the short-term and long-term cash requirements of our business operations. Our principal source of liquidity for operations is derived from cash provided by operating activities. We rely on cash provided by operating activities to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, which primarily relate to the payment of corporate payroll and other operating costs, and capital expenditures. Our cash flow related to WSE payroll and benefits is generally matched by advance collection from our PEO clients. To minimize the credit risk associated with remitting the payroll and associated taxes and benefits costs, we require PEO clients to prefund the payroll and related payroll taxes and benefits costs. 
 Included in our balance sheets are assets and liabilities resulting from transactions directly or indirectly associated with WSEs, including payroll and related taxes and withholdings, our sponsored workers' compensation and health insurance programs, and other benefit programs. Although we are not subject to regulatory restrictions that require us to do so, we distinguish and manage our corporate assets and liabilities separately from those current assets and liabilities held by us to satisfy our employer obligations associated with our WSEs. 
 In December of 2023, TriNet created a trust for the purpose of holding funds provided by HRIS clients for the remittance to HRIS Users, tax authorities and other recipients. This trust is consolidated into our financial statements. During the first quarter of 2024, TriNet Trust assumed ownership and responsibility of certain bank accounts that hold HRIS client funds. The associated cash is reflected on our balance sheet as restricted cash and the associated liabilities are classified as accrued wages, payroll tax liabilities and other payroll withholdings, and client deposits and other client liabilities and assumed related liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of restricted cash in TriNet Trust was 81 million. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, we include the assets and liabilities related to the TriNet Trust in the "WSE TriNet Trust" category because the underlying cash flows of TriNet Trust are related to the same type of payroll and payroll related liabilities as our WSE cash flows.

 As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 Working capital for WSEs and TriNet Trust related activities 
 We designate funds to ensure that we have adequate current assets to satisfy our current obligations associated with WSEs. We manage our WSE payroll and benefits obligations through collections of payments from our clients which generally occur two to three days in advance of client payroll dates. We regularly review our short-term obligations associated with our WSEs (such as payroll and related taxes, insurance premium and claim payments) and designate funds required to fulfill these short-term obligations, which we refer to as PFC. PFC is included in current assets as restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments. 
 We manage our sponsored benefit and workers' compensation insurance obligations by maintaining collateral funds in restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments. These collateral amounts are generally determined at the beginning of each plan year and we may be required by our insurance carriers to adjust our collateral balances when facts and circumstances change. We regularly review our collateral balances with our insurance carriers and anticipate funding further collateral in the future based upon our capital requirements. We classify our restricted

cash, cash equivalents and investments as current and noncurrent assets to match against the anticipated timing of payments to carriers. 
 Working capital for corporate purposes 
 Corporate working capital as of September 30, 2024 increased 50 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to the decreases in our corporate current liabilities. 
 We use our available cash and cash equivalents to satisfy our operational and regulatory requirements and to fund capital expenditures. We believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from corporate operating activities and the potential issuance of debt or equity securities. We hold both corporate cash and cash associated with WSEs across multiple financial institutions to reduce concentrations of counterparty risk. We believe our existing corporate cash and cash equivalents and positive working capital will be sufficient to meet our working capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months.

 The year-over-year change in net cash used in operating activities for WSE TriNet Trust purposes was primarily driven by timing of client payments, payments of payroll and payroll taxes and insurance claim activities. We expect the changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents to correspond to WSE TriNet Trust cash provided by (or used in) operations as we manage our obligations associated with WSEs and HRIS Users through restricted cash. 
 Our corporate operating cash flows in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the decrease in our net income and the timing of our payments of corporate obligations.

These investments are classified on our balance sheets as restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments. We review the amount and the anticipated holding period of these investments regularly in conjunction with our estimated long-term workers' compensation liabilities and anticipated claims payment trend. At September 30, 2024, our investments had a weighted average duration of less than two years and an average S P credit rating of AA.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Table of Contents 

On August 28, 2023, we completed a public tender offer through which we repurchased 5,981,308 shares of common stock at a price of 107.00 per share, for total consideration of approximately 640 million. On September 13, 2023, we repurchased 3,364,486 shares of common stock at a price of 107.00 per share, for total consideration of approximately 360 million, through a private repurchase from our largest stockholder, Atairos Group, Inc. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,455,515 shares of our common stock for approximately 154 million through our existing stock repurchase program in addition to 58,636 shares acquired to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to SBC vesting. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 279 million remained available for repurchase under all authorizations by our board of directors. We plan to use current cash and cash generated from ongoing operating activities to fund this stock repurchase program. 
 In February 2024, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0.25 per share, for a total payment of approximately 13 million, which was paid in April 2024. In June 2024, our board of directors authorized a dividend of 0.25 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately 12 million, which was paid in July 2024. In September 2024, our board of directors authorized a dividend of 0.25 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately 12 million, to be paid in October 2024. 
 Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, 500 million and 400 million aggregate principal of our 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes was outstanding, respectively. The indenture governing our 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes each includes restrictive covenants limiting our ability to: (i) create liens on certain assets to secure debt; (ii) grant a subsidiary guarantee of certain debt without also providing a guarantee of the 2029 Notes or 2031 Notes, as applicable; and (iii) consolidate or merge with or into, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, another person, subject, in each case, to certain customary exceptions. 
 Our 2021 Credit Agreement includes a 700 million revolver. In September of 2023, we drew down 200 million of this revolver to partially fund our third quarter of 2023 share repurchases. The 2021 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness and liens, sell assets and make restricted payments, including dividends and investments, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the 2021 Credit Agreement also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The 2021 Credit Agreement also contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain certain maximum total net leverage ratios. 
 We were in compliance with all financial covenants under our 2021 Credit Agreement, 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes at September 30, 2024.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 AND CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Table of Contents 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents and the fair value of our investments. 
 Our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market mutual funds, which are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk. Our investments are subject to interest rate risk because these securities generally include a fixed interest rate. As a result, the market values of these securities are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk by investing in instruments that meet the minimum credit quality, liquidity, diversification and other requirements of our investment policy. Our investments consist of liquid, investment-grade securities. The risk of rate changes on investment balances was not material at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had drawn down 175 million under our floating rate 2021 Revolver. The impact of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates to interest expense on our 2021 Revolver as of September 30, 2024 over the next twelve months was approximately 1.8 million.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 AND CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have, with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. 
 We have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 Incurred claims related to prior years represent changes in estimates for ultimate losses on workers' compensation claims. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, incurred losses from prior years increased primarily due to a relatively higher than expected reported claim frequency and severity for 2023 claims in comparison to 2024 claims. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, favorable development is due to lower than expected reported claim frequency and severity for years prior to 2023.

 Risk Factors 
 Other than the risk factor below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We face risks associated with our international operations 
 In August 2024, we opened a new office in Hyderabad, India, which increases the size and scale of our India-based workforce and operations. Historically, our business and operations have been primarily conducted in the United States. A disruption to, or our failure to successfully integrate, our operations in India involves risks. The risks associated with this and potential future international operations include: 
 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and global market volatility; 
 difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations, including cultural and language differences and additional employment regulations, union workforce negotiations and potential disputes; 
 geopolitical, economic or social instability or military conflict; 
 natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other events over which we have no control; 
 compliance with local laws and regulations, including privacy and security laws and regulations; 
 compliance with laws governing doing business outside the United States, including foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import controls, trade restrictions, tariffs, duties, taxes, embargoes, exchange or other government controls; 
 laws and business practices favoring local companies; and 
 management of potentially adverse tax consequences from India, the United States, or both, as a result of our multi-jurisdiction operations. 
 
 Any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully manage our business and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 As consideration for, among other things, my employment or continued employment after the date of this Agreement, all compensation now or hereafter paid to me, including but not limited to salary, commissions, bonus awards, insurance and other benefits, and all other forms and types of compensation and benefits, I agree to the terms and conditions of this Restrictive Covenants and Invention Disclosure Agreement RCAIDA or Agreement as follows 
 
 1. Maintaining Confidential Company Information. 
 A. I acknowledge and agree that during my employment with TriNet USA, Inc. or any of its successors, subsidiaries, assigns, and related companies, including TriNet Group, Inc. (collectively, the Company ), I will have access to, receive and or will review the Company s confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets (collectively, Confidential Information ). 
 
 Confidential Information shall include, but not be limited to, the following types of non-public information in any form 
 
 Trade secrets research and development plans or projects marketing, sales, financial, product and customer data and reports computer materials such as software programs, instructions, source and object code, and printouts information regarding the Company s products, prospective products, inventions, developments, and discoveries data compilations development databases business improvements business plans (whether pursued or not) budgets unpublished financial statements licenses, including the terms thereof fee agreements and vendor contracts pricing models, formulas, and strategy cost data and analyses information relating to the skills and compensation of other employees of the Company the personal information and protected health information of other employees of the Company which I would not have obtained absent my employment with the Company, including worksite employees brought to TriNet by its customers lists of former, current and potential customers of TriNet and all non-public information about them such as contact person(s), pricing, product and or service needs or requirements, profitability, cost to service, and other terms marketing strategies, forecasts and other marketing information and techniques employment and recruiting strategies and processes sales practices, strategies, methods, forecasts, compensation plans, and other sales information investor information and the identities of the Company s suppliers, vendors, and contractors, and all information about the Company s relationships with its suppliers, vendors and contractors such as contact person(s), pricing and other terms. 
 
 For clarity, Confidential Information is limited to information that is known only to the Company and its customers, vendors and or suppliers and that is not otherwise readily ascertainable to the public. To the extent that I have any question as to whether any information constitutes Confidential Information, or whether any email, spreadsheet, PowerPoint, file, or other document contains Confidential Information, I agree to obtain the express written permission of my manager before transmitting, using or disclosing the information for any purpose that is, in whole or in part, outside of my assigned job duties or responsibilities. In no event shall I transmit, use, or disclose Confidential Information for any purpose other than a purpose that is designed to be in the best interest of the Company. 
 
 Expressly excluded from the definition of Confidential Information is any information that (a) through no fault of mine is or becomes readily ascertainable to the public and or is readily and lawfully available to the public through a public media source such as television, radio or a publicly-available magazine or newspaper (b) I lawfully obtained and possessed prior to my employment with the Company (c) I lawfully obtained after termination of my employment with the Company from a third party who was lawfully in possession of the information and permitted

to disclose it to me (d) arises from my general training, knowledge, skill, or experience, whether gained on the job or otherwise or (e) I otherwise have a right to disclose as legally protected conduct. 
 1 

I understand and acknowledge that this definition and description of Confidential Information includes information in any and all forms, whether original, duplicated, compiled, aggregated, segregated, or summarized and whether on paper, electronically stored, conveyed verbally, residing in my memory, or reproduced from my memory. I agree that if information qualifies as Confidential Information, it does not lose its confidentiality simply because I am able to remember it. 
 
 B. During my employment with the Company, I shall not directly or indirectly transmit, disclose, furnish, or use any Confidential Information other than as reasonably needed to perform my job duties and responsibilities for the Company. I acknowledge and agree that I am only permitted to transmit, disclose, furnish, and use Confidential Information if, in so doing, I am acting in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. Once my employment with the Company ends, I shall not directly or indirectly transmit, use, furnish, or disclose any Confidential Information to any person or entity for any reason. 
 C. I acknowledge and agree that all Confidential Information is proprietary and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company.

This covenant to return Confidential Information includes all Confidential Information in my possession, custody, or control regardless of where it may reside or be stored. I acknowledge and agree that after my employment with the Company terminates, I shall not be permitted to retain in my possession, custody or control any documents or materials containing Confidential Information, whether such documents or materials are originals, copies, compilations, summaries, analyses, or otherwise. 
 
 D. My obligations under this Paragraph 1 are in addition to, and not in limitation or preemption of, all other obligations of confidentiality I may have, including any obligations under the common law, statutory law or under general legal or equitable principles, or under any other Agreement I may have with the Company.

I further agree that the terms of this Paragraph 1 are reasonably narrow to protect the Company s interests and will not impair, hinder, hamper, or otherwise impact my ability to obtain other gainful employment after my employment with the Company terminates. 
 
 F. In the event I receive a subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order to testify regarding or to disclose Confidential Information, I shall within five (5) business days of receiving such subpoena, deposition notice, or request (i) notify the Company s Legal Department in writing of the item, document, or information sought by such subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order (ii) furnish the Company s Legal Department with a copy of said subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order and (iii) provide reasonable cooperation with respect to any procedure that the Company may initiate to protect Confidential Information or other interests.

 2 

deposition, notice, interview request, or other process or order provided that I have fulfilled the above obligations.

I agree that while employed by the Company I owe the Company a duty of loyalty and a duty to act in good faith, whether such duty is assumed or implied in law. Thus, during my employment with the Company, I will not directly or indirectly, individually or in combination with any other employee, individual or competitor of the Company, compete against the Company. 
 B. During any period in which I am employed by the Company and for a period of one year thereafter, I shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action or engage in any conduct intended or reasonably calculated to solicit, approach, recruit, induce or urge any employee, independent contractor, or agent of the Company to discontinue, in whole or in part, his her employment relationship with the Company. The restrictions in this paragraph apply only to those employees, independent contractors, or agents of the Company who at any time during the twelve months preceding termination of my employment with the Company (a) I worked with in my department, (b) I had material contact with, or (c) I supervised. 
 
 C. During the period of my employment with the Company, and for a period of one year after my termination for any reason, I shall not directly or indirectly, for myself or on behalf of any other person or entity, solicit any entity that, at the time, has a contractual relationship with the Company for the purpose of (i) providing or selling services, goods or products that are the same as or similar to the kinds or types of services, goods or products being provided or sold by the Company, or (ii) entering into or seeking to enter into any contract or other arrangement with any such entity for the performance or sale of services or goods and products of a nature being provided or sold by the Company. I understand that my agreement not to solicit as set forth in this paragraph means that I will not, directly or indirectly, initiate any contact or communication with any entity that, at the time, has a contractual relationship with the Company for the purpose of soliciting, inviting, encouraging, recommending or requesting any such entity to do business with me and or any other person or entity. This Paragraph 5(C) shall be limited to (i) entities which I directly solicited, assisted, or otherwise provided services to or for at any time during the last twelve months of my employment with the Company and or (ii) entities for which I received commissions or retention compensation from the Company at any time during the last twelve months of my employment with the Company. 
 D. I acknowledge and agree that, due to nature of the Company s business, the restrictive covenants contained in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 are essential for the reasonable, proper and adequate protection of the Company s business, goodwill, trade secrets, proprietary data and confidential information. I further acknowledge and agree that the covenants in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 are narrowly tailored, are not overly broad or unduly burdensome, and will not prevent me from earning a livelihood following the termination of my employment with the Company.

6. Ownership of Discoveries & Results and Proceeds. Any inventions (whether or not patentable), discoveries, designs, business methods, improvements or works of authorship made by me, alone or jointly with others, and all results and proceeds of my services to the Company Results and Proceeds at any time during my employment by the Company which are made, conceived, reduced to practice or learned by me in the course and scope of my employment or with the use of the Company s time, property (whether tangible or intangible), materials or facilities, or relating to any subject matter with which my work for the Company is concerned, are hereby irrevocably and unconditionally assigned to the Company for its benefit and shall be the exclusive property of the Company. Any copyrightable subject matter included in the Results and Proceeds shall be works made for hire as that phrase is defined in the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. 101 et seq.). If it is ever determined that any Results and Proceeds cannot be considered works made for hire or otherwise cannot be fully assigned to the Company under applicable law, I hereby grant to the Company in perpetuity and on an exclusive and irrevocable basis all worldwide rights of every kind and nature, whether now known or hereafter recognized, in and to such Results and Proceeds to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Company has the exclusive right to obtain and own all patents and copyright registrations with respect to such Results and Proceeds. Neither the expiration nor the termination of this Agreement shall affect the Company s ownership of or rights in the Results and Proceeds or any intellectual property rights therein. To facilitate the determination of whether any invention, discovery, designs, business methods, improvement or work of authorship is properly transferable to the Company, I will promptly advise it of all inventions, discoveries, improvements or works of authorship made, conceived, reduced to practice or learned by me during the term of my employment and for six months after termination of my employment. I understand that my obligations under this Paragraph 6 do not apply to any invention that qualifies fully as a non-assignable invention under any law of any jurisdiction, in each case, to the extent applicable to my inventions. I have completed Exhibit A , which lists all inventions, improvements and other works Pre-existing Work that I have alone or jointly with others, conceived, developed, reduced to practice prior to the commencement of my employment with the Company, that I consider to be my property or the property of third parties. 
 I hereby represent and warrant that there is no Pre-existing Work other than as set forth in the attached Exhibit A. If Exhibit A is not completed in full, and included herein, there is no Pre-existing Work for which I claim ownership. I agree that I will not incorporate any Pre-existing Work into any Company works without first obtaining the express, written approval of the Company in each case. To the extent that I incorporate any Pre-existing Work into any Company works, I hereby represent and warrant that I have all necessary rights and authority to do so and hereby grant to Company the perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free and sublicensable right to use and exploit such Pre-existing Work for any and all purposes in connection with the Company's and its affiliates' and their respective successors' and assigns' current and future businesses. 
 
 7. Perfection and Enforcement of Proprietary Rights. I will assist the Company in every proper way at the Company's request and direction to obtain, perfect and enforce United States, Canadian and foreign patent, copyright, mask work and other intellectual property rights Proprietary Rights relating to Company information and or Results and Proceeds in any and all countries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, I will execute, verify and deliver such documents and perform such other acts (including appearances as a witness) as the Company may reasonably request for use in applying for, obtaining, perfecting, evidencing, sustaining and enforcing such Proprietary Rights and the assignment thereof. My obligation to assist the Company pursuant to this Paragraph 7 shall continue following the termination of my employment, but the Company shall compensate me at a reasonable rate to be determined by the Company consistent with its ordinary practices after my termination for the time actually spent by me at the Company s request for such assistance. If the Company or its designee is unable because of my mental or physical incapacity or unavailability or for any other reason to obtain my signature for any document required by this Paragraph 7, then I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney in fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute 
 7 

and file any such documents with the same legal force and effect as if originally executed by me, and I declare that this power of attorney shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and irrevocable, and may be exercised during any subsequent legal incapacity. 
 
 8 

8. No Continued Employment Exit Interview. I understand that my employment with the Company is at-will and that this Agreement does not confer any right of continued employment by the Company and does not limit in any way the Company s right or my right to terminate my employment at any time and for any reason or no reason, with or without cause in accordance with applicable law. In the event my employment with the Company terminates for any reason, I will, if requested, participate in an exit interview with the Company and reaffirm in writing my obligations as set forth in this Agreement (though such re-affirmance is not required in order for the terms of this Agreement to remain valid and enforceable). I agree to provide the Company with the name and address of my new employer, and consent to the Company s notification to my new employer of my rights and obligations under this Agreement, including that I agree the Company may provide a copy of this Agreement to any such new employer. 
 9. Legal and Equitable Remedies. 
 A. In the event I breach or threaten to breach, or the Company reasonably believes I am about to breach, any of the terms, conditions or restrictive covenants in Paragraphs 1, 2 or 5 of this Agreement, I agree that the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief as well as an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and other benefits relating to or arising from a violation of this Agreement, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the Company may be entitled at law or in equity. I acknowledge and agree that a breach of Paragraphs 1, 2 or 5 will cause the Company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm and that money damages will not be adequate to compensate the Company or to preserve the status quo. Therefore, I consent to the issuance of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and other injunctive relief necessary to enforce this Agreement. 
 
 B. In the event of a breach of Paragraph 5, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction, judgment, or other order that requires me to comply with the breached term, condition or covenant for a time period equal to the period of the breach. The relief provided for in this Paragraph 9(B) shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other rights and remedies available at law and equity. 
 C. I agree that any application for temporary restraining order and or temporary or preliminary injunctive relief shall be adjudicated exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction, even if the Company and I are parties to an arbitration agreement that otherwise includes disputes under this Agreement. I agree that the injunctive relief to which I consented above, under the circumstances addressed in this Section 9(C), shall be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction pending arbitration on the merits to preserve the status quo pending completion of such arbitration. 
 D. I agree that in any proceeding alleging breach of this Agreement (whether in court or in arbitration), the Company and I each shall have the right to engage in deposition and document discovery, and the Company shall have the right to conduct forensic examination(s) of any computers and or electronic devices in my possession, custody or control, if the Company reasonably believes such devices contain Confidential Information or other Company property. I further agree that in connection with any application for injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement (including without limitation any application for temporary and or preliminary injunctive relief), the foregoing discovery shall be conducted on an expedited basis, including expedited document and deposition discovery. 
 
 E. If any dispute under this Agreement is subject to resolution by arbitration under an agreement or program agreed to by me with the Company, I understand and agree that my agreement to engage in expedited discovery as outlined in Section 9(D) is an essential term of the parties arbitration agreement, and these provisions are intended to supplement and modify any applicable arbitration rules which may be incorporated into any arbitration 
 9 

agreement that is applicable to the dispute. Accordingly, both I and the Company request that any court of competent jurisdiction order such expedited discovery in order to enforce the parties arbitration agreement as written and in accordance with its terms. 
 10 

F. I understand and agree that all of the foregoing remedies are expressly without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement (including recovery of monetary damages, which may include clawback or disgorgement of any compensation paid during any period of disloyalty or breach of this Agreement). 
 G. If a lawsuit is brought that relates to or arises out of this Agreement or my employment with or termination from the Company, the prevailing party in that lawsuit shall be awarded its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. 
 
 10. Modification & Severability Other Restrictive Covenants. If any section, provision, paragraph, phrase, word, and or line (collectively Provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, then I agree that this Agreement will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to render the otherwise unenforceable Provision, and the rest of the Agreement, valid and enforceable. If a court declines to amend this Agreement as provided herein, the invalidity or unenforceability of any Provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining Provisions, which shall be enforced as if the offending Provision had not been included in this Agreement. 
 I further agree that if one or more post-employment restrictive covenants in this Agreement are found unenforceable (despite, and after application of, any applicable right to reformation that could add or renew enforceability), then, and only then, any provision(s) of any prior agreement between the parties that would provide for restriction(s) on the same or substantially similar post-employment conduct shall not be considered superseded and shall remain in effect so as to afford the Company the broadest protections allowed under applicable law. 
 
 11. Binding Effect and Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors, assigns, affiliated entities, and any party-in-interest. I agree that, should the Company be acquired by, merge with, or otherwise combine with another corporation or business entity, the surviving entity will have all rights to enforce the terms of this Agreement as if it were the Company itself enforcing the Agreement. I understand and agree that this Agreement applies no matter which company or affiliate within the Company I may be employed with at any given time. I expressly agree that this Agreement may be enforced against me by any Company affiliate, without the need for any formal assignment of this Agreement, but in the event such an assignment is made, I hereby consent to such assignment without any further assent from me required to make such assignment binding and effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I understand and agree that I may not assign this Agreement. 
 
 12. Survival. The provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of my employment, regardless of the reason for the termination, and shall also survive the assignment of this Agreement by the Company to any successor in interest or other assignee. 
 
 13. Waiver & Amendment. I agree and understand that a waiver by the Company of the breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach, nor shall recourse to any remedy hereunder be deemed a waiver of any other or further relief or remedy provided for herein. No waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an officer of the Company. The Company shall not be required to give notice to enforce strict adherence to all terms of this Agreement. This Agreement can only be amended or changed in a writing signed by both parties. 
 
 14. Change in Employment. I agree that any subsequent change in my duties or title will not affect in any respect the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Agreement. 
 
 11 

15. Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. I understand and agree that in the event of any disputes under this Agreement, then the following applies 
 
 12 

A. The Agreement will be governed by, construed, interpreted, and its validity determined under the laws of the State of Colorado. 
 B. The parties hereby consent to jurisdiction in such court for such purpose, and I consent to service of process by mail in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding. The parties further agree not to file any action relating in any way to this Agreement in any court other than as specified in this Section. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if any dispute under this Agreement is subject to resolution by arbitration under an agreement or program agreed to by me and the Company, then such arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive venue for adjudicating such disputes, other than any requests for a temporary restraining order and or a temporary or preliminary injunction pending arbitration, which are reserved exclusively for adjudication in court pursuant to Section 9 above even in otherwise arbitrable disputes. 
 
 I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL OF ITS TERMS.

 As consideration for, among other things, my employment or continued employment after the date of this Agreement, all compensation now or hereafter paid to me, including but not limited to salary, commissions, bonus awards, insurance and other benefits, and all other forms and types of compensation and benefits, I agree to the terms and conditions of this Restrictive Covenants and Invention Disclosure Agreement RCAIDA or Agreement as follows 
 
 1. Maintaining Confidential Company Information. 
 A. I acknowledge and agree that during my employment with TriNet USA, Inc. or any of its successors, subsidiaries, assigns, and related companies, including TriNet Group, Inc. (collectively, the Company ), I will have access to, receive and or will review the Company s confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets (collectively, Confidential Information ). 
 
 Confidential Information shall include, but not be limited to, the following types of non-public information in any form 
 
 Trade secrets research and development plans or projects marketing, sales, financial, product and customer data and reports computer materials such as software programs, instructions, source and object code, and printouts information regarding the Company s products, prospective products, inventions, developments, and discoveries data compilations development databases business improvements business plans (whether pursued or not) budgets unpublished financial statements licenses, including the terms thereof fee agreements and vendor contracts pricing models, formulas, and strategy cost data and analyses information relating to the skills and compensation of other employees of the Company the personal information and protected health information of other employees of the Company which I would not have obtained absent my employment with the Company, including worksite employees brought to TriNet by its customers lists of former, current and potential customers of TriNet and all non-public information about them such as contact person(s), pricing, product and or service needs or requirements, profitability, cost to service, and other terms marketing strategies, forecasts and other marketing information and techniques employment and recruiting strategies and processes sales practices, strategies, methods, forecasts, compensation plans, and other sales information investor information and the identities of the Company s suppliers, vendors, and contractors, and all information about the Company s relationships with its suppliers, vendors and contractors such as contact person(s), pricing and other terms. 
 
 For clarity, Confidential Information is limited to information that is known only to the Company and its customers, vendors and or suppliers and that is not otherwise readily ascertainable to the public. To the extent that I have any question as to whether any information constitutes Confidential Information, or whether any email, spreadsheet, PowerPoint, file, or other document contains Confidential Information, I agree to obtain the express written permission of my manager before transmitting, using or disclosing the information for any purpose that is, in whole or in part, outside of my assigned job duties or responsibilities. In no event shall I transmit, use, or disclose Confidential Information for any purpose other than a purpose that is designed to be in the best interest of the Company. 
 
 Expressly excluded from the definition of Confidential Information is any information that (a) through no fault of mine is or becomes readily ascertainable to the public and or is readily and lawfully available to the public through a public media source such as television, radio or a publicly-available magazine or newspaper (b) I lawfully obtained and possessed prior to my employment with the Company (c) I lawfully obtained after termination of my employment with the Company from a third party who was lawfully in possession of the information and permitted 
 1 

to disclose it to me (d) arises from my general training, knowledge, skill, or experience, whether gained on the job or otherwise or (e) I otherwise have a right to disclose as legally protected conduct. 
 1 

I understand and acknowledge that this definition and description of Confidential Information includes information in any and all forms, whether original, duplicated, compiled, aggregated, segregated, or summarized and whether on paper, electronically stored, conveyed verbally, residing in my memory, or reproduced from my memory. I agree that if information qualifies as Confidential Information, it does not lose its confidentiality simply because I am able to remember it. 
 
 B. During my employment with the Company, I shall not directly or indirectly transmit, disclose, furnish, or use any Confidential Information other than as reasonably needed to perform my job duties and responsibilities for the Company. I acknowledge and agree that I am only permitted to transmit, disclose, furnish, and use Confidential Information if, in so doing, I am acting in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. Once my employment with the Company ends, I shall not directly or indirectly transmit, use, furnish, or disclose any Confidential Information to any person or entity for any reason. 
 C. I acknowledge and agree that all Confidential Information is proprietary and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company. Accordingly, within ten calendar days of the earlier of (1) my providing notice of resignation to the Company (2) the Company s notice to me of the separation of my employment or (3) the end of my employment with the Company for any other reason or under any other circumstance, I shall return to the Company any and all Confidential Information in my possession, custody or control, including, but not limited to, all Confidential Information contained in any email, word processing document, PowerPoint presentation, spreadsheet, text, instant message or other electronically-stored document or electronic data storage media, without exception. This covenant to return Confidential Information includes all Confidential Information in my possession, custody, or control regardless of where it may reside or be stored. I acknowledge and agree that after my employment with the Company terminates, I shall not be permitted to retain in my possession, custody or control any documents or materials containing Confidential Information, whether such documents or materials are originals, copies, compilations, summaries, analyses, or otherwise. 
 
 D. My obligations under this Paragraph 1 are in addition to, and not in limitation or preemption of, all other obligations of confidentiality I may have, including any obligations under the common law, statutory law or under general legal or equitable principles, or under any other Agreement I may have with the Company. 
 
 E. I agree that the terms of this Paragraph 1 are reasonable and essential for the protection of the goodwill, trade secrets, proprietary data and confidential information of the Company that the Company s Confidential Information provides the Company with a competitive advantage in the marketplace that activity in violation of this Paragraph 1 is likely to cause substantial and irreparable harm to the Company and that the Company has legitimate business reasons to seek protection against improper and unauthorized disclosures of Confidential Information. I further agree that the terms of this Paragraph 1 are reasonably narrow to protect the Company s interests and will not impair, hinder, hamper, or otherwise impact my ability to obtain other gainful employment after my employment with the Company terminates. 
 
 F. In the event I receive a subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order to testify regarding or to disclose Confidential Information, I shall within five (5) business days of receiving such subpoena, deposition notice, or request (i) notify the Company s Legal Department in writing of the item, document, or information sought by such subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order (ii) furnish the Company s Legal Department with a copy of said subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, or other process or order and (iii) provide reasonable cooperation with respect to any procedure that the Company may initiate to protect Confidential Information or other interests. If the Company objects to the subpoena, deposition notice, interview request, process, or order, I shall cooperate to ensure that there shall be no disclosure until the court or other applicable entity has ruled upon the objection, and then only in accordance with the ruling so made. If no such objection is made despite a reasonable opportunity to do so, I shall be entitled to comply with the subpoena, 
 2 

deposition, notice, interview request, or other process or order provided that I have fulfilled the above obligations. 
 
 G. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act, I understand that an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (a) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (b) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. Further, I understand that an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the employer s trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (a) files any document containing the trade secret under seal and (b) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. 
 
 H. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or otherwise, I understand that 
 
 (1) I have the right under federal law to certain protections for cooperating with or reporting legal violations to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and or its Office of the Whistleblower, as well as certain other governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations, and as such, nothing in this Agreement or otherwise is intended to prohibit me from disclosing this Agreement to, or from cooperating with or reporting violations to, the SEC or any other such governmental authority or self-regulatory organization, and I may do so without notifying the Company. The Company may not retaliate against me for any of these activities, and nothing in this Agreement or otherwise would require me to inform the Company of any of these activities or waive any monetary award or other payment that I might become entitled to from the SEC or any other governmental authority. 
 
 (2) Nothing in this Paragraph 1 or this Agreement shall limit in any way any statutory right I may have to disclose or use information under Section 7 of the United States National Labor Relations Act or any other applicable law. I further understand and acknowledge that nothing in this Paragraph 1 or this Agreement prohibits me from disclosing information about my wages or terms and conditions of employment or from disclosing unlawful acts in the workplace such as sexual harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. I understand and acknowledge that the Company will not take any disciplinary action or other adverse employment action against me for properly exercising my legal rights. 
 
 (3) Nothing in this Paragraph 1 or this Agreement shall preclude me from maintaining, possessing, or disclosing at any time my own personal information, including without limitation my pay history, wage statements, and tax-related documents and materials, even after my employment with the Company terminates. 
 
 (4) If I am unsure or uncertain as to whether information constitutes a trade secret, I will contact the Company s Legal Department to discuss the issue and I agree that I will not transmit, disclose, or use the information in question without first obtaining express written consent from the Company s authorized legal representative. 
 2. Third-Party Information. 
 A. I acknowledge and agree that the Company has in the past received, and in the future will receive, information from customers, vendors and other third parties that is confidential, proprietary, or that the third party does not want disclosed outside of the Company Third-Party Information ). I understand that the Company typically receives such information under a legal duty to maintain its confidence, and that the Company has a legitimate business interest

in ensuring that it does not disclose Third-Party Information to persons outside of the Company, to persons within the Company who are not authorized to access or use it, or to any party who seeks to use or disclose it for an improper or unauthorized purpose. 
 B. During my employment with the Company, I shall not directly or indirectly transmit, disclose, furnish, or use any Third-Party Information other than as I am expressly authorized and as reasonably needed to perform my job duties and responsibilities for the Company. I acknowledge and agree that I am only permitted to transmit, disclose, furnish, and use Third-Party Information if, in so doing, I am authorized to do so, act in good faith, and do so in the best interests of the Company. Once my employment with the Company ends, I shall not directly or indirectly transmit, use, furnish, or disclose any Third-Party Information to any person or entity for any reason. 
 
 C. Within ten calendar days of the earlier of (1) my providing notice of resignation to the Company (2) the Company s notice to me of the separation of my employment or (3) the end of my employment with the Company for any other reason or under any other circumstance, I shall return to the Company any and all Third-Party Information in my possession, custody or control, including, but not limited to, all Third-Party Information contained in any email, word processing document, PowerPoint presentation, spreadsheet, text, instant message, any hard copy or other electronically-stored document, without exception. This covenant to return Confidential Information includes all Confidential Information in my possession, custody, or control regardless of where it may reside or be stored. I further acknowledge and agree that I shall not be permitted to retain in my possession, custody or control any documents or materials containing Third-Party Information, whether such documents or materials are original, copies, compilations, summaries, analyses, or otherwise. 
 
 D. My obligations under this Paragraph 2 are in addition to, and not in limitation or preemption of, all other obligations of confidentiality I may have, including any obligations under the common law, statutory law or under general legal or equitable principles, or under any other Agreement I may have with the Company. 
 E. I agree that the terms of this Paragraph 2 are reasonable and essential for the protection of Third-Party Information that activity in violation of this Paragraph 2 may cause substantial and irreparable harm to the Company and or its customers, vendors and other third parties and that the Company has legitimate business reasons to seek protection against improper disclosures of Third-Party Information entrusted to the Company. I further agree that the terms of this Paragraph 2 are reasonably narrow to protect the Company s interests and will not impair, hinder, hamper, or otherwise impact my ability to obtain other gainful employment after my employment with the Company terminates. 
 
 2. No Improper Use of Information of Prior Employers and Others. During my employment with the Company, I will not improperly use or disclose any confidential information or trade secrets of any former employer or any other person to whom I have an obligation of confidentiality, and I will not bring on to Company premises or place on any Company hardware, software, or equipment any proprietary or confidential information or property belonging to any former employer or any other person to whom I have an obligation of confidentiality (unless consented to in writing by that former employer or person). I will use in the performance of my duties only information which is generally known and used by persons with training and experience comparable to my own, which is common knowledge in the industry or otherwise legally in the public domain, or which is otherwise provided or developed by the Company. I represent and warrant that my employment with the Company will not violate or breach any agreement I have entered with any other person or entity. I further represent and warrant that I have disclosed to the Company, in writing, any restrictive covenants I may be bound to, including any non-disclosure, non-solicitation, and non-competition covenants. 
 3. Return of Company Property. In addition to the obligations in Paragraphs 1 and 2 above, when I leave the employ of the Company, I will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in my possession, copy, recreate or deliver to 
 4 

anyone else in whole or in part) any and all items I received from the Company including but not limited to files, drawings, 
 5

 4. No Conflicting Employment Solicitation Restrictions. 
 A. While employed by the Company, I will not, without the Company s prior written consent, directly or indirectly engage in any employment, consulting, contracting, soliciting, sales, marketing or other activity wherein I may use or disclose the Company s Confidential Information or conflict with any of my obligations under this Agreement. I agree that while employed by the Company I owe the Company a duty of loyalty and a duty to act in good faith, whether such duty is assumed or implied in law. Thus, during my employment with the Company, I will not directly or indirectly, individually or in combination with any other employee, individual or competitor of the Company, compete against the Company. 
 B. During any period in which I am employed by the Company and for a period of one year thereafter, I shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action or engage in any conduct intended or reasonably calculated to solicit, approach, recruit, induce or urge any employee, independent contractor, or agent of the Company to discontinue, in whole or in part, his her employment relationship with the Company.

During the period of my employment with the Company, and for a period of one year after my termination for any reason, I shall not directly or indirectly, for myself or on behalf of any other person or entity, solicit any entity that, at the time, has a contractual relationship with the Company for the purpose of (i) providing or selling services, goods or products that are the same as or similar to the kinds or types of services, goods or products being provided or sold by the Company, or (ii) entering into or seeking to enter into any contract or other arrangement with any such entity for the performance or sale of services or goods and products of a nature being provided or sold by the Company. I understand that my agreement not to solicit as set forth in this paragraph means that I will not, directly or indirectly, initiate any contact or communication with any entity that, at the time, has a contractual relationship with the Company for the purpose of soliciting, inviting, encouraging, recommending or requesting any such entity to do business with me and or any other person or entity. This Paragraph 5(C) shall be limited to (i) entities which I directly solicited, assisted, or otherwise provided services to or for at any time during the last twelve months of my employment with the Company and or (ii) entities for which I received commissions or retention compensation from the Company at any time during the last twelve months of my employment with the Company. 
 D. I acknowledge and agree that, due to nature of the Company s business, the restrictive covenants contained in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 are essential for the reasonable, proper and adequate protection of the Company s business, goodwill, trade secrets, proprietary data and confidential information.

5. Ownership of Discoveries & Results and Proceeds. Any inventions (whether or not patentable), discoveries, designs, business methods, improvements or works of authorship made by me, alone or jointly with others, and all results and proceeds of my services to the Company Results and Proceeds at any time during my employment by the Company which are made, conceived, reduced to practice or learned by me in the course and scope of my employment or with the use of the Company s time, property (whether tangible or intangible), materials or facilities, or relating to any subject matter with which my work for the Company is concerned, are hereby irrevocably and unconditionally assigned to the Company for its benefit and shall be the exclusive property of the Company. Any copyrightable subject matter included in the Results and Proceeds shall be works made for hire as that phrase is defined in the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. 101 et seq.). If it is ever determined that any Results and Proceeds cannot be considered works made for hire or otherwise cannot be fully assigned to the Company under applicable law, I hereby grant to the Company in perpetuity and on an exclusive and irrevocable basis all worldwide rights of every kind and nature, whether now known or hereafter recognized, in and to such Results and Proceeds to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Company has the exclusive right to obtain and own all patents and copyright registrations with respect to such Results and Proceeds. Neither the expiration nor the termination of this Agreement shall affect the Company s ownership of or rights in the Results and Proceeds or any intellectual property rights therein. To facilitate the determination of whether any invention, discovery, designs, business methods, improvement or work of authorship is properly transferable to the Company, I will promptly advise it of all inventions, discoveries, improvements or works of authorship made, conceived, reduced to practice or learned by me during the term of my employment and for six months after termination of my employment. I understand that my obligations under this Paragraph 6 do not apply to any invention that qualifies fully as a non-assignable invention under any law of any jurisdiction, in each case, to the extent applicable to my inventions. I have completed Exhibit A , which lists all inventions, improvements and other works Pre-existing Work that I have alone or jointly with others, conceived, developed, reduced to practice prior to the commencement of my employment with the Company, that I consider to be my property or the property of third parties. 
 I hereby represent and warrant that there is no Pre-existing Work other than as set forth in the attached Exhibit A. If Exhibit A is not completed in full, and included herein, there is no Pre-existing Work for which I claim ownership. I agree that I will not incorporate any Pre-existing Work into any Company works without first obtaining the express, written approval of the Company in each case. To the extent that I incorporate any Pre-existing Work into any Company works, I hereby represent and warrant that I have all necessary rights and authority to do so and hereby grant to Company the perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free and sublicensable right to use and exploit such Pre-existing Work for any and all purposes in connection with the Company's and its affiliates' and their respective successors' and assigns' current and future businesses. 
 
 6. Perfection and Enforcement of Proprietary Rights. I will assist the Company in every proper way at the Company's request and direction to obtain, perfect and enforce United States, Canadian and foreign patent, copyright, mask work and other intellectual property rights Proprietary Rights relating to Company information and or Results and Proceeds in any and all countries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, I will execute, verify and deliver such documents and perform such other acts (including appearances as a witness) as the Company may reasonably request for use in applying for, obtaining, perfecting, evidencing, sustaining and enforcing such Proprietary Rights and the assignment thereof. My obligation to assist the Company pursuant to this Paragraph 7 shall continue following the termination of my employment, but the Company shall compensate me at a reasonable rate to be determined by the Company consistent with its ordinary practices after my termination for the time actually spent by me at the Company s request for such assistance. If the Company or its designee is unable because of my mental or physical incapacity or unavailability or for any other reason to obtain my signature for any document required by this Paragraph 7, then I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney in fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute 
 7 

and file any such documents with the same legal force and effect as if originally executed by me, and I declare that this power of attorney shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and irrevocable, and may be exercised during any subsequent legal incapacity. 
 
 8 

7. No Continued Employment Exit Interview. I understand that my employment with the Company is at-will and that this Agreement does not confer any right of continued employment by the Company and does not limit in any way the Company s right or my right to terminate my employment at any time and for any reason or no reason, with or without cause in accordance with applicable law. In the event my employment with the Company terminates for any reason, I will, if requested, participate in an exit interview with the Company and reaffirm in writing my obligations as set forth in this Agreement (though such re-affirmance is not required in order for the terms of this Agreement to remain valid and enforceable). I agree to provide the Company with the name and address of my new employer, and consent to the Company s notification to my new employer of my rights and obligations under this Agreement, including that I agree the Company may provide a copy of this Agreement to any such new employer. 
 8. Legal and Equitable Remedies. 
 A. In the event I breach or threaten to breach, or the Company reasonably believes I am about to breach, any of the terms, conditions or restrictive covenants in Paragraphs 1, 2 or 5 of this Agreement, I agree that the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief as well as an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and other benefits relating to or arising from a violation of this Agreement, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the Company may be entitled at law or in equity. I acknowledge and agree that a breach of Paragraphs 1, 2 or 5 will cause the Company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm and that money damages will not be adequate to compensate the Company or to preserve the status quo. Therefore, I consent to the issuance of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and other injunctive relief necessary to enforce this Agreement. 
 
 B. In the event of a breach of Paragraph 5, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction, judgment, or other order that requires me to comply with the breached term, condition or covenant for a time period equal to the period of the breach. The relief provided for in this Paragraph 9(B) shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other rights and remedies available at law and equity. 
 C. I agree that any application for temporary restraining order and or temporary or preliminary injunctive relief shall be adjudicated exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction, even if the Company and I are parties to an arbitration agreement that otherwise includes disputes under this Agreement. I agree that the injunctive relief to which I consented above, under the circumstances addressed in this Section 9(C), shall be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction pending arbitration on the merits to preserve the status quo pending completion of such arbitration. 
 D. I agree that in any proceeding alleging breach of this Agreement (whether in court or in arbitration), the Company and I each shall have the right to engage in deposition and document discovery, and the Company shall have the right to conduct forensic examination(s) of any computers and or electronic devices in my possession, custody or control, if the Company reasonably believes such devices contain Confidential Information or other Company property. I further agree that in connection with any application for injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement (including without limitation any application for temporary and or preliminary injunctive relief), the foregoing discovery shall be conducted on an expedited basis, including expedited document and deposition discovery. 
 
 E. If any dispute under this Agreement is subject to resolution by arbitration under an agreement or program agreed to by me with the Company, I understand and agree that my agreement to engage in expedited discovery as outlined in Section 9(D) is an essential term of the parties arbitration agreement, and these provisions are intended to supplement and modify any applicable arbitration rules which may be incorporated into any arbitration 
 9 

agreement that is applicable to the dispute. Accordingly, both I and the Company request that any court of competent jurisdiction order such expedited discovery in order to enforce the parties arbitration agreement as written and in accordance with its terms. 
 10 

F. I understand and agree that all of the foregoing remedies are expressly without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement (including recovery of monetary damages, which may include clawback or disgorgement of any compensation paid during any period of disloyalty or breach of this Agreement). 
 G. If a lawsuit is brought that relates to or arises out of this Agreement or my employment with or termination from the Company, the prevailing party in that lawsuit shall be awarded its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. 
 
 10. Modification & Severability Other Restrictive Covenants. If any section, provision, paragraph, phrase, word, and or line (collectively Provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, then I agree that this Agreement will be deemed amended to the extent necessary to render the otherwise unenforceable Provision, and the rest of the Agreement, valid and enforceable. If a court declines to amend this Agreement as provided herein, the invalidity or unenforceability of any Provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining Provisions, which shall be enforced as if the offending Provision had not been included in this Agreement. 
 I further agree that if one or more post-employment restrictive covenants in this Agreement are found unenforceable (despite, and after application of, any applicable right to reformation that could add or renew enforceability), then, and only then, any provision(s) of any prior agreement between the parties that would provide for restriction(s) on the same or substantially similar post-employment conduct shall not be considered superseded and shall remain in effect so as to afford the Company the broadest protections allowed under applicable law. 
 
 11. Binding Effect and Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors, assigns, affiliated entities, and any party-in-interest. I agree that, should the Company be acquired by, merge with, or otherwise combine with another corporation or business entity, the surviving entity will have all rights to enforce the terms of this Agreement as if it were the Company itself enforcing the Agreement. I understand and agree that this Agreement applies no matter which company or affiliate within the Company I may be employed with at any given time. I expressly agree that this Agreement may be enforced against me by any Company affiliate, without the need for any formal assignment of this Agreement, but in the event such an assignment is made, I hereby consent to such assignment without any further assent from me required to make such assignment binding and effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I understand and agree that I may not assign this Agreement. 
 
 12. Survival. The provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of my employment, regardless of the reason for the termination, and shall also survive the assignment of this Agreement by the Company to any successor in interest or other assignee. 
 
 13. Waiver & Amendment. I agree and understand that a waiver by the Company of the breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach, nor shall recourse to any remedy hereunder be deemed a waiver of any other or further relief or remedy provided for herein. No waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an officer of the Company. The Company shall not be required to give notice to enforce strict adherence to all terms of this Agreement. This Agreement can only be amended or changed in a writing signed by both parties. 
 
 14. Change in Employment. I agree that any subsequent change in my duties or title will not affect in any respect the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Agreement. 
 
 11 

15. Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. I understand and agree that in the event of any disputes under this Agreement, then the following applies 
 
 12 

A. The Agreement will be governed by, construed, interpreted, and its validity determined under the laws of the State of Colorado.

The parties further agree not to file any action relating in any way to this Agreement in any court other than as specified in this Section. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if any dispute under this Agreement is subject to resolution by arbitration under an agreement or program agreed to by me and the Company, then such arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive venue for adjudicating such disputes, other than any requests for a temporary restraining order and or a temporary or preliminary injunction pending arbitration, which are reserved exclusively for adjudication in court pursuant to Section 9 above even in otherwise arbitrable disputes.

 For clarity, Confidential Information is limited to information that is known only to the Company and its customers, vendors and or suppliers and that is not otherwise generally available t o the public. To the extent that I have any question as to whether any information constitutes Confidential Information , or whether any email, spreadsheet , PowerPoint, file , or other document contains Confident i al Information, I agree to obtain the express written permission of my manager before transmitting, using or disclosing the information for any purpose that is, in whole or in part, outside of my assigned job duties or responsibilities. In no event shall I transmit, use, or disclose Confidential Information for any purpose other than a purpose that is designed to be in the best interest of the Company.

Any inventions (whether or not patentable), discoveries, designs, business methods, improvements or works of authorship made by me, alone or jointly with others, and all results and proceeds of my services to the Company Results and Proceeds at any time during my employment by the Company which are made, conceived, reduced to practice or learned by me in the course and scope of my employment or with the use of the Company's time, property (whether tangible or intangible), materials or facilities, or relating to any subject matter with which my work for the Company is concerned, are hereby irrevocably and unconditionally assigned to the Company for its benefit and shall be the exclusive property of the Company.

Neither the expiration nor the termination of this Agreement shall affect the Company's ownership of or rights in the Results and Proceeds or any intellectual property rights therein. To facilitate the determination of whether any invention, discovery, designs, business methods, improvement or work of authorship is properly transferable to the Company, I will promptly advise it of all inventions, discoveries, improvements or works of authorship made, conceived, reduced to practice or learned by me during the term of my employment and for six months after termination of my employment. I understand that my obl i ga t ions under this Paragraph 6 do not apply to any invention that qualifies fully as a non-assignable invention under any law of any jurisdiction, in each case, to the extent applicable to my inventions. 
 
 I hereby represent and warrant that all Pre-existing Work for which I claim ownership was disclosed in writing by me to the Company in connection with my prior Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement (PIIA), which disclosures, if any, are incorporated herein by reference. P r e - e xist i ng Work consists of inventions, improvements and other works I alone or jointly conceived, developed, or reduced to practice prior to commencement of my employment with the Company, that I considered to be my property or the property of third parties when I executed any prior invention disclosure or PIIA with th e Company.) 

I agree that I will not incorporate any Pre-existing Work into any Company works without first obta i ning the express, written approval of the Company in each case. To the extent that I incorporate any Pre-existing Work into any Company works, I hereby represent and warrant that I have all necessary rights and authority to do so and hereby grant to Company the perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free and sublicensable right to use and exploit such Pre-existing Work for any and all purposes in connection with the Company's and its affiliates' and their respective successors' and assigns' current and future businesses. 
 
 7. Perfection and Enforcement of Proprietary Rights. I will assist the Company in every proper way at the Company's request and direction to obtain, perfect and enforce United States, Canadian and foreign patent, copyright, mask work and other intellectual property rights Proprietary Rights relating to Company information and or Results and Proceeds in any and all countries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, I will execute, verify and deliver such documents and perform such other acts (including appearances as a witness) as the Company may reasonably request for use in applying for, obtaining, perfecting, evidencing, sustaining and enforcing such Proprietary Rights and the assignment thereof. My obligation to assist the Company pursuant to this Paragraph 7 shall continue following the termination of my employment, but the Company shall compensate me at a reasonable rate to be determined by the Company consistent with its ordinary practices after my termination for the time actually spent by me at the Company's request for such assistance. If the Company or its designee is unable because of my mental or physical incapacity or unavailability or for any other reason to obtain my signature for any document required by this Paragraph 7, then I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney in fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such documents with the same legal force and effect as if originally executed by me , and I declare that this power of attorney shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and irrevocable, and may be exercised during any subsequent legal incapacity. 
 
 8. No Continued Employment Exit Interview. I understand that my employment with the Company is at-will and that this Agreement does not confer any right of continued employment by the Company and does not limit in any way the Company's right or my right to terminate my employment at any time and for any reason or no reason, with or without cause in accordance with applicable law. In the event my employment with the Company terminates for any reason, I will, if requested, participate in an exit interview with the Company and reaffirm in writing my obligations as set forth in this Agreement (though such re-affirmance is not required in order for the terms of this Agreement to remain valid and enforceable). I agree to provide the Company with the name and address of my new employer, and consent to the Company's notification to my new employer of my rights and obligations under this Agreement, including that I agree the Company may provide a copy of this Agreement to any such new employer. 
 
 9. Legal and Equitable Remedies. 
 
 A. In the event I breach or threaten to breach, or the Company reasonably believes I am about to breach, any of the terms, conditions or restrictive covenants in Paragraphs 1, 2 or 5 of this Ag r eement, I agree that the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief as well as an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and other benefits relating to or arising from a violation of this Agreement, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the Company may be entitled at law or in equity. I acknowledge and agree that a breach of Paragraphs 1, 2 or 5 will cause the Company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm and that money damages will not be adequate to compensate the Company or to 

preserve the status quo. Therefore, I consent to the issuance of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and other injunctive relief necessary to enforce this Agreement. 
 
 B. In the event of a breach of Paragraph 5, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction, judgment, or other order that requires me to comply with the breached term, condition or covenant for a time period equal to the period of the breach. The relief provided for in this Paragraph 9(8) shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other rights and remedies available at law and equity. 
 
 C. I agree that any application for temporary restraining order and or temporary or prelimina r y injunctive relief shall be adjudicated exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction, even if the Company and I a r e parties to an arbitration agreement that otherwise includes disputes under this Agreement.

 D. I agree that in any proceeding alleging breach of this Agreement (whether in court or in arbitration) , the Company and I each shall have the right to engage in deposition and document discovery, and the Company shall have the right to conduct forensic examination(s) of any computers and or electronic devices in my possession, custody or control, if the Company reasonably believes such devices contain Confidential Information or other Company property. I further agree that in connection with any application for injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement (including without limitation any application for temporary and or preliminary injunctive relief), the foregoing discovery shall be conducted on an expedited basis, including expedited document and deposition discovery. 
 
 E. If any dispute under this Agreement is subject to resolution by arbitration under an agreement or program agreed to by me with the Company, I understand and agree that my agreement to engage in expedited discovery as outlined in Section 9(D) is an essential term of the parties' arbitration agreement, and these provisions are intended to supplement and modify any applicable arbitration rules which may be incorporated into any arbitration agreement that is applicable to the dispute. Accordingly, both I and the Company request that any court of competent jurisdiction order such expedited discovery in order to enforce the parties' arbitration agreement as written and in accordance with its terms. 
 
 F. I understand and agree that all of the foregoing remedies are expressly without prejudice t o any other rights and remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement (including recovery of monetary damages, which may include clawback or disgorgement of any compensation paid during any period of disloyalty or breach of this Agreement). 
 
 G. If a lawsuit is brought that relates to or arises out of this Agreement or my emp l oyment with or termination from the Company, the prevailing party in that lawsuit shall be awarded its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. 
 
 10. Modification & Severability Other Restrictive Covenants.

If a court declines to amend this Agreement as provided herein, the invalidity or unenforceability of any Provision of this Agreement shall 

not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining Provisions, which shall be enforced as if the offending Provision had not been included in this Agreement. 
 
 11. Binding Effect and Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors, assigns, affiliated entities , and any party-in-interest.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, I understand and agree that I may not assign this Agreement. 
 
 12. Survival. The provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of my employment, regardless of the reason for the termination, and the assignment of this Agreement by the Company to any successor in interest or other assignee. 
 
 13. Waiver & Amendment. I agree and understand that a waiver by the Company of the breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach, nor shall recourse to any remedy hereunder be deemed a waiver of any other or further relief or remedy provided for herein. No waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an officer of the Company. The Company shall not be required to give notice to enforce strict adherence to all terms of this Agreement. This Agreement can only be amended or changed in a writing signed by both parties. 
 
 14. Change in Employment. I agree that any subsequent change in my duties, title, salary, or compensa t ion will not affect in any respect the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Agreement.

Such law shall govern regardless of the court or arbitration forum in which a dispute may be adjudicated. 
 
 B. The parties agree that the exclusive and mandatory venue for adjudicating any disputes under this Agreement shall be the federal court or state (or provincial or territorial, as the case may be) court having original jurisdiction for the location in which I last worked for the Company. 
 
 C. The parties hereby consent to jurisdiction in such court for such purpose , and I consent to service of process by mail in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding. The parties further agree not to file any action relating in any way to this Agreement in any court other than as specified in this Section. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if any dispute under this Agreement is subject to resolution by arbitration under an agreement or program agreed to by me and the Company, then such arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive venue for adjudicating such disputes, other than any requests for a temporary restraining order and or a temporary or preliminary injunction pending arbitration, which are reserved exclusively for adjudication in court pursuant to Section 9 above even in otherwise arbitrable disputes. 
 
 I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL OF ITS TERMS. 

I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT, TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT AND TO HAVE A LAWYER OF MY CHOOSING REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT.
