 countries and territories and also through money transfer transactions conducted and funded through websites and mobile applications marketed under the Company s brands Branded Digital and transactions initiated on internet and mobile applications hosted by the Company s third-party white label partners.

The Western Union business consists of the following operating segments: Consumer Money Transfer - The Consumer Money Transfer segment facilitates money transfers, which are primarily sent from retail agent locations worldwide or through websites and mobile devices. The Company s money transfer service is provided through one interconnected global network. This service is available for international cross-border transfers and, in certain countries, intra-country transfers. 

 Consumer Services - The Consumer Services segment includes the Company s bill payment services which facilitate payments for consumers, businesses, and other organizations, as well as the Company s money order services, retail foreign exchange services, prepaid cards, lending partnerships, digital wallets, and media network.

million. The sale was completed in closings, with the entire cash consideration collected at the first closing and allocated to the closings on a relative fair value basis. The final closing for this transaction occurred on July 1, 2023 and resulted in a gain of million.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-recurring fair value adjustments were approximately million for impairments related to the Company's assets in Russia. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , non-recurring fair value adjustments were approximately million for impairments primarily related to software no longer in use. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other Fair Value Measurements The carrying amounts for many of the Company s financial instruments, including certain cash and cash equivalents, settlement cash and cash equivalents, and settlement receivables and obligations approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The Company s borrowings are classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy, and the aggregate fair value of these borrowings was based on quotes from multiple banks. Fixed-rate notes are carried in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at their original issuance values as adjusted over time to accrete that value to par. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value and fair value of the Company s borrowings were million and million, respectively (see Note 11). As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value and fair value of the Company s borrowings were million and million, respectively. 

 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of September 30, 2024, which were primarily held in connection with regulatory requirements, lease arrangements, and certain agent agreements. The Company expects to renew many of its letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration. Litigation and Related Contingencies The Company is subject to certain claims and litigation that could result in losses, including damages, fines, and/or civil penalties, which could be significant, and in some cases, criminal charges. The Company regularly evaluates the status of legal matters to assess whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable in determining whether an accrual is 

 15 

Table of Contents THE WESTERN UNION COMPANY NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) 

 million as of September 30, 2024. For the remaining matters, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate of the possible loss or range of loss because, among other reasons: (i) the proceedings are in preliminary stages; (ii) specific damages have not been sought; (iii) damage claims are unsupported and/or unreasonable; (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved; or (vi) novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories are being asserted. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss, and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established liability or the range of reasonably possible loss. Legal Matters In October 2015, Consumidores Financieros Asociaci n Civil para su Defensa, an Argentinian consumer association, filed a purported class action lawsuit in Argentina s National Commercial Court No. 19 against the Company s subsidiary Western Union Financial Services Argentina S.R.L. WUFSA ). The lawsuit alleges, among other things, that WUFSA s fees for money transfers sent from Argentina are excessive and that WUFSA does not provide consumers with adequate information about foreign exchange rates. The plaintiff is seeking, among other things, an order requiring WUFSA to reimburse consumers for the fees they paid and the foreign exchange revenue associated with money transfers sent from Argentina, plus punitive damages. The complaint does not specify a monetary value of the claim or a time period. In November 2015, the Court declared the complaint formally admissible as a class action. The notice of claim was served on WUFSA in May 2016, and in June 2016 WUFSA filed a response to the claim and moved to dismiss it on statute of limitations and standing grounds. In April 2017, the Court deferred ruling on the motion until later in the proceedings. The process for notifying potential class members has been completed, and the case is in the evidentiary stage. Due to the stage of this matter, the Company is unable to predict the outcome or the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this matter. WUFSA intends to defend itself vigorously. In December 2022, a purported class action complaint was filed against several money transfer business defendants, including the Company, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that these defendants violated the federal Right to Financial Privacy Act and California s Financial Information Privacy Act. The United States Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement were also named as defendants. The original complaint alleged that the defendants violated the plaintiffs financial privacy rights by sharing private financial information with law enforcement agencies through a program coordinated by the Transaction Record Analysis Center. On January 24, 2023, an amended complaint was filed naming the Company's subsidiary Western Union Financial Services, Inc. WUFSI as a defendant in place of the Company. The court granted in part and denied in part WUFSI s motion to dismiss the amended complaint on March 21, 2024. On May 9, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint that re-alleged the state law cause of action against WUFSI, but did not re-allege the federal cause of action against WUFSI. On September 30, 2024, the court granted WUFSI s motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. WUFSI will continue to defend itself vigorously in this matter. In February 2024, another purported class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the Company (doing business as WUFSI) and other defendants on behalf of California residents whose information was sent to the Transaction Record Analysis Center. On April 12, 2024, an amended complaint was filed naming WUFSI as a defendant in place of the Company. Due to the preliminary stage of this matter,

 individuals (the Plaintiffs ), including current and/or former DRC government officials, claim that their privacy rights were violated and sought million in damages. In 2018, the Commercial Court in Kinshasa-Gombe entered a judgment against the Defendants in the amount of million million as of September 30, 2024). In 2019, the Commercial Court in Kinshasa-Gombe entered a judgment against the Company in the amount of million million as of September 30, 2024). The business in the DRC is operated through independent agents. The Plaintiffs have previously sought and may continue to attempt to seize funds from the Company's independent agents in the DRC to satisfy the judgments. The Defendants have learned that certain challenges to the judgments have been denied. The Defendants and the Company intend to continue to challenge both judgments and defend themselves vigorously in these matters. In addition to the principal matters described above, the Company is a party to a variety of other legal matters that arise in the normal course of the Company s business. While the results of these other legal matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect either individually or in the aggregate on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

In addition, from time to time, the Company makes advances to its agents and disbursement partners. The Company often owes settlement funds payable to these agents that offset these advances. These amounts advanced to agents and disbursement partners are included within Other assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , amounts advanced to agents and disbursement partners were million and million, respectively, and the related allowances for credit losses were immaterial. . These securities may be used by the Company for short-term liquidity needs and held for short periods of time. Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. The Company is required to hold highly-rated, investment grade securities and such investments are restricted to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. The Company s investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Western Union regularly monitors credit risk and attempts to mitigate its exposure by investing in highly-rated securities and through investment diversification. Unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related deferred taxes. Available-for-sale securities with a fair value below the amortized cost basis are evaluated on an individual basis to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Factors that could indicate a credit loss exists include but are not limited to: (i) negative earnings performance, (ii) credit rating downgrades, or (iii) adverse changes in the regulatory or economic environment of the asset. Any impairment that is not credit-related is excluded from earnings and presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related deferred taxes, unless the Company intends to sell the impaired security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovering its amortized cost basis. Credit-related impairments are recognized immediately as an adjustment to earnings, regardless of whether the Company has the ability or intent to hold the security to maturity, and are limited to the difference between fair value and the amortized cost basis.

months at inception and a targeted weighted-average maturity of approximately , to help mitigate some of the risk that changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the United States dollar could have on forecasted revenues denominated in other currencies related to its business. As of September 30, 2024 , these foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of a maximum of with a weighted-average maturity of approximately . These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenue, with effectiveness assessed based on changes in the spot rate of the affected currencies during the period of designation and thus time value is excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded components is amortized into Revenues within the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also uses short duration foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities ranging from a few days to , to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on settlement assets and obligations between initiation and settlement. In addition, forward contracts, typically with maturities of less than at inception, are utilized to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated cash and other asset and liability positions. None of these contracts are designated as accounting hedges.

Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities The Company has elected to present derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets; however, derivatives associated with the Company's foreign currency exchange contracts that are subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement would have resulted in an offset of million and million to both derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This includes the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities associated with contracts that include netting language that the Company believes to be enforceable. The Company s rights under these agreements generally allow for transactions to be settled on a net basis, including upon early termination, which could occur upon the counterparty s default, a change in control, or other conditions.

The Company s obligations with respect to its outstanding borrowings, as described above, rank equally. Term Loan Facility On June 25, 2024, the Company entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement providing for an unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate amount of million (the Term Loan Facility ). The Company has until December 15, 2024 to draw upon the Term Loan Facility, which matures on the third anniversary of the initial funding date. The Company has the option to increase the commitments under the Term Loan Facility by an amount such that the commitments do not exceed billion in the aggregate (after giving effect to any such increases). Any such increases would be subject to obtaining additional commitments from existing or new lenders under the Term Loan Facility. The Company plans to use the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility to refinance the Company s issued and outstanding notes due January 2025, to reduce commercial paper balances, and for general corporate purposes. The Term Loan Facility contains covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that, among other things, limit or restrict the Company's ability to sell or transfer assets or merge or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security

 :1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. The Term Loan Facility also contains customary representations, warranties and events of default. Generally, interest under the Term Loan Facility will be calculated using either (i) a rate per annum equal to an adjusted base rate for such interest period or (ii) a rate per annum equal to an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate for such interest period. A ticking fee on the undrawn amount of the Term Loan Facility is also payable quarterly. Both the interest rate margin and ticking fee are based on certain of the Company's credit ratings and will increase or decrease in the event of certain upgrades or downgrades in the Company s credit ratings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the Company's effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year was primarily due to a settlement of the IRS examination of the Company s 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns discussed below, partially offset by the effects of the sale of the Company's Business Solutions business in the prior period s. Unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in Income taxes payable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively, including interest and penalties. The Company s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and various non-United States jurisdictions. The conclusion of the examination of the Company s consolidated federal income tax returns for 2017 and 2018 resulted in both agreed and unagreed adjustments. The agreed adjustments have been reflected in the Company s financial statements, and the Company settled certain of the unagreed adjustments during the third quarter of 2024, which resulted in a tax benefit of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company is contesting the one remaining unagreed adjustment at the IRS Appeals level and has fully reserved for this unagreed adjustment. The statute of limitations for the U.S. federal returns for 2017 and 2018 has been extended to June 30, 2025. The Company s U.S. federal income tax returns since 2020 are also eligible to be examined.

Revenues Overview 
 
 Revenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers to transfer money. These revenues vary by transaction based upon factors such as channel, send and receive locations, pay-in and pay-out method, the principal amount sent, and the difference between the exchange rate we set to the customer and a rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market, when the money transfer involves different send and receive currencies. We also offer other consumer services, for which revenue is impacted by similar factors. 
 
 Due to the significance of the effect that foreign exchange fluctuations against the United States dollar can have on our reported revenues, constant currency results have been provided in the table below for consolidated revenues. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the United States dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year. Constant currency results are also net of the

 impact of Argentina inflation due to its economy being hyperinflationary. We have also disclosed the impact of the Business Solutions divestiture on our revenues in the table below. Constant currency measures and measures that exclude the impact of divestitures are non-GAAP financial measures and are provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, net of the hyperinflationary Argentine economy, and divestitures of our businesses, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. We believe that these measures provide management and investors with information about revenue results and trends that eliminates currency volatility and divestitures, thereby providing greater clarity regarding, and increasing the comparability of, our underlying results and trends. These disclosures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

(a) Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges and Argentina inflation, resulted in an increase to revenues of 5.5 million and a decrease to revenues of 6.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. We calculate Argentina inflation as the revenue growth not attributable to either transaction growth or the change in price (revenue divided by principal). 

(b) Business Solutions revenues included in our results were 29.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

In addition to the impacts from foreign currency, net of Argentina inflation, and the divestiture of our Business Solutions business, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, GAAP and Adjusted revenues decreased due to a reduction in transactions originating from Iraq, which negatively impacted revenues by 7 and 4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior periods. We believe that we will continue to see a reduction in transactions originating in Iraq, compared to prior year periods, in the remainder of 2024 and possibly thereafter primarily driven by changes in monetary policy and related central bank actions. 
 
 Operating Expenses Overview 
 
 Redeployment program 
 
 On October 20, 2022, we announced an operating expense redeployment program which aims to redeploy expenses in our current cost base, accomplished through optimizations in vendor management, our real estate footprint, marketing, and people strategy. We believe these changes will allow us to invest in strategic initiatives. The timing and pace of this redeployment may vary. We have incurred 92.7 million of total expenses under this program from inception through September 30, 2024. 
 
 The following table presents the location and amount of operating expenses associated with our redeployment program in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Cost of Services 
 
 Cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions, which represented approximately 60 of total cost of services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Cost of services decreased compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to decreases in agent commissions, which generally vary with revenue, partially offset by increases in certain variable expenses, including bank fees and credit and non-credit losses, as well as higher employee compensation primarily associated with our expansion of Company-owned locations. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, Cost of services was impacted by a decrease associated with the Business Solutions divestiture. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year due to impairments related to our assets in Russia, as well as an increase in costs associated with our operating expense redeployment program, partially offset by a reduction in employee incentive compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, the increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was also due to fluctuations between the United States dollar and foreign currencies, and an increase in advertising expenditure, partially offset by the Business Solutions divestiture. 
 
 Total Other Expense, Net 
 
 Total other expense, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, was impacted by the gain on the final closing of the Business Solutions divestiture, which occurred on July 1, 2023. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Our effective tax rates on pre-tax income were (95.2) and 16.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (16.5) and 17.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year was primarily due to a settlement of the IRS examination of our 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns, which resulted in a tax benefit of 137.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by the effects of the sale of our Business Solutions business in the prior periods. 
 
 Earnings Per Share 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, both basic and diluted earnings per share were 0.78 and 0.46, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, both basic and diluted earnings per share were 1.61 and 1.33, respectively. Outstanding options to purchase Western Union stock and unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. Shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation were 11.3 million and 9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 11.7 million and 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effect of these shares was anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method, as the assumed proceeds of the options and restricted stock per unit were above our average share price during the periods. 
 
 Earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year were impacted by the previously described factors impacting net income and a lower number of average shares outstanding. 
 
 Segment Discussion 
 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 We manage our business around the consumers and businesses we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our segments addresses a different combination of customer groups, distribution networks, and services offered. Our segments are Consumer Money Transfer and Consumer Services. On August 4, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell our Business Solutions business and the final closing for this transaction was on July 1, 2023. Accordingly, we no longer report Business Solutions revenues and operating expenses after July 1, 2023. Business Solutions revenues included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income were 29.7 million and operating income was 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred costs associated with our operating expense redeployment program, as described above, primarily related to severance and expenses associated with streamlining our organizational and legal structure as well as costs related to the incremental non-cash amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in connection with recent business acquisitions. In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred impairment costs related to our assets in Russia and costs associated with operating the Russian entity, as we have decided to pursue either liquidating or selling these assets. In estimating this impairment, we did not impair the cash that we believe will be necessary to pay for future costs as we work to liquidate and exit the business. While certain of these expenses are identifiable to our segments, the expenses are not included in the measurement of segment operating income provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM for purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation. These expenses are therefore excluded from our segment operating income results. 
 
 Beginning in 2024, we changed our segment reporting methodology to no longer allocate acquisition, separation, and integration costs to our segments. These costs were previously allocated entirely to Consumer Services while it was called Other, and the amounts included in the segment were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The expenses are no longer included in the measurement of segment operating income provided to the CODM for purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation.

Our Consumer Money Transfer service facilitates money transfers sent from our retail agent locations worldwide and money transfer transactions conducted and funded through websites and mobile applications marketed under our brands Branded Digital ). The segment includes five geographic regions whose functions are primarily related to generating, managing, and maintaining agent relationships and localized marketing activities. We include Branded Digital transactions in our regions. By means of common processes and systems, these regions, including Branded Digital transactions, create one interconnected global network for consumer transactions, thereby constituting one Consumer Money Transfer money transfer business and one operating segment.

Table of Contents 

 Transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our Consumer Money Transfer segment. A Consumer Money Transfer transaction constitutes the transfer of funds to a designated recipient utilizing one of our consumer money transfer services. The geographic split for transactions and revenue in the table that follows is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated. Included in each region s transaction and revenue percentages in the tables below are Branded Digital transactions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Where reported separately in the discussion below, Branded Digital consists of 100 of the transactions conducted and funded through that channel. 
 The table below sets forth revenue and transaction changes by geographic region compared to the prior year. Additionally, due to the significance of our Consumer Money Transfer segment to our overall results, we have also provided adjusted revenue results for our Consumer Money Transfer segment revenues, which are net of the impact of foreign currency hedges and Argentina inflation, as discussed above. Consumer Money Transfer segment adjusted revenue growth/(decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure, as further discussed in Revenues Overview above.

(a) Adjusted revenue growth assumes that revenues denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the United States dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the corresponding prior periods. LACA, total Consumer Money Transfer, and Branded Digital adjusted revenue growth excludes the effect of increases in local currency revenue due to inflation in Argentina, which is hyperinflationary. We calculate Argentina inflation as the revenue growth not attributable to either transaction growth or the change in price (revenue divided by principal). 

(b) As noted above, Branded Digital revenues are included in the regions.

Branded Digital, which is included in the regional percentages above, represented approximately 25 and 21 of our Consumer Money Transfer revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 24 and 21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Our consumers transferred 25.9 billion and 26.0 billion in cross-border principal for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 76.4 billion and 76.5 billion in cross-border principal for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Consumer Money Transfer cross-border principal is the amount 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 of consumer funds transferred to a designated recipient in a country or territory that differs from the country or territory from which the transaction was initiated. Consumer Money Transfer cross-border principal is a metric used by management to monitor and better understand the growth in our underlying business relative to competitors, as well as changes in our market share of global remittances. 
 Revenues 
 Consumer Money Transfer revenue decreased 9 and 6 , and transactions increased 3 and 4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of foreign currency hedges and Argentina inflation, negatively impacted revenue by 1 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, in our Consumer Money Transfer regions, NA revenue decreased and was flat, respectively, and transactions increased compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Price reductions and declines in transactions sent within the United States were partially offset by growth in cross-border transactions sent from the United States. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our EU CIS revenues were negatively impacted by price reductions and by one of our retail agents no longer offering cash-based services at its retail locations. Declines in revenue in the MEASA region were driven by a reduction in transactions originating from Iraq primarily driven by changes in monetary policy and related central bank actions, as discussed above. 
 We have historically implemented price reductions or price increases throughout many of our global corridors. We will likely continue to implement price changes from time to time in response to competition and other factors. Price reductions generally reduce margins and adversely affect financial results in the short term and may also adversely affect financial results in the long term if transaction volumes do not increase sufficiently. Price increases may adversely affect transaction volumes, as consumers may not use our services if we fail to price them appropriately. 
 Operating Income 
 Consumer Money Transfer operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year due to a decrease in revenue, as discussed above, partially offset by reduced agent commissions and employee incentive compensation. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating income was negatively impacted by increases in certain variable expenses, including non-credit losses and bank fees, fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, and an increase in advertising expenditure.

Revenues 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, Consumer Services revenues increased primarily due to an increase in retail foreign exchange services, growth in new services we are continuing to introduce to our customers, including media network, and an increase in our money order business. Fluctuations in the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies, net of the impact of Argentina inflation, resulted in an increase to revenue growth of 17 and 6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, relative to the corresponding periods in the prior year. 
 
 Operating Income 
 
 Consumer Services operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year was negatively impacted by expenses associated with our retail foreign exchange services and new services we are continuing to introduce to our customers, including media network, increased investment in information technology, and higher credit losses, partially offset by revenue growth, as discussed above. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, Consumer Services operating income was negatively impacted by a reduction in the reimbursement of expenses associated with the transition services provided after the sale of the Business Solutions business. 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of payments for employee and agent incentives, interest payments on our outstanding borrowings, and timing of income tax payments, among other items. Many of our annual employee incentive compensation and agent incentive payments are made in the first quarter following the year they were incurred. The majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters. The annual payments resulting from the United States tax reform legislation enacted in 2017 (the Tax Act include amounts related to the United States taxation of certain previously undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The final payment is due in the second quarter of 2025. 
 Our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting migrant populations, changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits, including the resolution of outstanding tax matters, and the settlement or resolution of legal contingencies. 
 Substantially all of our cash flows from operating activities have been generated from subsidiaries. Most of these cash flows are generated from our regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use, except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions, including: (i) requirements to maintain cash and other qualifying investment balances, free of any liens or other encumbrances, related to the payment of certain of our money transfer and other payment obligations, (ii) other legal or regulatory restrictions, including statutory or formalized minimum net worth requirements, and (iii) restrictions on transferring assets outside of the countries where these assets are located. 
 We currently believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs, including payments under our debt and other obligations, through our existing cash balances, our ability to generate cash flows through operations, and our 1.25

 billion revolving credit facility Revolving Credit Facility ), which expires in November 2028 and supports our commercial paper program. Our commercial paper program enables us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed 1.25 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of any borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, on June 25, 2024, we entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement providing the capacity to borrow up to 800 million under an unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility ), with the option to increase the commitments under the agreement by an amount such that the commitments do not exceed 1.0 billion in the aggregate (after giving effect to any such increases), subject to certain provisions, as further described below. 
 To help ensure availability of our worldwide cash where needed, we utilize a variety of planning and financial strategies, including decisions related to the amounts, timing, and manner by which cash is repatriated or otherwise made available from our international subsidiaries. These decisions can influence our overall tax rate and impact our total liquidity. We regularly evaluate our United States cash requirements, taking tax consequences and other factors into consideration and also the potential uses of cash internationally to determine the appropriate level of dividend repatriations of our foreign source income. 
 Cash and Investment Securities 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had Cash and cash equivalents of 1,097.6 million and 1,268.6 million, respectively. 
 In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of those transactions. These funds, referred to as Settlement assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments, classified as Cash and cash equivalents within Settlement assets, to fund settlement obligations. 
 Investment securities, classified within Settlement assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, were 1,512.3 million and 1,458.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and consist primarily of highly-rated state and municipal debt securities. These investment securities are held in order to comply with state licensing requirements in the United States and are required to have credit ratings of A- or better from a major credit rating agency. Refer to Part 1, Item 1, Financial Statements , Note 8, Settlement Assets and Obligations for more details regarding investment securities. 
 Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly-rated securities and diversifying our investment portfolio. Our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration. As of September 30, 2024, all investments with a single issuer and each individual security represented less than 10 of our investment securities portfolio. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities decreased to 272.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 518.6 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negatively impacted by higher income taxes paid, including those related to the Tax Act, as further discussed below, as well as refundable deposits made relating to United States federal tax liabilities arising from the examination of our tax returns for the 2017 and 2018 tax years. Excluding the 137.8 million non-cash tax benefit for a settlement of the IRS examination of our 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns, our net income would have decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted in a decrease to cash provided by operating activities. 
 Financing Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings at par value of 2,595.0 million. The significant majority of these outstanding borrowings consist of unsecured fixed-rate notes with maturities ranging from 2025 to 2040.

 On June 25, 2024, we entered into the Term Loan Facility. We have until December 15, 2024 to draw upon the Term Loan Facility, which matures on the third anniversary of the initial funding date. We have the option to increase the commitments under the Term Loan Facility by an amount such that the commitments do not exceed 1.0 billion in the aggregate (after giving effect to any such increases). Any such increases would be subject to obtaining additional commitments from existing or new lenders under the Term Loan Facility. We plan to use the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility to refinance our issued and outstanding 2.850 notes due January 2025, to reduce commercial paper balances, and for general corporate purposes. 
 The Term Loan Facility contains covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer assets or merge or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness, or use proceeds in violation of anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws. The Term Loan Facility requires us to maintain a consolidated Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization interest coverage ratio of not less than 3:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. The Term Loan Facility also contains customary representations, warranties and events of default. 
 Generally, interest under the Term Loan Facility will be calculated using either (i) a rate per annum equal to an adjusted base rate for such interest period or (ii) a rate per annum equal to an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate for such interest period. A ticking fee on the undrawn amount of the Term Loan Facility is also payable quarterly. Both the interest rate margin and ticking fee are based on certain of our credit ratings and will increase or decrease in the event of certain upgrades or downgrades in our credit ratings. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. 
 Our Revolving Credit Facility provides for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of 1.25 billion, including a 250.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest under the Revolving Credit Facility is calculated using either (i) an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or other applicable benchmark based on the currency of the borrowing, plus an interest rate margin determined on a sliding scale from 0.920 to 1.425 based on our credit rating (currently 1.140 or (ii) a base rate plus a margin determined on a sliding scale from 0.000 to 0.425 based on our credit rating (currently 0.140 ). A facility fee on the total amount of the facility is also payable quarterly, regardless of usage, and such facility fee is determined on a sliding scale from 0.080 to 0.200 based on our credit rating (currently 0.110 ). 
 The purpose of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is diversified through a group of 16 participating institutions, is to provide general liquidity and to support our commercial paper program, which we believe enhances our short-term credit rating. The largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of 1.25 billion is approximately 14 . As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. If the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility decreased, or if the Revolving Credit Facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted. 
 Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed 1.25 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. We had 445.0 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Our commercial paper borrowings as of September 30, 2024 had a weighted-average annual interest rate of approximately 5.1 and a weighted-average term of approximately 2 days. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average commercial paper balance outstanding was 632.6 million, and the maximum balance outstanding was 880.3 million. Proceeds from our commercial paper borrowings were used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs, including the settlement of our money transfer obligations prior to collecting receivables from agents or others.

 Cash Priorities 
 Liquidity 
 Our objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital structure consistent with investment-grade credit ratings. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities, access to the commercial paper markets, and our Revolving Credit Facility available to support the needs of our business. 
 Our ability to grow the business, make investments in our business, make acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, including through dividends and share repurchases, and service our debt and tax obligations will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing, and our ability to identify acquisitions that align with our long-term strategy. For additional information, please refer to Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The total aggregate amount paid for purchased and developed software, contract costs, and purchases of property and equipment was 91.8 million and 117.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amounts paid for new and renewed agent contracts vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed contract signings. Other capital expenditures during these periods included investments in our information technology infrastructure. 
 Share Repurchases and Dividends 
 On February 10, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized 1.0 billion of common stock repurchases through December 31, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 13.9 million and 7.8 million shares were repurchased under this authorization for 177.3 million and 100.0 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at an average cost of 12.75 and 12.88, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 170.9 million remained available under this share repurchase authorization. 
 Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of 0.235 per common share in the first, second, and third quarters of 2024, representing 238.9 million in total dividends. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Debt Service Requirements 
 Our 2024 and future debt service requirements will include payments on all outstanding indebtedness, including any borrowings under our commercial paper program. Our next scheduled principal payment on our outstanding notes is in January 2025. We plan to fund this maturity through future borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. 
 2017 United States Federal Tax Liability 
 The Tax Act imposed a tax on certain of our previously undistributed foreign earnings. This tax charge, combined with our other 2017 United States taxable income and tax attributes, resulted in a 2017 United States federal tax liability of approximately 800 million. We elected to pay this liability in periodic installments through 2025 and in the second quarter of 2024, we made an installment payment of 159 million towards this liability. Under the terms of the law, we are required to pay the final installment in the second quarter of 2025 which will total approximately 221 million, including an incremental 22 million from the settlement of the IRS examination for the 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. These payments have affected and will continue to adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity and may adversely affect future share repurchases.

 Operating Leases 
 We lease real properties for use as administrative and sales offices, in addition to transportation, office, and other equipment. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , Note 12, Leases, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for details on our leasing arrangements, including future maturities of our operating lease liabilities. 
 We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
 Other Commercial Commitments 
 We had approximately 60 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of September 30, 2024 primarily held in connection with regulatory requirements, lease arrangements, and certain agent agreements. We expect to renew many of our letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits was 71.5 million, including associated interest and penalties. The timing of any related cash payments for substantially all of these liabilities is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of the settlement of such liabilities are affected by factors which are variable and outside our control. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for which there were no material changes, included: 
 Income taxes 

Goodwill 

Other intangible assets 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements , Note 1, Business and Basis of Presentation for further discussion. 
 Risk Management 
 We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and credit risk related to our agents and customers. A risk management program is in place to manage these risks. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 We provide our services primarily through a network of agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories. We manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of the business and an active risk management process. We currently settle with the significant majority of our agents in United States dollars or Mexican pesos, requiring those agents to obtain local currency to pay recipients, and we generally do not rely on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in other currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid by the next day after they are initiated, and agent settlements occur within a few days in most instances. To mitigate this risk further, we enter into short duration foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities ranging from a few days to one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations between transaction initiation and settlement. We also have exposure to certain foreign currency 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 denominated cash and other asset and liability positions and may utilize foreign currency forward contracts, typically with maturities of less than one year at inception, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on these positions. In certain consumer money transfer transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and a rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market, helping to provide protection against currency fluctuations. We attempt to promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies. 
 We use longer-term foreign currency forward contracts to help mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues denominated in the euro, and, to a lesser degree, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, and other currencies. We use contracts with maturities of up to 36 months at inception to mitigate some of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on forecasted revenues, with a targeted weighted-average maturity of approximately one year. We believe the use of longer-term foreign currency forward contracts provides predictability of future cash flows from our international operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical uniform 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the United States dollar relative to all other currencies in which our net income is generated would have resulted in a decrease/increase to pre-tax annual income of approximately 19 million, based on our forecast of unhedged exposure to foreign currency at that date. There are inherent limitations in this sensitivity analysis, primarily due to the following assumptions: (i) foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous, (ii) fixed exchange rates between certain currency pairs are retained, (iii) the unhedged exposure is static, and (iv) we would not hedge any additional exposure. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income. 
 Interest Rates 
 We invest in several types of interest-bearing assets, with a total value as of September 30, 2024 of approximately 2.3 billion. Approximately 0.9 billion of these assets bear interest at floating rates. These assets primarily include cash in banks, money market investments, and state and municipal variable-rate securities and are included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within Cash and cash equivalents and Settlement assets. To the extent these assets are held in connection with money transfers and other related payment services awaiting redemption, they are classified as Settlement assets. Earnings on these investments will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short-term interest rates. 
 The remaining interest-bearing assets pay fixed interest rates and primarily consist of highly-rated state and municipal debt securities and asset-backed securities. These investments may include investments made from cash received from our money order services, money transfer business, and other related payment services awaiting redemption and are classified within Settlement assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As interest rates rise, the fair value of these fixed-rate interest-bearing securities will decrease; conversely, a decrease to interest rates would result in an increase to the fair values of the securities. We have classified these investments as available-for-sale within Settlement assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and accordingly, recorded these instruments at their fair value with the net unrealized gains and losses, excluding credit-related losses, net of the applicable deferred income tax effect, being added to or deducted from our Total stockholders equity in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Borrowings under our commercial paper program mature in such a short period that the financing is effectively floating rate. As of September 30, 2024, there were 445.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. 
 We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position and the duration of each individual position. We manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs, and improve returns. Our exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest-bearing assets as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). From time to time, we use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to vary the percentage of fixed to floating rate debt, subject to market conditions. As of September 30, 2024, our weighted-average effective rate on total borrowings was approximately 4.0 . 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 At September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease/increase to pre-tax income for the next twelve months of approximately 4 million based on borrowings that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, net of the impact of hedges. The same 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates, if applied to our cash and investment balances on September 30, 2024 that bear interest at floating rates, would result in an offsetting increase/decrease to pre-tax income for the next twelve months of approximately 9 million. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumptions that interest rate changes would be instantaneous and consistent across all geographies in which our interest-bearing assets are held and our liabilities are payable. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes, including changes in credit risk regarding our investments, which may positively or negatively affect income. In addition, the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt and investments and the level of assets and liabilities will change over time, including the impact from commercial paper borrowings that may be outstanding in future periods. 
 Credit Risk 
 To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to investment securities, money market fund investments, derivatives, and other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and financial institutions, we regularly review investment concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads, and credit ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among global financial institutions. 
 We are also exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from agents in the money transfer, bill payment, and money order settlement process. We perform a credit review before each agent signing and conduct periodic analyses of agents and certain other parties we transact with directly. In addition, we are exposed to non-credit losses directly from consumer transactions, particularly through our digital channels, where transactions are originated through means other than cash and are therefore subject to chargebacks, insufficient funds or other collection impediments, such as fraud, which are anticipated to increase as digital channels become a greater proportion of our money transfer business. 
 Our credit and non-credit losses have been less than 3 of our consolidated revenues in all periods presented. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The information under Risk Management in Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 4. Controls an d Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our controls and procedures related to our reporting and disclosure obligations (as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) within the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024, which is the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Review Report of Independen t Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Western Union Company 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 
 We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of The Western Union Company (the Company) as of September 30, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and stockholders equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the condensed consolidated interim financial statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders equity for the year then ended, and the related notes and schedule (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 22, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
