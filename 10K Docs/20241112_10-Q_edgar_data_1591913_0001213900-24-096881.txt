CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Report contains forward-looking statements (as defined in Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act )) that reflect our current expectations and views of future events. The forward-looking
statements are contained principally in the section of this Report entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. Readers are cautioned that significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important
factors (including those over which we may have no control and others listed in this Report and in the Risk Factors section
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K )) may cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You can identify
some of these forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as may, will, expect, anticipate, 
 aim, estimate, intend, plan, believe, is/are likely to, 
 potential, continue or other similar expressions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
on our current expectations and projections about future events that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations,
business strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements include statements relating to: 

our ability to implement
 our business plan, including our ability to launch and generate revenue from our IPSIPay Express joint venture or other digital payment
 solutions we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future; 

acceptance by the marketplace
 of our products and services, notably IPSIPay Express; 

our proposed merger with
 Business Warrior Corporation; 

our ability to formulate,
 implement and modify as necessary effective sales, marketing, and strategic initiatives to drive revenue growth; 

the viability of our current
 intellectual property and intellectual property created in the future; 

our ability to comply with
 currently applicable laws and government regulations and those that may be applicable in the future; 

our ability to retain key
 employees and third-party service providers; 

adverse changes in general
 market conditions for payment solutions such as IPSIPay Express and other products and services we offer; 

our ability to generate
 cash flow and profitability and continue as a going concern; 

our future financing plans
 and ability to repay outstanding indebtedness; and 

our ability to adapt to
 changes in market conditions which could impair our operations and financial performance. 

These
forward-looking statements involve numerous and significant risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that our expectations expressed
in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may later be found to be incorrect. Our actual results of operations
or the results of other matters that we anticipate herein could be materially different from our expectations. Important risks and factors
that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our expectations are generally set forth in the Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, section contain in this Report and in the Business, 
 Risk Factors and other sections of the 2023 Form 10-K. You should thoroughly read this Report and the documents that we
refer to with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from, and worse than, what we expect. We qualify
all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 

The
forward-looking statements made in this Report relate only to events or information as of the date of this Report. Except as required
by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You
should read this Report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we
expect.

INNOVATIVE PAYMENT SOLUTIONS, INC. 

Notes to the unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

, Innovative Payment
Solutions, Inc., a Nevada corporation IPSI or the Company (originally formed on September 23, 2013 under
the name Asiya Pearls, Inc. ), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Qpagos Merger Agreement with Qpagos Corporation, a Delaware corporation Qpagos Corporation ), and Qpagos Merge, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ). Pursuant to the Qpagos Merger Agreement, on May 12, 2016, the
merger was consummated, and Qpagos Corporation and Merger Sub merged (the Qpagos Merger ), with Qpagos Corporation continuing
as the surviving corporation of the Merger. On May 27, 2016, the Company s name was changed from Asiya Pearls, Inc. 
to QPAGOS . 

Pursuant to the Qpagos Merger
Agreement, upon consummation of the Qpagos Merger, each share of Qpagos Corporation s capital stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger was converted into the right to receive two shares of the Company s common stock, par value per
share (the Common Stock ). Additionally, pursuant to the Qpagos Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, the Company
assumed all of Qpagos Corporation s warrants issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, which were exercisable for
an aggregate of approximately shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Qpagos Merger. Prior to and as a condition
to the closing of the Qpagos Merger, a then-current holder of shares of Common Stock agreed to return shares
of Common Stock held by such holder to the Company and such holder retained an aggregate of shares of Common Stock. The
other stockholders of the Company retained shares of Common Stock. Therefore, immediately following the Qpagos Merger,
Qpagos Corporation s former stockholders held shares of Common Stock which represented approximately 
of the outstanding Common Stock. 

The Qpagos Merger was treated as a
reverse acquisition of the Company, then a public shell company, for financial accounting and reporting purposes. As such, Qpagos Corporation
was treated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes while the Company was treated as the acquired entity for
accounting and financial reporting purposes. 

Qpagos Corporation was incorporated
on May 1, 2015 under the laws of the state of Delaware to effectuate a reverse merger transaction with Qpagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. Qpagos
Mexico and Redpag Electr nicos S.A.P.I. de C.V. Redpag ). Each of the entities were incorporated in November
2013 in Mexico. Qpagos Mexico was formed to process payment transactions for service providers it contracts with, and Redpag was formed
to deploy and operate kiosks as a distributor. 

On June 1, 2016, the board of directors
of the Company (the Board changed the Company s fiscal year end from October 31 to December 31. 

On November 1, 2019, the
Company changed its corporate name from QPAGOS to Innovative Payment Solutions, Inc. Additionally, and immediately
following the name change, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect
a reverse split of the then outstanding Common Stock at a ratio of , effective on November 1, 2019 (the Reverse Stock
Split ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each ten pre-split shares of Common Stock outstanding automatically combined into
one new share of Common Stock without any further action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
was reduced from shares to after rounding for fractional shares. 

On December 31, 2019, the Company
consummated the disposal of Qpagos Corporation, Qpagos Mexico and Redpag in exchange for shares (the Vivi
Shares of common stock of Vivi Holdings, Inc. Vivi. or Vivi Holdings pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement
dated August 5, 2019 (the SPA ). Of the shares of Vivi, nine percent was allocated as follows:
Gaston Pereira ), Andrey Novikov ), and Joseph Abrams ). The transactions contemplated by the SPA closed on December
31, 2019 after the satisfaction of customary conditions, the receipt of a final fairness opinion and the approval of the Company s
shareholders. As a result, the Company no longer has any business operations in Mexico and has retained its U.S. operations, currently
based in Carmel By The Sea, California. 

On June 21, 2021, the Company acquired
a strategic interest in Frictionless Financial Technologies, Inc. Frictionless ). Frictionless delivered
to the Company, a live fully compliant financial payment Software as a Service solution for use by the Company as a digital payment platform
(which was subsequently branded as IPSIPay) that enabled payments within the United States and abroad, including Mexico, together with
a service agreement providing a full suite of product services to facilitate the Company s anticipated product offerings. The Company
had an irrevocable right to acquire up to an additional of the outstanding common stock of Frictionless at a purchase price
of for each acquired. 

On August 26, 2021, the Company formed
a new subsidiary, Beyond Fintech, Inc. Beyond Fintech ), in which it owns a stake, with Frictionless owning
the remaining . Beyond Fintech acquired an exclusive license to a product known as Beyond Wallet, to further its
objective of providing virtual payment services allowing U.S. persons to transfer funds to Mexico and other countries.

In connection with preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, management
evaluated the risks described in Note 2(f) above on the Company s business and its future liquidity for the next twelve months from
the date of issuance of these financial statements. 

The accompanying financial statements
for the period ended September 30, 2024 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, but the ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes
a revenue stream and, ultimately, becomes profitable. Management s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional
capital through sales of equity securities and borrowing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful
in accomplishing any of its plans. If the Company is not able to obtain the necessary additional financing on a timely basis, the Company
will be required to delay and reduce the scope of the Company s development and operations. Continuing as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to successfully secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern. 

The Company has determined that there is substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

All references to we, 
 us, our and the Company refer to Innovative Payment Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise. 

Overview 

We are a fintech provider of digital payment solutions presently focused
on, through its participation in IPSIPay Express, developing a new account-to-account payment application called Instant Direct Payments
(which we call IPEX) as well as traditional credit card processing services. We have in the past (under the name IPSIPay) and may in the
future develop and operate e-wallets that enable consumers to deposit cash, convert it into a digital form and remit funds
quickly and securely. 

Known Trends, Demands,
Commitments, Events or Uncertainties Impacting Our Business 

Development of
IPSIPay Express 

Our
principal business as of the date of this Report consists of our participation in the IPSIPay Express joint venture. Since May 2023,
we have been working with our joint venture partners OpenPath and EfinityPay to establish the necessary elements to commercially launch
IPEX. This remains our top business priority. We have been responsible for certain key aspects of establishing and launching IPEX. We
have continued these efforts during 2024. No assurances can be given that we will be able to launch IPEX with our joint venture partners
or that IPSIPay Express will generate revenues for us. 

Merger Agreement with Business Warrior 

On
July 28, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which we would acquire Business Warrior Corporation, a Wyoming
corporation Business Warrior ). See Note 1(c) to the accompanying financial statements for information regarding the terms
and conditions of this proposed merger. 

Business
Warrior offers a proprietary software solution for lenders called PayPlan, a next-generation SaaS platform that offers lenders unprecedented
flexibility to customize their loan offerings and adjust underwriting rules in minutes, without the need for coding or significant financial
outlay. 

We
believe this strategic merger brings together the strengths of both our Company and Business Warrior, creating an expanded fintech offering
and promising immediate cost efficiencies and a stronger executive team capable of raising additional capital. The integration of
our Company with Business Warrior will enable optimization of talent and networks, allowing the teams from both companies to leverage
their experience and connections to drive business growth. The merger also aligns the scalable technologies of our Company and Business
Warrior, paving the way for increased revenue generation and, ultimately, profitability. 

We
expect to spend much of the fourth quarter of 2024 raising capital necessary to seek appropriate shareholder approvals, and seeking such
approvals, for the merger and otherwise fulfilling the conditions to closing of the merger. Among such conditions is an exchange of our
and Business Warrior s outstanding convertible promissory notes for shares of a newly designated preferred stock of our Company
(we have convertible note investors in common with Business Warrior). However, the terms of such exchange and such preferred stock remain
subject to negotiation and approval of our shareholders. Moreover, there are several other key conditions to closing which will be challenging
to fulfill. Therefore, our ability to consummate the merger is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and the merger may never
be consummated. The efforts needed to complete the merger and these risks and uncertainties will affect our results of operations in the
coming periods.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Preparation of our consolidated
financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant accounting
policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results as they require the use of estimates and assumptions which
affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q for further information. 

The critical accounting policies
that involved significant estimation included the following: 

Derivative liabilities 

We have certain short-term
convertible notes and certain warrants which have fundamental transaction clauses which might result in cash settlement. The conversion
feature of these convertible notes and warrants are recorded as derivative liabilities which are valued at each reporting date. 

The derivative liability
is valued using the following inputs: 

Conversion prices; 

Current market prices of
 our equity 

Risk free interest rates; 

Expected remaining life
 of the derivative liability; 

Expected volatility of
 the underlying stock; and expected dividend rates 

Any change in the above factors
such as a change in risk free interest rates, a significant increase or decrease in our current stock prices and a change in the volatility
of our Common Stock may result in a significant increase or decrease in the derivative liability. 

Results of Operations 

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 

Net revenue 

We recorded minimal revenues of 0 and (28) during the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The revenue in the prior year was generated from our legacy IPSIPay platform which was
novated to a third party in September 2023. We pivoted to focus our attention on the IPSIPay Express joint venture, where we expect to
generate initial revenues during the 2024 fiscal year, dependent on product testing, which is currently underway, and market acceptance.
In addition, if the merger with Business Warrior is consummated, we expect to generate revenues from Business Warrior s business
activities. 

Cost of goods sold 

We did not have any revenues
or cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Cost of goods sold was 387 for the three months ended September
30, 2023 and consisted primarily of bank and merchant related fees and chargebacks. 

36 

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses were 296,438 and 745,688 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 449,250 or 60.2 . The decrease is primarily due to the
following: 

(i) 
 Legal fees were 89,334
 and 236,832 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 147,498 or 62.3 . The decrease
 is primarily due to the prior year legal fees related to unfair dismissal matters which were claimed in the prior year by several
 individuals, offset by legal fees incurred on the proposed merger with Business Warrior. 

(ii) 
 Professional fees were
 11,607 and 131,867 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 120,260 or 91.2 . The decrease
 is primarily due to professional fees incurred in the prior year from Frictionless for management fees and customer support fees
 and a decrease in solicitation agent fees incurred in the prior year to support our prior year annual general meeting. 

(iii) 
 Salaries and wages were
 140,087 and 278,345 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 138,258 or 49.7 . the
 decrease is primarily due to the decrease in accrued compensation due to our CEO by 60,000 during the current period and a reduction
 in payroll taxes of 8,704 related to the reduction in payroll and the reduction in stock-based compensation of 62,976 due to the
 full amortization of option expense during the current year. 

(iv) 
 Audit fees were 12,500
 and (23,000) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, an increase of 35,500 or 154.3 , primarily due to a credit
 processed in the prior year for duplicated invoices recorded in the prior year. 

(v) 
 Insurance expense was 317
 and 11,771 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 11,454 or 97.3 . This is primarily
 due to the suspension of insurance coverage during the current period as no business is being conducted during this development phase. 

(vi) 
 Selling and marketing expenses
 were 5,991 and 87,361 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 81,370 or 93.1 .
 the decrease is primarily due the decrease in social media marketing expenses and the decrease in endorsement fees due to Mario Lopez
 which were fully amortized during the current year. 

(vii) 
 The balance of the general
 and administrative expenses was 36,601 and 22,512 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase
 of 14,089 or 62.6 . The increase is made up of several individually insignificant items. 

Depreciation and
amortization 

Depreciation was 543 and 100,387 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 99,844, primarily due to the prior period depreciation of our legacy IPSIPay software
platform and purchased software of 93,095 prior to the novation of such platform to a third party during the prior year. 

Loss on convertible
notes 

Loss
on convertible notes was 4,534,491 and 58,769 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of
 4,475,722. The loss on convertible notes during the current year related to; (i) a loss of 4,318,669 realized on an anti-dilution adjustment
to the conversion feature of certain convertible notes; (ii) a loss of 56,329 realized on the conversion feature of a convertible note
which through a no notice default clause, triggered a variable priced conversion liability; and (iii) a loss of 159,493 realized on
conversion of certain convertible notes at prices lower than the current market price during the current year. In the prior year, the
loss on convertible notes related to the conversion of 135,000 of convertible debt into 391,306 shares of common stock. 

Fair value on
price protected warrants 

Fair value on price protected warrants was 2,051,405 and 0 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the current year the exercise price of certain warrants were reset
due to the anti-dilution price protection and in the case of certain warrants, full ratchet price protection, from an exercise price of
 0.345 to 0.084. This resulted in a Black -Scholes derived valuation difference related to those certain warrants of 2,051,405. 

Penalty on convertible
notes 

Penalty
on convertible notes was 6,611 and 9,306 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a decrease of 2,695 or 29.0 . The
current year penalty arose on certain warrants conversions which were triggered by delayed payments to the note holders, resulting in
the charge of 6,611. 

37 

Loss on novation 

Loss on novation was 0 and 1,066,165 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 1,066,165 or 100 . The prior year loss on novation arose due to the September
2023 transfer of our legacy IPSIPay platform and all rights and obligations associated with the service agreement with Frictionless to
a third party. 

Fair value of warrants
issued 

Fair
value of warrants issued was 0 and 14,176 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 14,176
or 100.0 . We issued a replacement warrant exercisable for 33,334 shares to an investor during the prior period.

expense was 152,376 and 110,328 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 42,048 or 38.1 .
The increase is related to the additional 785,502 of new convertible note funding and 233,333 of promissory note funding during the
current year for working capital purposes. 

Amortization of debt discount 

Amortization
of debt discount was 233,948 and 303,042 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 69,094

, the current year debt discount, and consequent amortization thereof, on new funding is significantly lower than the prior year. 

Derivative liability
movements 

Derivative
liability movements were 5,538,008 and 1,795,642 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a net movement
of 3,742,366 or 72.7 . The derivative liability arose primarily due to the revaluation of certain repriced conversion features on convertible
notes and the reset of the exercise price and full ratchet reset of certain warrants during the current year, and the subsequent mark-to-market
of these derivatives due to a declining stock price on the exercise of certain convertible notes during the current year. 

Net loss from
equity method investment 

Net
loss from equity method investment was 88 and 402,509 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease
of 402,421 or 99.9 . The loss in the prior year related is due to the dilutive effect of withdrawals of cash out of the joint venture
by the other joint venture parties, impacting on the overall value of the. IPSIPay Express Joint venture attributes to the Company. 

Net loss 

Net loss was 1,728,152 and 1,015,143 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 713,009 or 70.2 . The increase is primarily due to the
increase in the loss on convertible notes and the increase in the fair value adjustment on price protected warrants, offset by the decrease
in loss on novation, the decrease in operating loss and the movement in derivative liabilities, as discussed in detail above. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Net revenue 

We did not have any revenues during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and minimal revenues of 410 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The revenue in the prior year was generated from the
IPSIPay platform which was been novated to a third party in September 2023. We pivoted to focus our attention on the IPSIPay Express joint
venture, where we expect to generate initial revenues during the 2024 fiscal year, dependent on product testing, which is currently underway,
and market acceptance. In addition, if the merger with Business Warrior is consummated, we expect to generate revenues from Business Warrior s
business activities. 

Cost of goods sold 

We did not have any revenues
or cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cost of goods sold was 2,756 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 and consisted primarily of bank and merchant related fees and chargebacks. 

38

expenses 

General and administrative expenses were 1,330,367 and 2,753,266
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 1,422,899 or 51.7 . The decrease is primarily due
to the following: 

(i) 
 Legal fees were 307,997
 and 611,178 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 303,181 or 49.6 . The decrease is
 primarily due to the legal matters relating to unfair dismissal matters which were claimed in the prior year by several individuals,
 offset by legal expenses related to the proposed acquisition of Business Warrior. 

(ii) 
 Professional fees were
 35,441 and 583,873 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 548,432 or 93.9 . The decrease
is due to the reduction in professional fees related to services previously provided to us by Frictionless, amounting to 490,293 and
a reduction in proxy solicitation agent fees of 47,069, which were required in the prior year to approve the reverse stock split at
our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. 

(iii) 
 Salaries and wages were
 614,081 and 836,887 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 222,806 or 26.6 . The
decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction in stock-based compensation of 62,976 due to the current-year full amortization
of option expense related to options issued to our management, the decrease in our previous CEO s salary of 120,000 during the
second and third quarter of 2024 and the related decrease in employer related payroll taxes and health insurance costs during the current
year. 

(iv) 
 Audit fees were 105,000
 and 84,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, an increase of 21,000 or 25.0 , primarily due to a credit processed

 Insurance expense was 943
 and 105,067 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 104,124 or 99.1 . This is primarily
 due to the suspension of insurance coverage during the current period as no business is being conducted during this development phase.

 Selling and marketing expenses
were 154,864 and 348,003 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 193,139 or 55.5 . The
decrease is primarily due to the fair value of the prior period immediately vesting warrants granted to Mario Lopez (who performed spokesperson
services for us), offset by the monthly amortization of vesting warrants during the current period, and a reduction in both social media
marketing and marketing expenses related to the launch of our legacy IPSIPay platform and e-wallet in the prior year. 

(vii) 
 The balance of the general
and administrative expenses was 112,042 and 184,258 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

To
date, our primary sources of cash have been funds raised primarily from the sale of our debt and equity securities. 

We have an accumulated deficit
of 61.5 million through September 30, 2024 and incurred negative cash flow from operations of 0.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. Our primary focus is on our IPSIPay Express LLC three-way joint venture to develop and market a proprietary
consumer to merchant real-time payment platform initially focused on the fast-growing online gaming and entertainment sectors. To date,
this joint venture has not generated revenue, but we believe much of the background work necessary for IPSIPay Express to commence revenue
generating operations from payment processing has been completed. No assurances can be given, however, that such revenue generation will
commence or be meaningful to us as an approximately 22 joint venture partner in IPSIPay Express. 

We have also entered into
a merger agreement with Business Warrior as described above and expect to generate revenue from Business Warrior s product offerings
following this merger if the transaction is consummated. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had cash of 1,033 and working capital deficit of 10.3 million, including a derivative liability of 1.6 million.
After eliminating the derivative liability our working capital deficit is 8.7 million. 

We
used cash of 0.5 million and 1.1 million in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Overall
cash used in operations decreased by 0.6 million due to cost containment to preserve cash balances. 

We invested 0.3 million
in Business Warrior in the form of notes receivable for strategic purposes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In the prior
year we had invested 0.1million in our payment platforms which we subsequently disposed of or novated to other parties and we invested
 1.0 million in our equity method investment. 

We
generated cash of 0.8 million from promissory notes and convertible notes and repaid 0.3 million of convertible notes and generated
a further 0.2 million in notes payable during the current period. In the prior year we generated 2.0 million from convertible notes
and repaid 0.2 million. 

At
September 30, 2024, we had outstanding convertible notes, including interest thereon of 4.9 million, net of unamortized debt discount
of 0.2 million and outstanding promissory notes, including interest thereon of 1.4 million, net of unamortized debt discount of 0.06
million. The notes contain certain covenants, such as restrictions on: (i) distributions on capital stock, (ii) stock repurchases, and
(iii) sales and the transfer of assets. The notes bear interest at a rates of 8 to 32.0 per annum. and are convertible into our
common stock at conversion prices ranging from fixed conversion prices of 0.084 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock combinations,
dilutive issuances and similar events), to variable conversion prices of 60 to 70 of lowest trading prices over a 10 to 20-trading
day period. Should the investors choose not to convert these convertible notes, we may need to repay these notes together with interest
thereon which will impact on our liquidity. 

Given
our losses and negative cash flows, we will be required to raise significant additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities
to progress our existing business, complete the Business Warrior merger and grow the combined company (should the merger be consummated)
as planned. Should this occur, our stockholders would experience dilution, perhaps significantly. Additional debt financing, if available,
may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional
equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders and require significant debt service payments,
which diverts resources from other activities. Moreover, there is a risk that financing may be unavailable to support our operations
on favorable terms, or at all. 

There is also a significant risk that none of our plans to raise
financing will be implemented in a manner necessary to sustain us for an extended period of time. If adequate funds are not available
to us when needed, we may be required to continue with reduced or discontinued operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that
may require us to relinquish rights to technologies or potential markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our Company.
In addition, our inability to secure additional funding when needed could cause our business to fail or become bankrupt or force
us to wind down or discontinue operations. 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of the date of this report.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risks 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Exchange Act, our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Executive Chairman Executive
Chairman and our President and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon that
evaluation, our Executive Chairman and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 are not effective
due to a lack of written policies and procedures to address all material transactions and developments impacting our financial statements. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during
our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Our management is committed to improving our controls and procedures
by, among other matters, continuing to consider and adopt appropriate policies and procedures to address all material transactions and
developments impacting our financial statements. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and
our internal control processes, even if improved, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that the breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the
process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

Part II. Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time, we may
become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Below is a description of outstanding
pending litigation matters. As also noted previously, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in the below
described or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Other than as set forth below, we are not presently
a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect
on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. 

Voloshin, et al., v. Innovative Payment Solutions, Inc., et al. 

On October 20, 2021, a complaint
was filed against our Company and certain of its officers and directors with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the
United States Department of Labor OSHA ), captioned Naum Voloshin, Yulia Rey, Alexander Voloshin, Andrey Novikov, and Frank
Perez v. Innovative Payment Solutions, Inc., William Corbett, Richard Rosenblum, Madisson Corbett, Jim Fuller, Cliff Henry and David Rios.
The complaint generally alleged that complainants, four former employees (or independent consultants) of our Company and one employee
who was on suspension, did not receive compensation to which they claim they were entitled and that they were wrongfully terminated for
engaging in protected activities in violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. 1514A. The complaint sought reinstatement
of complainants employment, monetary damages including back pay, raises, bonuses, benefits, overtime, emotional distress and loss
of reputation, orders of abatement and injunctive relief, and costs of litigation. 

In early 2022, OSHA dismissed
the claims of Ms. Rey and Mr. Perez, and they appealed that decision. Prior counsel moved to dismiss the remaining claims and as of this
writing OSHA took no action with respect to that motion as ultimately the former employees elected to proceed in federal court. Pursuant
to agreement and stipulation, dismissal of the OSHA claims was accomplished without prejudice on November 10, 2022. 

On November 7, 2022, the same
five employees filed a lawsuit, not in federal court, but in the California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, against our
Company and the same individuals against whom they had asserted their OSHA claim. The complaint asserted claims for, among other things,
breach of contract, failure to pay wages and failure to reimburse expenses under the California Labor Code and asserting retaliation claims
under the California Labor Code. On December 16, 2022, the same five employees filed an amended complaint dropping all defendants from
the case except Mr. Corbett and our Company. The amended complaint asserts claims for violations of California Labor Code Section 1102.5;
wrongful termination in violation of public policy; breach of contract; breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing; violation of
California Labor Code Section 201; waiting time penalties (Cal. Lab. Code Sections 201 203) and violation of California Labor Code
Section 2802. 

We and Mr. Corbett, the sole
remaining individual defendant, through prior counsel moved to compel arbitration on February 17, 2023. As a result of that motion and
a stipulated order entered by the court, all proceedings in the Superior Court were stayed. 

On June 8, 2023, while our
motion to compel arbitration was pending in the Superior Court three of the employees (Naum Voloshin, Alexander Voloshin, and Novikov)
filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Naum Voloshin, et al., v. Innovative Payment Solutions,
Inc., Case No. CV 23-4515-JFW (PVCx), which alleges a single cause of action for retaliation in violation of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the Federal Action ). The plaintiffs in the Federal Action made no attempt to serve their complaint or to give notice
to any defendant in the Federal Action until August 2023. 

On August 30, 2023, the Hon.
William A. Crowfoot granted our and Mr. Corbett s motion to compel arbitration, concluding that all of the claims alleged in the
former employees first amended complaint were subject to arbitration. The California Court of Appeal subsequently denied the former
employees petition for writ of mandate on November 1, 2023. On December 15, 2023, all five former employees filed a demand for
arbitration. We withdrew our motion to compel appointment of an arbitrator. 

Upon motion of our Company
and Mr. Corbett, on January 10, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California stayed all proceedings in the Federal
Action until the arbitration is completed. 

43 

Plaintiffs Naum Voloshin,
Andrey Novikov, and Alexander Voloshin asserted, in the Federal Action, that they are entitled to damages in the following amounts: Naum
Voloshin: 950,000 plus an unstated amount of lost wages and emotional distress damages. The claim is premised upon Mr. Voloshin earning
 15,000 per month and a claim that he was entitled to receive 333,334 shares of Common Stock (after giving effect to our August 2023 reverse
stock split) on or about June 29, 2021 that he would have sold on July 1, 2021 for 2.85 per share on July 1, 2021 for 950,000. Andrey
Novikov: 285,000 plus emotional distress and punitive damages. The claim is premised upon Mr. Novikov earning 15,000 per month and a
claim that he was entitled to receive 100,000 shares of Common Stock (after giving effect to our August 2023 reverse stock split) on or
about June 29, 2021, that he would have sold at 2.85 per share on July 1, 2021 for 285,000. Alexander Voloshin: 263,000 plus emotional
distress and punitive damages. The claim is premised upon an alleged two-year contract signed in May 2021 that paid him 7,000 per month
and that promised him 333,334 shares of Common Stock (after giving effect to our August 2023 reverse stock split) on or about June 29,
2021. We have not received meaningful information on the amount of the claims of the other two plaintiffs. 

An arbitrator was appointed
through the American Arbitration Association and the arbitrator issued a scheduling order and Notice of Hearing. The ten-day arbitration
has been set for April 7-11, 2025, and April 14-18, 2025. Management continues its vigorous defense of the claims. 

In mid-April 2024, the Company
and Mr. Corbett changed attorneys. The Law Offices of Jeffrey B. Neustadt replaced prior counsel. Mr. Neustadt and Plaintiffs counsel
conferred and timely submitted the required joint statement on April 25, 2024. 

Initial discovery was served
by both sides. Documents were exchanged, and depositions proceeded for 4 persons with three depositions still outstanding, the first scheduled
to be heard on November 20, 2024. 

Minkovich v. Corbett, et al. 

On May 26, 2022, Mr. Jan Minkovich Minkovich filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Los Angeles County (Minkovich v. Corbett, et al., CASE NO. 22CHCV00377)
against our Company and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Corbett. The complaint asserts six causes of action for: (i)
breach of contract; (ii) nonpayment of wages; (iii) waiting time penalties; (iv) failure to indemnify for alleged employee business expenses;
(v) violation of Section 17200 of the California Business and Professional Code; and (vi) wrongful termination of employment in violation
of public policy. Minkovich seeks 570,000 in damages, penalties, and attorneys fees plus shares equal to five percent (5 ownership
of our Company. He bases his claim in part on the unilateral expectation that he receives 2.7 million shares of the Company. Assuming he
is owed any shares, a claim which we dispute, after the reverse 30-1 split he would receive only 90,000 shares. 

Through prior counsel, we
and Mr. Corbett filed a motion to compel arbitration. The motion was denied on October 4, 2022. We and Mr. Corbett then appealed that
decision to the California Court of Appeal. As a result of the appeal, the court case was stayed until the appeal was decided. As a result
of the stay, the demurrer (the equivalent of a motion to dismiss) we filed through prior counsel was not decided. 

On February 27, 2024, the
California Court of Appeal, Second District, reversed the Superior Court s decision denying our motion to compel arbitration. The
Court of Appeal remanded the case to the Superior Court with directions to issue a new order compelling to arbitration the parties 
dispute regarding the enforceability of the arbitration clause. As the prevailing parties, the Company and Mr. Corbett were awarded costs
on appeal. 

As expected, the plaintiff-initiated
arbitration before the American Arbitration Association AAA based on the appellate ruling. While, as the court order states,
the plaintiff may renew his challenge to the arbitration clause before the arbitrator, we believe such challenges are rare and rarely
succeed. Accordingly, we expect the dispute likely will be resolved through AAA arbitration. Management is vigorously defending the claims
and intends to continue to do so. 

In mid-April 2024, the Company
and Mr. Corbett changed attorneys. The Law Offices of Jeffrey B. Neustadt replaced prior counsel. Mr. Neustadt s office submitted
the cost bill and an attorneys fees motion that will be decided on September 10, 2024, by the trial court for the fees incurred
on the successful appeal. As with the Voloshin matter, we are contractually bound to proceed through arbitration and to that end completed
the process of selecting an arbitrator under the AAA rules. That appointment was made on August 7, 2024. Henceforth, the Minkovich matter
will track along the same lines as the Voloshin matter but on a smaller scale as there is only one plaintiff in the Minkovich matter as
opposed to five in the Voloshin matter. The arbitration hearing trial in the Minkovich matter was set for June 30, 2025
to July 3, 2025at the continued preliminary conference held on October 7, 2024. Before the arbitration hearing, the parties
will engage in discovery and some motion work which may (1) either dispose of all or some of the case, and/or (2) result in the Minkovich
matter being sent back to the Superior Court for final determination.
