 (Unaudited) 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which
modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2)
the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income
tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose
their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application
is permitted. This ASU will not have impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The Company
is evaluating the impact to its income taxes reporting disclosures.

The
timing of revenue recognition and billings can result in unbilled receivables (contract assets) or deferred revenue (contract
liabilities). The following table represents changes in our contract asset and contract liabilities balances for the periods noted:
The reduction in deferred revenue from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the substantial completion of
a waste treatment project for a certain customer in which a prepayment was made to the Company by the customer in 2023.

 Change ) 

Accounts Receivable (net) 

The decrease
from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, was primarily due to reduced billing from decreased revenues. The decrease in
accounts receivable was also attributed to the collection by May 2024 of outstanding accounts receivable for work performed for a
certain Canadian project for which a settlement agreement was reached, with collection subject to meeting certain conditions/terms.
(see Note 11 - Perma-Fix Canada Inc. PF Canada ) for a discussion on the collection of the
receivables). 

Remaining
Performance Obligations 

The
Company applies the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information
about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. 

Within
our Services Segment, there are service contracts which provide that the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount
that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance completed to date. For those contracts, the Company has utilized
the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18, which allows the Company to recognize revenue in the amount for which we have the right
to invoice; accordingly, the Company does not disclose the value of remaining performance obligations for those contracts. 

The Company s
contracts and subcontracts relating to activities at governmental sites generally allow for termination for convenience at any time at
the government s option without payment of a substantial penalty. The Company does not disclose remaining performance obligations
on these contracts.

On
May 8, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its Loan Agreement with its lender which provided the following, among other things: 

removed
 the quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio FCCR testing requirement for the
 first and second quarters of 2024; 
 
 reinstated
 the quarterly FCCR testing requirement starting in the third quarter of 2024 and revised
 the methodology to be used in calculating the FCCR as follows (with no change to the minimum
 1.15:1 ratio requirement): FCCR for the third quarter is to be determined based on financial
 results for the three-months period ending September 30, 2024; FCCR for the fourth quarter
 is to be determined based on financial results for the six-months period ending December
 31, 2024; FCCR for the first quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results
 for the nine-months period ending March 31, 2025; and FCCR for the second quarter of 2025
 and each fiscal quarter thereafter is to be determined based on financial results for a trailing
 twelve-months period ending basis; 
 
 required
 maintenance of a daily minimum of in Liquidity (defined as borrowing availability
 under the revolving credit plus cash in the money market deposit account MMDA maintained with the Company s lender) under its Credit Facility through June 29, 2024,
 (which was met by the Company) and a minimum of daily in Liquidity starting June
 30, 2024, through June 29, 2025 (which the Company has met this requirement to date); and 
 
 in
 the event the Company is able to achieve its minimum quarterly FCCR requirement utilizing
 its financial results based on a trailing twelve-months period starting with the quarter
 ending June 30, 2024 (which the Company has not been able to achieve as of September 30,
 2024), the maintenance of a daily minimum Liquidity requirement of as discussed
 above will be removed. Any subsequent fiscal quarter testing of the FCCR will revert back
 to a trailing twelve-months period method. 

In
connection with the amendment, the Company paid its lender a fee of which is being amortized over the remaining term of the Loan
Agreement as interest expense-financing fees. 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowing under its revolving credit and its Liquidity under the Credit Facility was
approximately . 

The
Company s Credit Facility under its Loan Agreement with PNC contains certain financial covenants, along with customary representations
and warranties. A breach of any of these financial covenants, unless waived by PNC, could result in a default under our Credit Facility
allowing our lender to immediately require the repayment of all outstanding debt under our Credit Facility and terminate all commitments
to extend further credit. The Company was not required to perform testing of its FCCR requirement for the first and second quarters of
2024 pursuant to the amendment dated May 8, 2024, to the Company s Loan Agreement as discussed above. The Company was also not
required to perform testing of its FCCR for the third quarter of 2024 pursuant to an amendment dated November 12, 2024, to the Company s
Loan Agreement, as amended (See Note 15 Subsequent Events Credit Facility for a discussion of this amendment
which removed the testing requirement of the FCCR for the third quarter of 2024, among other things). Otherwise, the Company met all
of its other financial covenant requirements in each of the first three quarters of 2024. 

On

 Condition and Results of Operations MD A for the first and second quarters of 2024 and this third quarter
 2024 10-Q. 

Overview 

Our
third quarter financial results were impacted by continued acceleration of our investments and a number of unexpected events/factors
which included the following: 

certain
 waste shipments that were expected to occur in the third quarter of 2024 were pushed into
 the fourth quarter of 2024 by certain government related customers; 
 
 unexpected
 equipment breakdowns that occurred in the latter part of June and during the third quarter
 of 2024 which required replacement or repair in certain of our Treatment Segment facilities
 delayed revenue production. All of the equipment is now back in service; 
 
 weather
 conditions caused by Hurricane Helene resulted in waste shipment delays by certain customers
 at our Florida facility and temporary demobilization of a Services Segment project mandated
 by the customer. This project resumed in early October. Additionally, Hurricane Helene caused
 a temporary shutdown of our Florida facility for approximately one week which impacted revenue
 production; 
 
 continued
 acceleration in investment of our new PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) technology
 which requires significant management and operation support, including the installation of
 our first full scale commercial system in treating PFAS. This system installation also caused production delays
 (see Known Trends and Uncertainties New Processing Technology within
 this MD A for a discussion of this technology); and 
 
 the
 completion of two large projects in the Services Segment in late 2023 were not replaced by
 new projects of similar value. Together, these two large projects had generated significant
 amount of revenue in the third quarter of 2023 when they were in full operational status. 

In
addition to the aforementioned factors, we continue to experience delays in procurements and contract awards from government clients
in the first nine months of 2024. Although we are disappointed with our 2024 financial results for the first nine months of 2024, we
believe our base business is positioned for improvement in 2025 and that our results of operations should improve in 2025. As previously
disclosed, we continue to advance a variety of additional initiatives that are expected to be more fully realized in 2025. These initiatives
include, among other things, positioning ourselves for large and mid-size procurements within the U.S. Department of Energy DOE and U.S. Navy and waste treatment in support of DOE s Hanford closure strategy, continued investments in our facilities and capabilities
to allow for broader waste treatment (including PFAS), and continued expansion of our waste treatment offerings within the international
and commercial markets. 

25 

As
a result of the aforementioned events and factors, our overall revenue decreased by 5,065,000 or 23.2 to 16,812,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024, from 21,877,000 for the corresponding period of 2023. We saw decreases in both segments where Treatment
Segment revenue decreased by 1,731,000 to 9,064,000 or 16.0 from 10,795,000 and Services Segment revenue decreased by 3,334,000
or 30.1 to 7,748,000 from 11,082,000. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately 1,334,000 as compared to gross
profit of 4,549,000 for the corresponding period of 2023, reflecting a decrease in gross profit of approximately 3,215,000 or 70.7 ,
primarily due to decreased revenue in both segments. Selling, General and Administrative SG A expenses decreased
by 301,000 or 7.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023. 

During the third quarter of 2024, we provided a full
valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets (see a discussion of this valuation allowance and the impact to our financial statements
in Results of Operations Income Taxes below). 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, overall revenue decreased by 22,601,000 or 33.7 to 44,415,000 from 67,016,000 for the corresponding
period of 2023 where we saw decrease in revenue in both segments. Treatment Segment revenue decreased by 7,107,000 to 26,116,000 or
21.4 from 33,223,000 and Services Segment revenue decreased by 15,494,000 or 45.8 to 18,299,000 from 33,793,000. The decrease in
revenue within the Treatment Segment was attributed to factors which included among other things, delays in waste shipments by certain
customers due to poor weather conditions and earlier Continuing Resolution CR impacts, temporary outages at our three
primary facilities for equipment replacement and repairs, program enhancement and testing to support permit expansion and broader market
penetration, weather impacts at certain of our treatment facilities resulting in temporary shutdown which limited revenue production
and accelerated investment in R D on our new technology to treat PFAS. Overall lower averaged price from waste mix within the Treatment
Segment also contributed to revenue decrease. The decrease in revenue in the Services Segment was due to slower mobilization and delays
in certain projects from the earlier impact of CR and poor weather conditions. Additionally, the decrease in revenue in the Services
Segment was also attributed to the completion of two large projects in late 2023 which were not replaced by new projects of similar value.
Together, these two large projects had generated a significant amount of revenues in the first nine months of 2023 when they were in
full operational status. Total gross profit for the nine months ended 2024 decreased 12,666,000 or 104.9 due to decreased revenue generated
in both segments. SG A expenses decreased 338,000 or 3.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding
period of 2023. 

Business
Environment 

Our
Treatment and Services Segments business continues to be heavily dependent on services that we provide to U.S governmental clients,
primarily as subcontractors for others who are prime contractors to government entities or directly as the prime contractor. We believe
demand for our services will continue to be subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including, without
limitation, the economic conditions, the manner in which the applicable government will be required to spend funding to remediate various
sites and potential future federal budget issues. In addition, our governmental contracts and subcontracts relating to activities at
governmental sites in the United States are generally subject to termination for convenience at any time at the government s option.
Our Italian contract under our partnership may be terminated by the Contracting Authority under certain conditions as set forth in the
contract. Significant reductions in the level of governmental funding or specifically mandated levels for different programs that are
important to our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 

We
continue to aggressively bid on various contracts, including potential contracts within the international markets.

The
decrease in Administrative SG A expenses was primarily due to lower accrued incentives expenses. In the prior year quarter, approximately
 178,000 in estimated accrued incentive expenses were recorded in connection with the Company s management incentive plans MIPs and other employees bonus plans. Treatment Segment SG A expenses were higher primarily due to higher salaries and payroll
related expenses of approximately 139,000 which were offset by lower outside services expenses of 20,000 from fewer consulting matters
and lower general expenses of 74,000 in various categories. The decrease in Services Segment SG A was primarily due to the following:
salaries and payroll related expenses were lower by approximately 65,000; outside services expenses were lower by approximately 69,000
due to fewer consulting/legal matters; and overall general expenses were lower by approximately 29,000 in various categories. Included

due to lower accrued incentive expenses. Administrative SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2023 included estimated incentives
recorded in the amount of approximately 178,000 in connection with the Company s management incentive plans MIPs and other employees bonus plans. Such incentives were not recorded in the first nine months of 2024; outside services expenses
were lower by approximately 40,000 from fewer consulting/legal matters; and overall general and maintenance expenses were higher by
approximately 71,000. Treatment Segment SG A expenses were higher primarily due to higher salaries and payroll related expenses
of approximately 332,000 which were offset by overall lower travel, outside services and general expenses totaling approximately 179,000.
The decrease in Services Segment SG A was primarily due to lower outside services expenses of approximately 116,000 from fewer consulting

R D 

R D
expenses increased by 183,000 and 532,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the
corresponding period of 2023 primarily due to expenses incurred in connection with our new PFAS technology. 

Interest
Income 

Interest
income increased by approximately 146,000 and 234,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared
to the corresponding period of 2023. The higher interest income for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the corresponding quarter
of 2023 was primarily due to interest income earned from our money market deposit account MMDA that we maintained with
our lender starting in late 2023. 

The
increase in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of 2023 was primarily
due to higher interest income earned from our finite risk sinking fund from higher interest rates that took effect starting in April
2023. Additionally, the increase in interest income resulted from interest income earned from our MMDA that we maintained with our lender
starting in late 2023. The overall increase in interest income from the above was reduced by interest income received in March of 2023
of approximately 60,000 in connection with the Employee Retention Credit refund that we received. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense increased by approximately 32,000 and 157,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared
to the corresponding period of 2023. The increase for each of the periods above was attributed primarily to interest incurred on the
 2,500,000 term loan dated July 31, 2023, under our credit facility and the promissory note that we entered into on July 24, 2024, for
the purchase of our EWOC facility. The higher interest expense was also from more finance leases. 

Income
Taxes 

We
use an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is based on expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities
available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, to determine our quarterly provision for income taxes. 

We
record valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets to the extent we determine it is more likely than not that
such assets will not be realized in the future. We regularly evaluate the probability that our deferred tax assets will be
realized and determines whether valuation allowances or adjustments thereto are needed. This determination involves judgement and
the use of estimates and assumptions, including expectations of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. We apply judgment
to consider the relative impact of negative and positive evidence, and the weight given to negative and positive evidence is commensurate
with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified. Based on our evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence,
and with greater weight placed on the objectively verifiable evidence which included our substantial losses incurred during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, we determined, at the end of the third quarter, that it is more likely than not that our net U.S. deferred
tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we provided a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state deferred
tax assets resulting in a recorded income tax expense in the amount of approximately 6,417,000. We continue to maintain a valuation
allowance against foreign tax attributes that may not be realized. 

We
had income tax expenses of 6,417,000 and 4,300,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and income tax
expenses of 254,000 and 482,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, for our continuing operations.
Our effective tax rates were approximately 268.6 and 36.6 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and
50.8 and 51.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily impacted by the full valuation allowance on our deferred assets as discussed above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
cash flow requirements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily financed by our operations and Liquidity (defined
as borrowing availability under the revolving credit plus cash in our MMDA maintained with our lender) under our Credit Facility. Our
cash included net proceeds received from the sale of 2,051,282 shares our Common Stock to certain institutional and retail investors
in May 2024 (see Financing Activities below for a discussion of this direct offering, including the planned usage of the
proceeds). Our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months will consist primarily of general working capital needs, scheduled principal
payments on our debt obligations, remediation projects, R D on our PFAS technology and capital expenditures which include our PFAS
technology (see Known Trends and Uncertainties New Processing Technology within this MD A for a discussion
of this technology). We plan to fund these requirements from our operations and Liquidity under our Credit Facility. Our ability to utilize
our Credit Facility from our lender is subject to meeting our quarterly financial covenant requirements, among other things. We are continually
reviewing operating costs and reviewing the possibility of further reducing operating costs and non-essential expenditures to bring them
in line with revenue levels. At September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit and our Liquidity under
our Credit Facility was approximately 13,984,000. We believe that our cash flows from operations and our Liquidity should be sufficient
to fund our operations for the next twelve months. Although we believe we should be profitable in 2025, if we continue to incur losses,
such may cause a reduction in our Liquidity.

of approximately 10,567,000. 

Operating
Activities 

Accounts
receivable, net of credit losses, totaled 8,741,000 as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 981,000 from the December 31, 2023, balance
of 9,722,000. The decrease was attributed to reduced billing from decreased revenues which were negatively impacted by a number of events
as previously discussed (See Overview within this MD A). Our accounts receivable was also reduced by the collection
in May 2024 of outstanding accounts receivable for work performed for a certain Canadian project for which a settlement agreement was
reached, with collection subject to meeting certain conditions/terms precedent (see Perma-Fix Canada Inc. PF Canada )
below for a discussion on the collection of the receivables). 

Accounts
payable totaled 7,675,000 as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1,907,000 from the December 31, 2023, balance of 9,582,000. The
decrease in accounts payable was attributed to our overall reduced operations as discussed previously. Additionally, our accounts payable
are impacted by the timing of payments as we are continually managing payment terms with our vendors to maximize our cash position throughout
our segments. 

We
had working capital of 9,424,000 (which included working capital of our discontinued operations) as of September 30, 2024, as
compared to working capital of 4,613,000 as of December 31, 2023. The improvement in our in our working capital was primarily due
to the increase in our cash from the sale of our Common Stock (see Financing Activities below for a discussion of this
direct offering, including the planned usage of the proceeds) which was offset by the significant losses incurred from our results
of operations attributed to the various factors as previously discussed. 

Investing
Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our purchases of capital equipment totaled approximately 2,630,000, of which 406,000 was
subject to financing, with the remaining funded from cash from operations, cash from the equity raise that we completed in May 2024 and
our Credit Facility. We budgeted approximately 2,000,000 for 2024 capital expenditures for our Treatment and Services Segments to maintain
operations and regulatory compliance requirements and support revenue growth. Our capital expenditures for 2024 also included additional
expenditures made to support our PFAS initiatives from cash from our equity raise completed in May 2024. Certain of our 2024 budgeted
projects may either be delayed until later years or deferred altogether. We plan to fund our capital expenditures from cash from operations,
Liquidity under our Credit Facility and/or financing. The initiation and timing of projects are also determined by financing alternatives
or funds available for such capital projects. 

On
July 24, 2024, the Company purchased the property which its EWOC facility operates on pursuant to a Purchase and Sales Agreement for
a purchase price of 425,000. In connection with this transaction, we paid 63,750 in cash and financed the remaining 361,250 of the
purchase price with a bank see Financing Activities below for a discussion of the Note and its terms).

We
agreed to pay PNC 0.5 of the total financing if we pay off our obligations under our Loan Agreement to our lender after July 31, 2024,
to and including July 31, 2025. No early termination fee shall apply if we pays off our obligations under Loan Agreement after July 31,
2025. 

On
May 8, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our Loan Agreement with our lender which provided the following, among other things: 

removed
 the quarterly FCCR testing requirement for the first and second quarters of 2024; 
 
 reinstated
 the quarterly FCCR testing requirement starting in the third quarter of 2024 and revised
 the methodology to be used in calculating the FCCR as follows (with no change to the minimum
 1.15:1 ratio requirement): FCCR for the third quarter is to be determined based on financial
 results for the three-months period ending September 30, 2024; FCCR for the fourth quarter
 is to be determined based on financial results for the six-months period ending December
 31, 2024; FCCR for the first quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results
 for the nine-months period ending March 31, 2025; and FCCR for the second quarter of 2025
 and each fiscal quarter thereafter is to be determined based on financial results for a trailing
 twelve-months period ending basis; 
 
 required
 maintenance of a daily minimum of 2,250,000 in Liquidity under our Credit Facility through
 June 29, 2024, (which was met by us) and a minimum of daily 3,000,000 in Liquidity starting
 June 30, 2024, through June 29, 2025 (which we have met to date); and 
 
 in
 the event we are able to achieve the minimum quarterly FCCR requirement utilizing our financial
 results based on a trailing twelve-months period starting with the quarter ending June 30,
 2024 (which we have not been able to achieve as of September 30, 2024), the maintenance of
 a daily minimum Liquidity requirement of 3,000,000 as discussed above will be removed. Any
 subsequent fiscal quarter testing of the FCCR will revert back to a trailing twelve-months
 period method. 

In
connection with the amendment, we paid our lender a fee of 25,000 which is being amortized over the remaining term of the Loan Agreement
as interest expense-financing fees. 

33 

On
November 12, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our Loan Agreement, as amended, with our lender which provided the following, among
other things: 

removes
 the quarterly FCCR testing requirement for the third quarter of 2024; 
 
 reinstates
 the quarterly FCCR testing requirement starting in the fourth quarter of 2024 and revises
 the methodology to be used in calculating the FCCR as follows (with no change to the minimum
 1.15:1 ratio requirement): FCCR for the fourth quarter is to be determined based on financial
 results for the three-months period ending December 31, 2024; FCCR for the first quarter
 of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results for the six-months period ending March
 31, 2025; FCCR for the second quarter of 2025 is to be determined based on financial results
 for the nine-months period ending June 30, 2025; and FCCR for the third quarter of 2025 and
 each fiscal quarter thereafter is to be determined based on financial results for a trailing
 twelve-months period ending basis; 
 
 extends
 the required maintenance of a daily minimum of 3,000,000 in Liquidity from the ending date
 of June 29, 2025 (and including) to September 29, 2025 (and including); and 
 
 in
 the event the we are able to achieve our minimum quarterly FCCR requirement utilizing our
 financial results based on a trailing twelve-months period starting with the quarter ended
 September 30, 2024, the maintenance of a daily minimum Liquidity requirement of 3,000,000
 as discussed above will be removed. Any subsequent fiscal quarter testing of the FCCR will
 revert back to a trailing twelve-months period method. 

In
connection with the amendment, we paid our lender a fee of 12,500. 

Our
Credit Facility under our Loan Agreement with PNC contains certain financial covenants, along with customary representations and warranties.
A breach of any of these financial covenants, unless waived by PNC, could result in a default under our Credit Facility allowing our
lender to immediately require the repayment of all outstanding debt under our Credit Facility and terminate all commitments to extend
further credit. We were not required to perform testing of our FCCR requirement for the first and second quarters of 2024 pursuant to
the amendment dated May 8, 2024, to our Loan Agreement as discussed above. We were also not required to perform testing of our FCCR requirement
for the third quarter of 2024 pursuant to the amendment dated November 12, 2024, to our Loan Agreement, as amended, as discussed above.
Otherwise, we met all of our other financial covenant requirements in each of the first three quarters of 2024. We expect to meet our
quarterly financial covenant requirements for the next twelve months. 

On
May 21, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional
and retail investors (the Purchasers ), pursuant to which we sold and issued, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate
of 2,051,282 shares of the Company s Common Stock, at a negotiated purchase price per share of 9.75 (the Shares ),
for aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately 20,000,000, before deducting fees payable to the placement agents and other estimated
offering expenses payable by the Company (the Offering ). The net proceeds from the Offering is to fund (i) continued R D
and business development relating to the Company s patent-pending process for the destruction of PFAS, as well as the cost of installing
at least one commercial treatment unit; (ii) ongoing facility capital expenditures and maintenance costs; and (iii) general corporate
and working capital purposes. 

The
Shares were offered and sold by us pursuant to the our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and prospectus supplement
relating thereto. 

34 

Craig-Hallum
Capital Group LLC Craig-Hallum and Wellington Shields Co. LLC Wellington Shields (Wellington Shields
and Craig-Hallum together are known as the Placement Agents served as the exclusive placement agents in connection with
the Offering. We paid the Placement Agents a total cash fee of 6.00 of the aggregate gross proceeds in the Offering, which totaled approximately
 1,200,000. We also reimbursed the Placement Agents certain expenses in connection with the Offering in an aggregate amount of approximately
 80,000. As additional compensation to the Placement Agents in connection with the Offering, we also issued to the Placement Agents and
two (2) of their members designees, warrants (the Placement Agents Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 61,538
shares of Common Stock (the Warrant Shares ), with the aggregate number of Warrant Shares that may be acquired under the
Placement Agents Warrants equal to 3.0 of the number of Shares sold in the registered direct offering, at an exercise price per
share equal to 12.19, which is equal to approximately 125 of the price per share of the Shares sold in the Offering. Neither the Placement
Agents Warrants nor the Warrant Shares have been registered under the Registration Statement or otherwise. The Placement Agents 
Warrants have a term of five years, are exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the four and one-half
(4 year period commencing 180 days from the last date of closing of the Offering which was May 24, 2024, and are exercisable
via cashless exercise in certain circumstances. The aggregate fair value of the Placement Agents Warrants 
was determined to be approximately 331,000 using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: 58.78 volatility,
risk free interest rate of 4.53 , an expected life of five years and no dividend. The aggregate fair market value of the Placement Agent s
Warrants was recorded as an offset to gross proceeds of the Offering and an increase to additional-paid-in capital. 

After
deducting costs incurred of approximately 1,544,000 (exclusive of the aggregate fair market value of the Placement Agents Warrants
as discussed above) which were recorded as a deduction to equity in connection with the Offering, net cash proceeds to us totaled approximately
 18,456,000. We have paid approximately 1,505,000 of the 1,544,000 costs incurred in connection with the Offering. 

On
July 24, 2024, We purchased the property which our EWOC facility operates on pursuant to a Purchase and Sales Agreement dated April 30,
2024, for a purchase price of 425,000. We paid 63,750 in cash and entered into a promissory note dated July 24, 2024, in an amount
of 361,250 with a bank (the lender for the remaining balance of the purchase price, with a maturity date in twenty years
or July 24, 2044 (the Note ). For the first five years starting August 24, 2024, monthly payments under the Note will consists
of approximately 3,100 which include an annual fixed interest rate of 8.10 . Monthly payments under the Note will then be adjusted at
the end of years five, ten and fifteen, with interest calculated based on the weekly average five-year US Treasury Securities Rate plus
3.0 . Under no circumstances will the variable interest rate on the Note be less than 4.0 per annum or more than (except in the case
of default) the lesser of 20.5 per annum or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. We agreed to pay the lender 3.0 of the total
outstanding principal balance under the Note in the event we pays off our obligations during the first year of the Note. The prepayment
penalty rate will be reduced by 1.0 at each subsequent annual anniversary of the Note. No prepayment penalty will apply in the event
we pay off the Note on the fourth anniversary of the Note or thereafter. The property was previously accounted for under our operating
leases. 

Perma-Fix
Canada Inc. PF Canada 

During
the fourth quarter of 2021, PF Canada received a Notice of Termination NOT from Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, LTD. CNL on a Task Order Agreement TOA that PF Canada entered into with CNL in May 2019 for remediation work within Ontario, Canada Agreement ). The NOT was received after work under the TOA was substantially completed and work under the TOA has since
been completed. CNL may terminate the TOA at any time for convenience. At year-end 2023, PF Canada had approximately 2,389,000 in outstanding
receivables due from CNL as a result of work performed under the TOA. A settlement agreement was reached between PF Canada and CNL on
the payment of the aforementioned amount by CNL, subject to certain conditions/terms precedents being met. PF Canada received a partial
payment from CNL of the outstanding receivables during the first quarter of 2024. In May 2024, PF Canada received the remaining approximately
 1,612,000 in outstanding receivables from CNL. As a result of the aforementioned payments received from CNL, no outstanding receivables
remain under the TOA from CNL. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

From
time to time, we are required to post standby letters of credit and various bonds to support contractual obligations to customers and
other obligations, including facility closures. At September 30, 2024, the total amount of standby letters of credit outstanding totaled
approximately 3,950,000 and the total amount of bonds outstanding totaled approximately 20,568,000. We also provide closure and post-closure
requirements through a financial assurance policy for certain of our Treatment Segment facilities through AIG. At September 30, 2024,

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

There
were no significant changes in our accounting policies or critical accounting estimates that are discussed in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

See
 Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the recent accounting pronouncement that will be adopted in future periods. 

Known
Trends and Uncertainties 

Significant
Customers . The contracts that we are a party to with others as subcontractors to the U.S government or directly with the U.S government
generally provide that the government may terminate the contract at any time for convenience at the government s option. Our inability
to continue under existing contracts that we have with U.S. government authorities (directly or indirectly as a subcontractor) or significant
reductions in the level of governmental funding in any given year could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial
condition. We performed services relating to waste generated by U.S government clients, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly
for others as a subcontractor to U.S. government entities, representing approximately 11,749,000 or 69.9 and 31,748,000 or 71.5 of
our total revenues generated during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 14,923,000 or 68.2 
and 52,270,000 or 78.0 of our total revenues generated during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our
partnership s Italian contract may be terminated by the Contracting Authority under certain conditions as set forth in the contract.
The scope of work to be performed in the initial phases of the Italian contract will be performed predominately by our JV partner. Revenue
generated by the Company under the initial phases of the Italian contract will be limited to project management support through 2025
and is not material to date. The Company expects to generate an increase in revenue under the Italian contract starting in 2026 when
the waste treatment phases begin. 

Potential
U.S Government Shutdown. As discussed above, a significant portion of our revenue is generated through contracts entered into indirectly
as subcontractors for others who are prime contractors or directly as the prime contractor to U.S. government authorities. In September
2024, a CR was enacted by Congress to avoid a U.S. government shutdown and provide temporary funding for government operations through
December 20, 2024. If Congress in unable to enact FY 2025 appropriation bills by the deadline of December 20, 2024, or extend the CR,
the U.S. government could enter into shutdown. In the past, even with the enactment of a CR by Congress, there were instances in which
certain of our government clients delayed procurement, waste shipments and project starts due to uncertain budget projections. The full
impact of any government shutdown or further CR is uncertain and could negatively impact our financial results by delays in procurement
actions, contract awards, waste shipments and/or project starts. 

New
Processing Technology. We have completed the fabrication, installation, commissioning and startup of our first full scale
commercial Perma-FAS system System for PFAS (commonly known as forever chemicals destruction at our
Perma-Fix Florida, Inc. facility. Our System and patent-pending technology successfully processed commercial PFAS-containing waste
materials. There are limited current treatment options for these materials, and we expect that our process will exceed any of these
methods. Some of the sizable markets for PFAS include AFFF (aqueous film-forming foam) firefighting foams, both expired concentrate
and flushing liquids, contaminated liquids from PFAS systems, and other water-based separation products from a variety of industrial
systems. We have already secured approximately 6,000 gallons of AFFF liquids to support
ongoing operations and demonstration, and we believe that we will receive an additional 20,000 gallons in the coming months. 

36 

Our
strategy for our System includes continued treatment of PFAS liquids over the coming months and targeting engineering refinements to
support larger-scale Systems. By mid-2025, we expect to advance this technology into pilot-scale applications for soil,
biosolids, and filter media, broadening the reach of our System s destruction capabilities. 

Environmental
Contingencies 

We
are engaged in the waste management services segment of the pollution control industry. As a participant in the on-site treatment, storage
and disposal market and the off-site treatment and services market, we are subject to rigorous federal, state and local regulations.
These regulations mandate strict compliance and therefore are a cost and concern to us. Because of their integral role in providing quality
environmental services, we make every reasonable attempt to maintain complete compliance with these regulations; however, even with a
diligent commitment, we, along with many of our competitors, may be required to pay fines for violations or investigate and potentially
remediate our waste management facilities. 

We
routinely use third party disposal companies, who ultimately destroy, or secure landfill residual materials generated at our facilities
or at a client s site. In the past, numerous third-party disposal sites have improperly managed waste and consequently require
remedial action; consequently, any party utilizing these sites may be liable for some or all of the remedial costs. Despite our aggressive
compliance and auditing procedures for disposal of wastes, we could further be notified, in the future, that we are a PRP at a remedial
action site, which could have a material adverse effect. 

We
have three environmental remediation projects, all within our discontinued operations, which principally entail the removal/remediation
of contaminated soil, and, in most cases, the remediation of surrounding ground water. We expect to fund the expenses to remediate these
sites from funds generated from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had total accrued environmental remediation liabilities of 767,000,
a decrease of approximately 78,000 from the December 31, 2023, balance of 845,000. The decrease represents payments for remediation
projects. At September 30, 2024, 1,000 of the total accrued environmental liabilities was recorded as current. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative
 and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item
 4. 
 Controls
 and Procedures 

(a) 
 Evaluation
 of disclosure controls and procedures. 

We
 maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
 required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
 rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated
 and communicated to our management. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we
 carried out an evaluation with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
 Financial Officer. Based on this recent assessment, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
 Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
 in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were
 not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. 

Material
Weakness 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. In the period ended September 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness related to the precision level needed
in order to properly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. This material weakness resulted in
an income tax valuation adjustment recorded during the quarter. The necessary level of precision was not applied when evaluating the
need for a valuation allowance. The error was corrected by management in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September
30, 2024, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The material weakness noted did not result in a material misstatement
in our previously issued financial statements, nor in the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness 

Our
management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. As it relates to the material weakness identified, we have
enhanced our management and precision level of review control activities in order to evaluate the income tax valuation allowance in subsequent
reporting periods. In addition, if deemed necessary, we will retain a third-party specialist to review management s valuation allowance
conclusions. 

(b)
 
 Changes
 in internal control over financial reporting. 

Other than the identification of the material weakness and the related remediation plan described above, there have
been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
 Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
 our internal control over financial reporting. 

37 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
 Legal
 Proceedings 

There
are no material legal proceedings pending against us and/or our subsidiaries not previously reported by us in Item 3 of our Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, there has been no other material change in legal proceedings previously disclosed
by us in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 1A. 
 Risk
 Factors 

There
is no other material change from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, except as follows: 

The
following additional Risk Factor under Risks Relating to our Business and Operations is as follows: 

We
have sustained losses during 2024. 

The
Company sustained substantial losses during the first nine months of 2024. We believe that our results of operations should substantially
improve in 2025. If, however, we fail to become profitable on an annualized basis in the foreseeable future, this could have a material
adverse effect on our operations, credit facility, liquidity and potential growth. 

The
following additional Risk Factor under General Risk Factors is as follows: 

Failure
to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or failure to remediate a material weakness in internal control over
financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and stock price. 

Maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping
to prevent financial fraud. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed.
We are required to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley and the related rules of the Commission, which require,
among other things, management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 

In
the period ended September 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness related to the precision level needed in order to properly
evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets. This material weakness resulted in an income tax valuation
adjustment recorded during the quarter. The necessary level of precision was not applied when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance.
The error was corrected by management in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024, and for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The material weakness noted did not result in a material misstatement in our previously issued
financial statements, nor in the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have implemented a plan to remediate
this material weakness. 

If
we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and/or remediate any material weakness identified, there
is a reasonable possibility that a misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a
timely manner. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information,
the market price of our Common Stock could decline significantly, and our business, financial condition, and reputation could be harmed.
