 (1) million related to the net fair value adjustment to reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses on August 1, 2024. 
 The Company recognized goodwill of million that is primarily attributed to the expanded presence and long-term growth opportunities in the insurance market provided by this strategic acquisition. Approximately million of the acquired goodwill and intangibles is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. At the date of the acquisition, the Company established a net deferred tax asset of million related to the estimated fair value of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums. 
 Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition are amortized as part of amortization of intangible assets in the Company s consolidated statements of income. The significant fair value adjustments and related future amortization are as follows: 
 Value of business acquired VOBA which represents the present value of the expected underwriting profit within the unearned premium liability, less costs to service the related policies and a risk premium. The fair value of VOBA was determined after taking into consideration certain key assumptions, including the estimated cost of capital, investment yield, loss ratio and related expenses; 

3. Share Transactions 
 
 billion of share repurchases were available under the program. Repurchases under the program may be effected from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2024.

 Certain of the Company s other investments are in investment funds for which the Company has the option to redeem at agreed upon values as described in each investment fund s subscription agreement. Depending on the terms of the various subscription agreements, investments in investment funds may be redeemed daily, monthly, quarterly or on other terms. Two common redemption restrictions which may impact the Company s ability to redeem these investment funds are gates and lockups. A gate is a suspension of redemptions which may be implemented by the general partner or investment manager of the fund in order to defer, in whole or in part, the redemption request in the event the aggregate amount of redemption requests exceeds a predetermined percentage of the investment fund s net assets which may otherwise hinder the general partner or investment manager s ability to liquidate holdings in an orderly fashion in order to generate the cash necessary to fund extraordinarily large redemption payouts. A lockup period is the initial amount of time an investor is contractually required to hold the security before having the ability to redeem. If the investment funds are eligible to be redeemed, the time to redeem such fund can take weeks or months following the notification. 
 Limited Partnership Interests 
 In the normal course of its activities, the Company invests in limited partnerships as part of its overall investment strategy. Such amounts are included in investments accounted for using the equity method and investments accounted for using the fair value option. The Company has determined that it is not required to consolidate these investments because it is not the primary beneficiary of the funds. The Company s maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the Company s consolidated balance sheet and any unfunded commitment.

Of the billion of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2023, approximately million, or , were priced using non-binding broker-dealer quotes or modeled valuations. 
 Fixed maturities 
 The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to estimate the fair value of its fixed maturity securities, when possible. The market approach includes obtaining prices from independent pricing services, such as index providers and pricing vendors, as well as to a lesser extent quotes from broker-dealers. The independent pricing sources obtain market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets. Each source has its own proprietary method for determining the fair value of securities that are not actively traded. In general, these methods involve the use of matrix pricing in which the independent pricing source uses observable market inputs

 The Company did not hold any derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 The Company s derivative instruments can be traded under master netting agreements, which establish terms that apply to all derivative transactions with a counterparty. In the event of a bankruptcy or other stipulated event of default, such agreements provide that the non-defaulting party may elect to terminate all outstanding derivative transactions, in which case all individual derivative positions (loss or gain) with a counterparty are closed out and netted and replaced with a single amount, usually referred to as the termination amount, which is expressed in a single currency. The resulting single net amount, where positive, is payable to the party in-the-money regardless of whether or not it is the defaulting party, 
 unless the parties have agreed that only the non-defaulting party is entitled to receive a termination payment where the net amount is positive and is in its favor. Contractual close-out netting reduces derivatives credit exposure from gross to net exposure. 
 At September 30, 2024, asset derivatives and liability derivatives of million and million, respectively, were subject to a master netting agreement, compared to million and million, respectively, at December 31, 2023.

 CURRENT OUTLOOK 
 
 As we near the end of 2024 and look ahead to 2025, our core objective to deliver long term value for our shareholders remains unchanged. We will continue to execute on the key pillars of our strategy which are: to build a diversified mix of businesses; actively manage the underwriting cycle; remain prudent stewards of the capital entrusted to us by our shareholders; and be dynamic managers of a data-driven enterprise with a culture that attracts best-in-class talent. 
 Overall, the property and casualty environment remains very favorable, despite increasing competition in many of our lines of business. This makes underwriting and risk mitigation increasingly important. Our underwriting strategies empower our businesses to respond quickly to their trading environment. This has been, and remains, a competitive advantage as we pursue those opportunities with the best risk-adjusted returns. 
 A high level of industry catastrophic losses through the third and fourth quarters should continue to support demand for property insurance and reinsurance. Notwithstanding this increased activity, we believe the property market remains attractive where disciplined underwriters can produce attractive returns. On the casualty side, we believe that rates are continuing to outpace loss cost trends, and have selectively increased casualty writings in both the insurance and reinsurance segments. 
 Our property and casualty underwriting teams continued to benefit from attractive market conditions, delivering a combined 269 million of underwriting income and over 5 billion of gross premiums written, up 22 from the 2023 third quarter. 
 Our reinsurance segment contributed 149 million of underwriting income in the 2024 third quarter, despite the higher frequency of catastrophic events. As noted last quarter, due to our view of heightened overall storm risk this year, we chose to not grow our property catastrophe writings at mid-year renewals. Growth was driven by property excluding property catastrophe, including our treaty and facultative businesses, casualty and other specialty lines. 
 Our insurance segment contributed 120 million of underwriting income in the 2024 third quarter. On August 1, 2024, we completed the MCE Acquisition as described in note 2 . As such, the insurance segment s 2024 third quarter results include two months of activity related to the acquired business. This acquisition expands our capabilities for insureds in the middle markets and represents an important component of our growth story in insurance. Excluding the MCE Acquisition, insurance growth was in the mid-single digits and included attractive opportunities in casualty, programs and our London market specialty businesses. 

Premium rates remained competitive in E S property and professional lines. 
 Our mortgage segment continued to deliver a steady level of earnings for our shareholders, generating 269 million of underwriting income in the 2024 third quarter. While new originations remain tempered by relatively high mortgage interest rates, underlying fundamentals remained strong and our U.S. market share was stable as industry pricing discipline held. The persistency of our in force U.S. primary mortgage insurance portfolio remained a healthy 82.9 and the delinquency rate remained low. 
 
 FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 Management uses the following three key financial indicators in evaluating our performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for Arch Capital s common shareholders: 
 Book Value per Share 
 Book value per share represents total common shareholders equity available to Arch divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Management uses growth in book value per share as a key measure of the value generated for our common shareholders each period and believes that book value per share is the key driver of Arch Capital s share price over time. Book value per share is impacted by, among other factors, our underwriting results, investment returns and share repurchase activity, which has an accretive or dilutive impact on book value per share depending on the purchase price. Book value per share was 57.00 at September 30, 2024, compared to 52.75 at June 30, 2024, and 38.62 at September 30, 2023. The 8.1 increase in book value per share for the 2024 third quarter reflected strong investment results. 
 Operating Return on Average Common Equity 
 Operating return on average common equity Operating ROAE represents annualized after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders divided by the average of beginning and ending common shareholders equity available to Arch during the period. After-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Regulation G, represents net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses (which includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains or losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries), equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses,

Table of Contents 

 transaction costs and other and income taxes. Management uses Operating ROAE as a key measure of the return generated to common shareholders. See Comment on Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
 Our annualized net income return on average common equity was 19.0 for the 2024 third quarter, compared to 20.2 for the 2023 third quarter, and 22.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.9 for the 2023 period. Our Operating ROAE was 14.8 for the 2024 third quarter, compared to 24.8 for the 2023 third quarter, and 18.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.7 for the 2023 period. Operating ROAE for the 2024 periods reflected strong underwriting results along with growth in net investment income. 
 Total Return on Investments 
 Total return on investments, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Regulation G, includes investment income, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net realized gains or losses attributable to the investment portfolio and the change in unrealized gains or losses generated by Arch s investment portfolio. Total return is calculated on a pre-tax basis and before investment expenses and reflects the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, total return incorporates the timing of investment returns during the periods. The following table summarizes our total return compared to the benchmark return against which we measured our portfolio during the periods. See Comment on Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
 Arch Portfolio Benchmark Return Pre-tax total return (before investment expenses): 2024 Third Quarter 3.97 4.24 2023 Third Quarter (0.40) (0.36) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 6.20 6.40 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2.68 2.97 
 Total return for the 2024 periods primarily reflected the effects of sustained higher interest rates available in the market, along with growth in invested assets due in part to strong operating cash flows. We continue to maintain a relatively short duration on our portfolio of 2.68 years at September 30, 2024, with average credit ratings of AA- from Standard Poor s Rating Services S P and Aa3 from Moody s Investors Service Moody s). 
 The benchmark return index is a customized combination of indices intended to approximate a target portfolio by asset mix and average credit quality while also matching the approximate estimated duration and currency mix of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Although the estimated duration and average credit quality of this index will move as 

the duration and rating of its constituent securities change, generally we do not adjust the composition of the benchmark return index except to incorporate changes to the mix of liability currencies and durations noted above. The benchmark return index should not be interpreted as expressing a preference for or aversion to any particular sector or sector weight. The index is intended solely to provide a relatively stable basket of investable indices, unlike many master indices that change based on the size of their constituent indices. At September 30, 2024, the benchmark return index had an estimated duration of 2.50 years and an average credit quality of A1 by Moody s. 
 The benchmark return index included weightings to the following indices: 
 ICE BofA 1-10 Year U.S. Corporate Index 
 27.70 Yield on 3-5 Year U.S. Treasury Index plus 6 17.00 ICE BofA 1-10 Year U.S. Treasury Index 15.00 JPM CLOIE Investment Grade 6.00 ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Constrained Index 6.00 ICE BofA 1-5 Year U.K. Gilt Index 5.25 S P 500 Total Return Index 4.75 ICE BofA U.S. ABS CMBS Index 4.50 ICE BofA German Government 1-5 Year Index 3.25 ICE BofA German Government 5-7 Year Index 0.60 ICE BofA 0-3 Month U.S. Treasury Index 3.00 ICE BofA 1-5 Year Canada Government Index 2.55 ICE BofA 15+ Year Canada Government Index 0.30 ICE BofA 1-5 Year Australia Government Index 2.35 ICE BofA U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities Index 1.50 ICE BofA 1-5 Year Japan Government Index 0.25 Total

 COMMENT ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 Throughout this filing, we present our operations in the way that we believe will be the most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use our financial information in evaluating the performance of our company. This presentation includes the use of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders, which is defined as net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses (which includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains or losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries), equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other, income taxes, and the use of

 2024 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q 

Table of Contents 

 annualized operating return on average common equity. The presentation of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized operating return on average common equity are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to net income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized net income return on average common equity (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures) in accordance with Regulation G is included under Results of Operations below. 
 We believe that net realized gains or losses, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other in any particular period are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, our business. Although net realized gains or losses, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses are an integral part of our operations, the decision to realize these items, are independent of the insurance underwriting process and result, in large part, from general economic and financial market conditions. Certain users of our financial information believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of investment gains or losses is largely opportunistic. In addition, changes in the allowance for credit losses and net impairment losses recognized in earnings on our investments represent other-than-temporary declines in expected recovery values on securities without actual realization. Furthermore, we exclude net realized gains or losses from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries, due to their non-recurring nature, such items are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, our business performance. 
 The use of the equity method on certain of our investments is driven by the ownership structure of such funds (either limited partnerships or limited liability companies). In applying the equity method, these investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on our proportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds (which include changes in the market value of the underlying securities in the funds). This method of accounting is different from the way that we account for our other investments and the timing of the recognition of equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method may differ from gains or losses in the future upon sale or maturity of such investments. 
 Transaction costs and other include integration, advisory, financing, legal, severance, incentive compensation and all other transaction costs directly related to acquisitions. We believe that transaction costs and other, due to their non-recurring nature, are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, our business performance. 
 We believe that showing net income available to Arch common shareholders exclusive of the items referred to 

above reflects the underlying fundamentals of our business since we evaluate the performance of and manage our business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting the net income available to Arch common shareholders, we believe that this presentation enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. We also believe that this measure follows industry practice and, therefore, allows the users of financial information to compare our performance with our industry peer group. We believe that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies which follow us and the insurance industry as a whole generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons. 
 Our segment information includes the presentation of consolidated underwriting income or loss. Such measures represent the pre-tax profitability of our underwriting operations and include net premiums earned plus other underwriting income, less losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition expenses and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include those operating expenses that are incremental and/or directly attributable to our individual underwriting operations. Underwriting income or loss does not include certain income and expense items which are included in corporate. While these measures are presented in note 5 , Segment Information, of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements, they are considered non-GAAP financial measures when presented elsewhere on a consolidated basis. The reconciliations of underwriting income or loss to income before income taxes (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis, in accordance with Regulation G, is shown in note 5 , Segment Information of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements. 
 We measure segment performance for our three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. We do not manage our assets by underwriting segment, with the exception of goodwill and intangibles and, accordingly, investment income and other non-underwriting related items are not allocated to each underwriting segment. 
 Our presentation of segment information includes the use of a current year loss ratio which excludes favorable or adverse development in prior year loss reserves. This ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measure to the loss ratio (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) in accordance with Regulation G is shown on the individual segment pages. Management utilizes the current year loss ratio in its analysis of the underwriting performance of each of our underwriting segments. 
 Total return on investments includes investment income, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net realized gains or losses

 (excluding changes in the allowance for credit losses on non-investment related financial assets) and the change in unrealized gains or losses generated by Arch s investment portfolio. Total return is calculated on a pre-tax basis and before investment expenses, and reflects the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, total return incorporates the timing of investment returns during the periods. There is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure for total return. Management uses total return on investments as a key measure of the return generated to Arch common shareholders, and compares the return generated by our investment portfolio against benchmark returns during the periods.

Segment Information 
 We classify our businesses into three underwriting segments: insurance, reinsurance and mortgage. Our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments each have managers who are responsible for the overall profitability of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to our chief operating decision makers. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer are the Company s chief operating decision makers. They do not assess performance, measure return on equity or make resource allocation decisions on a line of business basis. Management measures segment performance for our three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. We do not manage our assets by underwriting segment, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, and accordingly, investment income is not allocated to each underwriting segment. 
 We determined our reportable segments using the management approach described in accounting guidance regarding disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Intersegment business is allocated to the segment accountable for the underwriting results. 
 
 Insurance Segment 
 The Company s insurance segment primarily consists of commercial insurance lines of business, with a focus on specialty insurance products. These products are mainly offered in North America, Bermuda, the United Kingdom, continental Europe and Australia. Products offered in North America include: commercial automobile; commercial multi-peril; other liability claims made, which includes financial and professional lines; other liability occurrence, which includes admitted and excess and surplus casualty lines; property and short-tail specialty; workers compensation; and other. Products offered across the Company s International units include: property and short-tail specialty; and casualty and other.

 Prior Period Reserve Development . 
 The insurance segment s net favorable development was 16 million, or 0.9 points, for the 2024 third quarter, compared to 10 million, or 0.7 points, for the 2023 third quarter, and 31 million, or 0.6 points, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 34 million, or 0.8 points, for the 2023 period. See note 6 , Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, to our consolidated financial statements for information about the insurance segment s prior year reserve development. 
 Underwriting Expenses . 
 2024 Third Quarter versus 2023 Period. The insurance segment s underwriting expense ratio was 31.5 in the 2024 third quarter, compared to 33.4 in the 2023 third quarter. The impact of the MCE Acquisition lowered the underwriting expense ratio by approximately 2.5 points, primarily due to the effects of the fair value estimation of the assets acquired at closing, including the non-recognition of deferred acquisition costs. The value of policies in force at closing are considered within the value of business acquired which is amortized through amortization of intangible assets. The underwriting expense ratio also benefited from an initial lower level of operating expenses in the acquired business. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 versus 2023 period . The insurance segment s underwriting expense ratio was 33.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 34.3 for the 2023 period and reflected the impact of the MCE Acquisition mentioned above. 

Reinsurance Segment

 Bellemeade Re 
 We have entered into aggregate excess of loss mortgage reinsurance agreements with various special purpose reinsurance companies domiciled in Bermuda (the Bellemeade Agreements ). For the respective coverage periods, we will retain the first layer of the respective aggregate losses and the special purpose reinsurance companies will provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding coverage amount. We will then retain losses in excess of the outstanding coverage limit. The aggregate excess of loss reinsurance coverage generally decreases over a ten-year period as the underlying covered mortgages amortize, unless provisional call options embedded within certain of the Bellemeade Agreements are executed or if pre-defined delinquency triggering events occur.

 Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 We establish reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses Loss Reserves which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred. Estimating Loss Reserves is inherently difficult. We utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of Loss Reserves. Actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid will deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Loss Reserves, net of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable, by type and by operating segment were as follows:

 LIQUIDITY 
 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to access sufficient cash flows to meet the short-term and long-term cash requirements of our business operations. 
 Arch Capital is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in its subsidiaries. Generally, Arch Capital depends on its available cash resources, liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries to make payments, including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses it may incur and any dividends or liquidation amounts with respect to our preferred and common shares. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Arch Capital received dividends of 569 million from Arch Re Bermuda, our Bermuda based reinsurer and insurer, which can pay approximately 4.2 billion to Arch Capital during the remainder of 2024 without providing an affidavit to the Bermuda Monetary Authority. 
 We expect that our liquidity needs, including our anticipated (re)insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs, for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter, will be met by funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income, as well as by our balance of cash, short-term investments, proceeds on the sale or maturity of our investments, and our credit facilities. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Total cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 5,100 4,084 Investing activities (4,881) (3,936) Financing activities (35) (52) Effects of exchange rate changes on foreign currency cash and restricted cash 30 (14) Increase (decrease) in cash and restricted cash 214 82 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than in the 2023 period. Activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected a higher level of premiums collected than in the 2023 period. 
 Cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than in the 2023 period. Activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected higher net purchases than in the 2023 period due in part to the investment of operating cash flows. Activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected 852 million of net cash received related to the MCE Acquisition. 

Cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than in the 2023 period, reflecting common share activity.

 Arch MI U.S. is required to maintain compliance with the GSEs requirements, known as the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements or PMIERs. The financial requirements require an eligible mortgage insurer s available assets, which generally include only the most liquid assets of an insurer, to meet or exceed minimum required assets as of each quarter end. Minimum required assets are calculated from PMIERs tables with several risk dimensions (including origination year, original loan-to-value and original credit score of performing loans, and the delinquency status of non-performing loans) and are subject to a minimum amount. Arch MI U.S. satisfied the PMIERs financial requirements with an estimated PMIER sufficiency ratio of 205 at September 30, 2024, compared to 213 at December 31, 2023. On August 21, 2024, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively the GSEs) each updated their Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIERs) to incorporate new deductions to Available Assets for investment risk. This update will become effective March 31, 2025; but the impact will be phased in through September 30, 2026. If the GSEs had fully implemented this update to PMIERs as of September 30, 2024, the changes would have reduced Available Assets by 16 and resulted in a Pro-forma PMIERs Sufficiency Ratio of 173 compared with a reported PMIERs Sufficiency Ratio of 205 . 
 Arch Capital, through its subsidiaries, provides financial support to certain of its insurance subsidiaries and affiliates, through certain reinsurance arrangements beneficial to the ratings of such subsidiaries. Historically, our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance subsidiaries have entered into separate reinsurance arrangements with Arch Re Bermuda covering individual lines of business.

 CATASTROPHIC AND SEVERE ECONOMIC EVENTS 
 
 We have large aggregate exposures to natural and man-made catastrophic events, pandemic events like COVID-19 and severe economic events. Natural catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather, fires, droughts and other natural disasters. Man-made catastrophic events may include acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. Catastrophes can also cause losses in non-property business such as mortgage insurance, workers compensation or general liability. In addition to the nature of property business, we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property, including inflation, property value appreciation and geographic concentration, tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time. 
 Our models employ both proprietary and vendor-based systems and include cross-line correlations for property, marine, offshore energy, aviation, workers compensation and personal accident. We seek to limit the probable maximum pre-tax loss to a specific level for severe catastrophic events. Currently, we seek to limit our 1-in-250 year return period net probable maximum loss from a severe catastrophic event in any geographic zone to approximately 25 of tangible shareholders equity available to Arch (total shareholders 

equity available to Arch less goodwill and intangible assets). We reserve the right to change this threshold at any time. 
 Based on in-force exposure estimated as of October 1, 2024, our modeled peak zone catastrophe exposure was a windstorm affecting the Florida Tri-County regions, with a net probable maximum pre-tax loss of 1.7 billion, or 8 of tangible shareholders equity available to Arch, followed by windstorms affecting the Northeastern U.S. regions and the Gulf of Mexico with net probable maximum pre-tax losses of 1.5 billion and 1.4 billion, respectively. Our exposures to other perils, such as U.S. earthquake and international events, were less than the exposures arising from U.S. windstorms and hurricanes. As of October 1, 2024, our modeled peak zone earthquake exposure (San Francisco earthquake) represented approximately 58 of our peak zone catastrophe exposure, and our modeled peak zone international exposure (Germany windstorm) was substantially less than both our peak zone windstorm and earthquake exposures. 
 We also have significant exposure to losses due to mortgage defaults resulting from severe economic events in the future. For our U.S. mortgage insurance business, we have developed a proprietary risk model Realistic Disaster Scenario or RDS that simulates the maximum loss resulting from a severe economic downturn impacting the housing market. The RDS models the collective impact of adverse conditions for key economic indicators, the most significant of which is a decline in home prices. The RDS model projects paths of future home prices, unemployment rates, income levels and interest rates and assumes correlation across states and geographic regions. The resulting future performance of our in-force portfolio is then estimated under the economic stress scenario, reflecting loan and borrower information. 
 Currently, we seek to limit our modeled RDS loss from a severe economic event to approximately 25 of tangible shareholders equity available to Arch. We reserve the right to change this threshold at any time. Based on in-force exposure estimated as of October 1, 2024, our modeled RDS loss was approximately 1.1 billion, or 5 of tangible shareholders equity available to Arch. 
 Net probable maximum loss estimates are net of expected reinsurance recoveries, before income tax and before excess reinsurance reinstatement premiums. RDS loss estimates are net of expected reinsurance recoveries and before income tax. Catastrophe loss estimates are reflective of the zone indicated and not the entire portfolio. Since hurricanes and windstorms can affect more than one zone and make multiple landfalls, our catastrophe loss estimates include clash estimates from other zones. Our catastrophe loss estimates and RDS loss estimates do not represent our maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates. There can be no assurances that we will not suffer pre-tax losses greater than

 25 of our tangible shareholders equity from one or more catastrophic events or severe economic events due to several factors. These factors include the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers, the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques or as a result of a decision to change the percentage of shareholders' equity exposed to a single catastrophic event or severe economic event. In addition, actual losses may increase if our reinsurers fail to meet their obligations to us or the reinsurance protections purchased by us are exhausted or are otherwise unavailable. See Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Industry and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Catastrophic Events and Severe Economic Events in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
 In accordance with the SEC s Financial Reporting Release No. 48, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings, fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments as of September 30, 2024. Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and is comprised of several components, including liquidity, basis and price risks. 
 An analysis of material changes in market risk exposures at September 30, 2024 that affect the quantitative and qualitative disclosures presented in our 2023 Form 10-K (see section captioned Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management were as follows: 

Investment Market Risk 
 Fixed Income Securities. We invest in interest rate sensitive securities, primarily debt securities. We consider the effect of interest rate movements on the fair value of our fixed maturities, short-term investments and certain of our other investments, equity securities and investment funds accounted for using the equity method which invest in fixed income securities (collectively, Fixed Income Securities and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation. As interest rates rise, the fair value of our Fixed Income Securities falls, and the converse is also true. Based on historical observations, there is a low probability that all interest rate yield curves would shift in the same direction at the same time. Furthermore, at times interest rate movements in certain credit sectors exhibit a much lower correlation to changes in U.S. Treasury yields. Accordingly, the actual effect of interest rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth in the following tables. 
 The following table summarizes the effect that an immediate, parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on our Fixed Income Securities: 
 (U.S. dollars in billions) Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points -100 -50 +50 +100 September 30, 2024 
 Total fair value 41.5 40.9 40.4 39.8 39.3 Change from base 2.7 1.3 (1.3) (2.6) Change in unrealized value 1.1 0.5 (0.5) (1.0) December 31, 2023 Total fair value 33.6 33.1 32.7 32.2 31.7 Change from base 3.0 1.5 (1.4) (2.8) Change in unrealized value 1.0 0.5 (0.5) (0.9) 
 In addition, we consider the effect of credit spread movements on the market value of our Fixed Income Securities and the corresponding change in unrealized value. As credit spreads widen, the fair value of our Fixed Income Securities falls, and the converse is also true. In periods where the spreads on our Fixed Income Securities are much higher than their historical average due to short-term market dislocations, a parallel shift in credit spread levels would result in a much more pronounced change in unrealized value. 

ARCH CAPITAL 61 
 2024 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q

 The following table summarizes the effect that an immediate, parallel shift in credit spreads in a static interest rate environment would have had on our Fixed Income Securities: 
 (U.S. dollars in billions) Credit Spread Shift in Percentage Points -100 -50 +50 +100 September 30, 2024 Total fair value 41.7 41.0 40.4 39.7 39.1 Change from base 3.2 1.6 (1.6) (3.2) Change in unrealized value 1.3 0.6 (0.6) (1.3) December 31, 2023 Total fair value 33.8 33.2 32.7 32.1 31.5 Change from base 3.4 1.7 (1.7) (3.4) Change in unrealized value 1.1 0.6 (0.6) (1.1) 
 Another method that attempts to measure portfolio risk is Value-at-Risk VaR ). VaR measures the worst expected loss under normal market conditions over a specific time interval at a given confidence level. The 1-year 95th percentile parametric VaR reported herein estimates that 95 of the time, the portfolio loss in a one-year horizon would be less than or equal to the calculated number, stated as a percentage of the measured portfolio s initial value. The VaR is a variance-covariance based estimate, based on linear sensitivities of a portfolio to a broad set of systematic market risk factors and idiosyncratic risk factors mapped to the portfolio exposures. The relationships between the risk factors are estimated using historical data, and the most recent data points are generally given more weight. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio s 95th percentile VaR was estimated to be 5.6 , compared to an estimated 7.8 at December 31, 2023. In periods where the volatility of the risk factors mapped to our portfolio s exposures is higher due to market conditions, the resulting VaR is higher than in other periods. 
 Equity Securities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our investments in equity securities and certain investments accounted for using the equity method with underlying equity strategies totaled 1.4 billion and 1.0 billion, respectively. These investments are exposed to price risk, which is the potential loss arising from decreases in fair value. An immediate hypothetical 10 decline in the value of each position would reduce the fair value of such investments by approximately 135 million and 101 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and would have decreased book value per share by approximately 0.36 and 0.27, respectively. An immediate hypothetical 10 increase in the value of each position would increase the fair value of such investments by approximately 135 million and 101 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and would have increased book value per share by approximately 0.36 and 0.27, respectively. 

Investment-Related Derivatives. At September 30, 2024, the notional value of all derivative instruments (excluding foreign currency forward contracts which are included in the foreign currency exchange risk analysis below) was 3.4 billion, compared to 4.2 billion at December 31, 2023. If the underlying exposure of each investment-related derivative held at September 30, 2024 depreciated by 100 basis points, it would have resulted in a reduction in net income of approximately 34 million, and a decrease in book value per share of approximately 0.09 per share, compared to 42 million and 0.11 per share, respectively, on investment-related derivatives held at December 31, 2023. If the underlying exposure of each investment-related derivative held at September 30, 2024 appreciated by 100 basis points, it would have resulted in an increase in net income of approximately 34 million, and an increase in book value per share of approximately 0.09 per share, compared to 42 million and 0.11 per share, respectively, on investment-related derivatives held at December 31, 2023. See note 10, Derivative Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures concerning derivatives. 
 For further discussion on investment activity, please refer to Financial Condition Investable Assets. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Foreign currency rate risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Through our subsidiaries and branches located in various foreign countries, we conduct our insurance and reinsurance operations in a variety of local currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We generally hold investments in foreign currencies which are intended to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our net insurance liabilities. We may also utilize foreign currency forward contracts and currency options as part of our investment strategy. See note 10, Derivative Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

 The following table provides a summary of our net foreign currency exchange exposures, as well as foreign currency derivatives in place to manage these exposures:

 (1) Represents capital contributions held in the foreign currencies of our operating units. 
 (2) Represents the net notional value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. 
 Although we generally attempt to match the currency of our projected liabilities with investments in the same currencies, from time to time we may elect to over or underweight one or more currencies, which could increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and increase the volatility of our shareholders equity. Historical observations indicate a low probability that all foreign currency exchange rates would shift against the U.S. Dollar in the same direction and at the same time and, accordingly, the actual effect of foreign currency rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth above. For further discussion on foreign exchange activity, please refer to Results of Operations. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 General economic inflation has increased in recent quarters and may continue to remain at elevated levels for an extended period of time. The potential also exists, after a catastrophe loss or pandemic events like COVID-19, for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy. This may have a material effect on the adequacy of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, especially in longer-tailed lines of business, and on the market value of our investment portfolio through rising interest rates. The anticipated effects of inflation are considered in our pricing models, reserving processes and exposure management, across all lines of business and types of loss including natural catastrophe events. The actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled and will 

vary by the specific type of inflation affecting each line of business. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Reference is made to the information appearing above under the subheading Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management under the caption Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In connection with the filing of this Form 10-Q, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, for the purposes set forth in the applicable rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation and subject to the below, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 On August 1, 2024, we completed the MCE Acquisition, and we are currently integrating MCE into our internal control process. Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC, we are excluding the internal control over financial reporting of MCE from our evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. MCE represents 5 of total assets, and 2 of our total revenues as of and for the nine months ending September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the item noted above, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 XI. SECTION 12.16 Arbitration is amended to read in its entirety as follows 
 
 Arbitration. Save for where the Company or its Affiliates choose to exercise their rights as described in Section 10.01, any dispute or difference arising out of or relating in any way whatsoever to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration (the Arbitration ).
