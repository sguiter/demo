 In General 
 
 Since June 2022, the Company has focused its efforts on real estate operations. We have no involvement in any aspect of the cannabis industry. In February 2023, we leased a commercial building from a company controlled by our CEO and subleased a portion of the building to a third party. The term of the sublease was one year and the annual rent was 30,000. Effective March of 2024, the sublease became a month-to-month lease for 2,500 per month.

 The total other income (expense) for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 were (460,247) and (4,140), respectively. The other expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024, contained interest expenses - related 
 14 
 
 party of 14,849, loss of 551,677 on the settlement of debt, gain of 106,279 on the amortization of debt premium, while for the three ended August 31, 2023, the other expenses contained only interest expenses - related party of 4,140. The significant increase in other expenses is due to the loss on settlement of debt resulting from a convertible note entered into in order to pay for unpaid rent, related party advances and unpaid interest owed to the related party, where the convertible note was required to be recorded at fair value, thus a premium was recorded at inception and recognized as a loss on settlement of debt. 
 
 Net Loss 
 
 The net loss for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 was 535,086 and 64,757, respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources and Cash Requirements 
 
 As of August 31, 2024, the Company had cash of 25,742. Furthermore, the Company had a working capital deficit of 62,050. 
 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company used 5,320 of cash in operating activities due to its net loss of 535,086 plus its amortization of debt premium of 106,279; offset by depreciation of 1,061, lease cost (net) of 42,770, loss on settlement of debt of 551,677, decrease in prepaid expenses of 18,889, an increase in accounts payable of 6,799 and an increase in accrued expenses of 14,849. 
 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company used 3,270 of cash in operating activities due to its net loss of 64,757; offset by depreciation of 1,061, stock payment for services of 10,000, lease cost (net) of 33,156, decrease in prepaid expenses of 1,500, increase in accounts payable of 11,630, and an increase in accrued interest of 4,140. 
 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company did not have cash in investing activities. 
 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company generated 2,500 of cash in financing activities, which came from 7,500 advances from related party offset by 5,000 of repayment of advances from related party. 
 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company generated 4,500 of cash in financing activities, which came from advances from the related party. 
 
 In its audited financial statements as of May 31, 2024, the Company was issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. Our sources for cash at this time are investments by others, loans and advances from our CEO who is our sole director, and very limited revenue from renting. We must raise cash to implement our plan and stay in business. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 Leases 
 
 The Company follows the accounting for leases under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 842 Lease Accounting and determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases result in 
 15 
 
 operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and operating lease liabilities (short term and long term) being recorded on the Company s balance sheets. 
 
 ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowings over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The Company s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 
 Rent Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company recognizes rent revenue from the lease of its sub-leased properties in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. The sub-lease is categorized as an operating lease according to ASC criteria for the lease definitions. Rent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, reflecting the pattern of the economic benefits derived from the lease. 
 
 The Company s leases generally have fixed rental payments over the lease term, with occasional escalations based on predetermined factors. Rent revenue is recognized monthly as the lessor fulfills its obligations under the lease agreement. 
 
 Any lease incentives or concessions provided to lessees, such as rent-free periods or tenant improvement allowances, are recognized as a reduction of rent revenue over the lease term. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 There have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the three months ended August 31, 2024, that are of significance or potential significance to the Company. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 
 As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 
 16 
 
 1. We do not have an adequate control environment or proper corporate governance - We have no risk assessment, information or communication, or monitoring processes in place and have no policies that require formal written approval for related party transactions. Additionally, the Board of Directors does not operate independently of management. Also, while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 
 
 2. We do not maintain appropriate internal controls - We do not have formal accounting policies and procedures and have not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting. We lack segregation of duties or adequate levels of supervision and review and there are limited accounting resources with the appropriate knowledge of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or SEC experience to ensure the financial reporting is free from material misstatements. 
 
 3. We do not have appropriate information technology controls - We retain copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 
 
 Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 
 
 As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO-2013. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our third fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

17
