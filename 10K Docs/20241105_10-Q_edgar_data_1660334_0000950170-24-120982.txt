 (Unaudited) 
 million. The Company believes its cash, and cash equivalents of million as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to support the Company s planned operations only into the first quarter of 2025. These factors cause substantial doubt to exist about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financial statements are issued. The Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to secure additional capital in the future through equity or debt financings, partnerships, or other sources to carry out the Company s planned commercial and development activities. If the Company is unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, the Company would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate continued commercialization efforts or research and development programs. On July 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the Company borrowed million under the Loan Facility (as defined in Note 10) on July 26, 2023, resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after payment of certain fees and transaction related expenses. Amounts borrowed under the Loan Facility will mature on . P ayments of the principal amount of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, together with a repayment premium and other fees, are not required under the Credit Agreement unless the Company s net revenue attributable to YCANTH on a trailing 12-month basis does not equal or exceed specified amounts for specified test periods as set forth in the Credit Agreement (as amended by the Fifth Amendment described below) (the "Revenue Test") beginning on December 31, 2024. If, on a test date, the Company does not achieve the specified amount of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, then, beginning on the last day of the next full month immediately following the such test date, the Company would be required to repay the outstanding principal amount of the loans on the last day of each month in equal monthly installments through the maturity date, together with the applicable repayment premium and the exit fee. The Company does not anticipate meeting the Revenue Test as of December 31, 2024. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts; material inaccuracy of a representation or warranty; failure to perform or observe covenants; cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness; bankruptcy and insolvency events; material monetary judgment defaults; impairment of any material definitive loan documentation; other material adverse effects; key permit and other regulatory events; key person events; and change of control. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that the Company must maintain a liquidity of at least million and that the Company s quarterly and annual financial statements not be subject to any qualification or statement which is of a going concern or similar nature. The qualification of a "going concern" was waived for the quarterly financial statements ended September 30, 2024. If the qualification of a "going concern" is not waived for additional future periods or if additional financing is not raised to meet the liquidity test, the Company may be in default of the debt agreement in the near-term. Upon the occurrence of an event of default (subject to notice and grace periods), additional interest of 4 per annum applies and obligations under the Credit Agreement could be accelerated. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as amended.

 accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 . Current payment terms for YCANTH (VP-102) range from 30 to 90 days from the shipment date. million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to expiration of Product and label correction on the Product. On July 21, 2023, the Company received FDA approval for YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and began capitalizing inventory purchases of saleable product from certain suppliers. Prior to FDA approval, all product purchased from such suppliers was included as a component of research and development expense, as the Company was unable to assert that the inventory had future economic benefit until YCANTH received FDA approval. Pursuant to the supply agreement (Note 6), the Company purchased and included in research and development expenses approximately million of raw cantharidin and processed active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API"). The raw cantharidin and processed API is sufficient to produce approximately million finished drug product applicators to be used for commercially saleable product and other product candidates. In addition, the Company purchased other components and services related to YCANTH for commercially saleable product and included approximately million in research and development expenses prior to FDA approval. As a result, cost of product revenue related to YCANTH will initially reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials over approximately the next six months as previously expensed inventory is utilized for commercial production and sold to customers. On a pro forma basis, if the Company were to have included those costs previously expensed as a component of cost of product revenue, the Company s cost of product revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been million and million, respectively.

million on previously sold Product to its wholesalers as a result of lower than forecasted sell-through and anticipation of expiration of Product prior to complete sell-through. Government Chargebacks : The Product is subject to pricing limits under certain federal government programs, including Medicare and the 340B drug pricing program. Qualifying entities (the End-Users purchase the Product from the Customers at their applicable qualifying discounted price. The chargeback amount the Company incurs represents the difference between the Company s contractual sales price to the Customers and the end-user s applicable discounted purchase price under the government program. Medicaid Rebates: The Product is subject to state government-managed Medicaid programs, whereby rebates are issued to participating state governments. These rebates arise when a patient treated with the Product is covered under Medicaid, resulting in a discounted price for the Product under the applicable Medicaid program. The Medicaid rebate accrual calculations require the Company to project the magnitude of its sales, by state, that will be subject to these rebates. Patient Assistance: The Company offers a voluntary co-pay patient assistance program intended to provide financial assistance to eligible patients with a prescription drug co-payment required by payors and coupon programs for cash payors. The calculation of the current liability for this assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that the Company expects to receive associated with YCANTH (VP-102) that has been recognized as revenue but remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period. Distribution, Data, and GPO Administrative Fees: Distribution, data, and GPO administrative fees are paid to authorized wholesalers/distributors of the Company s products for various commercial services including contract administration, inventory management, delivery of end-user sales data, and product returns processing. These fees are based on a contractually-determined percentage of the Company s applicable sales.

Diluted net loss per share excludes the potential impact of common stock options, unvested shares of restricted stock and warrants that the Company has issued to OrbiMed and Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

Since the Company had a net loss in each of the periods presented, basic and diluted net loss per common share are the same.

Additionally, the Company is entitled to receive from Torii an additional million in aggregate payments contingent on achievement of specified development, regulatory, and sales milestones, in addition to tiered transfer price payments for supply of product in the percentage range of the mid- s to the mid- s of net sales. The transfer payments shall be payable, on a product-by-product basis, beginning on the first commercial sale of such product and ending on the latest of (a) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim contained in certain licensed patents in Japan that cover such product, (b) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the first indication for such product in Japan, and, (c) (i) with respect to the first product, ten years after first commercial sale of such product, and, (ii) with respect to any other product, the later of (x) ten years after first commercial sale of the first product and (y) five years after first commercial sale of such product. The Torii Agreement expires on a product-by-product basis upon expiration of Torii s obligation under the agreement to make transfer price payments for such product. Torii has the right to terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to us. Additionally, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the agreement by, or insolvency of, the other party. The Company may terminate the agreement in the event that Torii commences a legal action challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patents. On March 7, 2022, the Company executed a Clinical Supply Agreement with Torii, whereby the Company will supply product to Torii for use in clinical trials and other development activities. The Company recognized collaboration revenue of million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to supplies and development activity pursuant to this agreement. The costs of collaboration revenue consists of expenses incurred by the Company for manufacturing supply to support development and testing services pursuant to the Torii Clinical Supply Agreement. On May 14, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Torii Agreement (the First Amendment ). Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company and Torii will equally split the cost of a global Phase 3 clinical trial of YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of common warts (the Trial ), with Torii paying all of the costs when due and the Company repaying Torii half of the costs (the Company Portion ). The results of the global Phase 3 clinical trials will be utilized by the Company in the filing of its new drug application with the FDA for YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of common warts. The Company Portion accrues interest annually at the greater of (i) the one-month SOFR plus and (ii) . Torii may recoup our share of the costs plus applicable interest against any development milestone payments in the Torii Agreement that would otherwise be due to the Company under the terms of the Torii Agreement.

 Overview 
 We are a dermatology therapeutics company developing and selling medications for skin diseases requiring medical intervention. We are primarily focused on developing clinician administered therapies in areas of high unmet need. Our current product portfolio consists of one approved product with several potential follow-on indications, as well as two additional pipeline products. Our commercial product, YCANTH (VP-102) (formerly referred to as VP-102), was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in July 2023 for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in adult and pediatric patients two years of age and older. YCANTH (VP-102) is a proprietary drug-device combination that contains a GMP-controlled formulation of cantharidin. We are also developing YCANTH (VP-102) for potential follow-on indications for the treatment of common warts and external genital warts. Our two additional product candidates are: (i) VP-315 an oncolytic peptide-based injectable therapy for the potential treatment of dermatology oncologic conditions, including basal cell carcinoma, and (ii) VP-103, a second cantharidin based drug device combination for the potential treatment of plantar warts. 
 On July 21, 2023, YCANTH (cantharidin) 0.7 topical solution was the first product approved by the FDA for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in adult and pediatric patients two years of age and older. We commercially launched YCANTH (VP-102) in August 2023 in the United States for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. We have built a specialized sales organization consisting of 35 sales representatives in the United States focused on pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists, and select pediatricians. We also plan to advance YCANTH (VP-102) for common warts and external genital warts through a separate regulatory approval process. We are currently commercializing YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in the United States and in the future we intend to pursue YCANTH (VP-102) for common warts and genital warts if approved. We also will evaluate the expansion of our commercialization efforts in additional geographic regions, either alone or together with a strategic partner. Verrica is continuously reviewing and making changes to its commercialization organization designed to balance sales growth and cost controls based upon distribution and reimbursement coverage for YCANTH (VP-102). 
 We are also developing YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of common warts. In June 2019, we announced positive topline results from our COVE-1 Phase 2 open label clinical trial of YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of common warts. COVE-1 included two cohorts that evaluated the safety and efficacy of YCANTH (VP-102) in subjects with up to six warts. We held a Type C meeting with FDA on clinical development plan for YCANTH (VP-102) common warts indication on November 6, 2023. The meeting and additional extensive regulatory correspondence with the FDA has resulted in gaining in-depth alignment on the design of a pivotal Phase 3 clinical development plan to evaluate YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of common warts. 
 On May 14, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the Collaboration and License Agreement, or the First Amendment, with Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Torii. Pursuant to the First Amendment, we and Torii will equally split the cost of a global Phase 3 clinical trial of YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of common warts, or the Trial, with Torii paying all of the costs when 
 16 

due and we will repay Torii half of the costs, or the Company Portion. The Company Portion accrues interest annually at the greater of (i) the one-month SOFR plus 2 and (ii) 6 . Torii has the right to offset the Company Portion plus applicable interest against certain of the milestone-based payments that would otherwise be due to us under the terms of the Collaboration and License Agreement. In addition, if Torii has not received payment or other recoupment in full of the Company Portion plus applicable interest within 60 months after the date on which Torii made its first payment for the Trial costs, Torii may invoice us for the remained Company Portion plus applicable interest. Torii may recoup our share of the costs plus applicable interest against any development milestone payments in the Torii Agreement. We anticipate the Company and Torii will agree to a Global Study Plan during the fourth quarter of 2024 and the Trial will begin in the first half of 2025. The Company has incurred costs of 0.1 million related to the study during the three month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 In conjunction with the First Amendment, we issued Torii a warrant to purchase up to 500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share of 9.56. The warrant has a term of ten years and is exercisable only with respect to the shares that have vested as of the date of exercise. The shares underlying the warrant will vest as follows: one-third on the date the first patient is dosed in the Trial, one-third on the date that the database lock with respect to the Trial occurs, and one-third on the date the Company submits a new drug application to the FDA for YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of common warts. 
 In addition, we are also developing YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of external genital warts. We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the optimal dose regimen, efficacy, safety and tolerability of YCANTH (VP-102) in patients with external genital warts in June 2019. In November 2020, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 2 clinical trial of YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of external genital warts. An end of Phase 2 meeting was held with the FDA in May 2021. Based on results of the Phase 2 trial, we are evaluating the timing and design of a Phase 3 trial of YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of external genital warts. 
 We also intend to develop our product candidate, VP-315, for basal cell carcinoma and potentially additional dermatological oncology indications. The FDA accepted our investigational new drug application in November 2021. In April 2022, we dosed the first patient in Part 1 of a three-part Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation proof-of-concept trial with a safety run-in designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in subjects with biopsy proven basal cell carcinoma, or BCC. BCC is the most common form of cancer in the United States, and incidence is rising worldwide. There are approximately 3.6 million diagnoses of BCCs in the United States each year, with a high unmet need for new treatment options. More than one out of every three new cancers are skin cancers, and the vast majority are BCCs. In 2021, the estimated global BCC market was 6.7 billion, which is expected to grow to 11.5 billion in 2028. Mohs micrographic surgery is considered the most effective technique for treating BCCs with over 700,000 procedures in the United States annually. We believe VP-315 has the potential to be a non-surgical alternative for the treatment of BCC. 
 In Part 1 of the trial, VP-315 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no reported serious adverse events. We initiated Part 2 of the trial in April 2023. In June 2023, the protocol was amended to remove Part 3 of the trial and to expand Part 2. The trial enrolled 92 adult subjects with a histological diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma in at least one eligible target lesion. The last patient in Part 2 of the trial was dosed in December 2023. We announced preliminary positive results in August 2024 based on 93 confirmed basal cell carcinoma lesions that were treated during Part 2 of the trial; however, for histologic reduction in tumor size and overall reduction in tumor size, data from three of the 93 lesions are pending. Based on the preliminary results, VP-315 was well tolerated with no reported treatment-related serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities (n=93). Most treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate cutaneous reactions. The overall reduction in tumor size of 90 of the lesions treated in Part 2 of the trial was approximately 86 . Approximately 51 of all lesions treated in Part 2 of the trial achieved complete histological clearance, with no residual tumor cells (n=93), and patients with residual tumor on average achieved an approximate 71 reduction in tumor size (n=90).We expect genomic and T-cell (immune response) data from the trial in the first quarter of 2025 and plan to request an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to determine next steps for the development of VP-315 for the treatment of BCC in the first half of 2025. 
 In addition, we have conducted necessary drug development activities for VP-103, our second cantharidin-based product candidate, and are evaluating when to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of plantar warts. 
 On October 1, 2024, we reduced our workforce by terminating 47 employees, or the Restructuring, to reduce costs and optimize the efficiency of our field sales force. We will reduce the number of sales territories from 80 to approximately 33, with a focus on those territories that have historically shown a high prevalence of molluscum. The Restructuring was completed on October 1, 2024. In connection with the Restructuring, we expect to incur a one-time charge totaling approximately 0.6 million related to one-time employee termination costs In addition, we recognized an impairment charge for right-of-use assets associated with leased vehicles of 0.3 million during the three months ending September 30, 2024 in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This restructuring charge will substantially be paid out by December 31, 2024. 
 Since our inception in 2013, our operations have focused on developing YCANTH (VP-102), organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting clinical trials. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity and equity-linked securities and through borrowings under loan agreements. 
 17 

On July 26, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement with OrbiMed, or the Initial Lender, and each other lender that may from time to time become a party thereto, or the Lenders, pursuant to which we borrowed 50.0 million on July 26, 2023, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 44.1 million after payment of certain fees and transaction related expenses. Amounts borrowed under the Loan Facility will mature on July 26, 2028. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts; material inaccuracy of a representation or warranty; failure to perform or observe covenants; cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness; bankruptcy and insolvency events; material monetary judgment defaults; impairment of any material definitive loan documentation; other material adverse effects; key permit and other regulatory events; key person events; and change of control. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that we must maintain a liquidity of at least 10.0 million and that our quarterly and annual financial statements not be subject to any qualification or statement which is of a going concern or similar nature. The qualification of a "going concern" was waived for the quarterly financial statements ended September 30, 2024. Upon the occurrence of an event of default (subject to notice and grace periods), additional interest of 4 per annum applies and obligations under the Credit Agreement could be accelerated. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as amended. As part of the Loan Facility, we issued the Initial Lender a warrant to purchase up to 518,551 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of 6.0264 per share, which have a term of 10 years from the issuance date. 
 In February 2023, we closed an underwritten offering of 750,000 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 4,064,814 shares of common stock, of which 2.583,333 were exercised were exercised resulting in net shares issued of 2,583,242 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The shares of common stock were sold in the underwritten offering at a price of 6.75 per share and the pre-funded warrants were sold at a price of 6.7499 per pre-funded warrant, resulting in total net proceeds of 30.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering expenses. 
 Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was 60.4 million and 42.4 million, respectively. The increase in loss is primarily due to significant commercial expenditures to support the launch and future growth of YCANTH (VP-102) compounded by slower than expected revenue growth. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 290.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses may increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: 
 continue commercialization of YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum; 

continue our ongoing clinical program evaluating VP-315 for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and potentially additional dermatological oncology indications; 

continue our ongoing clinical programs evaluating YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of common warts and external genital warts, as well as initiate and complete additional clinical trials, as needed; 

initiate clinical trials evaluating VP-103 for the treatment of plantar warts; 

pursue regulatory approvals for YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of common warts, external genital warts, or any other indications we may pursue for YCANTH (VP-102), VP-315 or VP -103; 

seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; 

further establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and any other product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, including YCANTH for external genital warts and common warts, VP- 315 and VP-103; 

seek to in-license or acquire additional product candidates for other dermatological conditions; 

adapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products; 

maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

hire additional commercial, administrative, clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel; 

add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned commercialization efforts; and 

incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses while operating as a public company. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to 
 18 

make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 
 A summary of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. However, we believe that the additional accounting policies disclosed in Note 2 to our financial statements are important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Product Revenue, Net 
 We recognize revenue from sales of YCANTH (VP-102), or the Product, in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. YCANTH (VP-102) became available for commercial sale and shipment for the treatment of patients by a healthcare provider in the United States in the year ended December 31, 2023. We sell the Product to several pharmaceutical wholesaler/distributors, or the Customers, who in turn sell the Product directly to clinics, hospitals, and federal healthcare programs. Revenue is recognized as the Product is physically delivered to the Customers. 
 Gross product sales are reduced by corresponding gross-to-net, or GTN, estimates using the expected value method, resulting in our reported Product revenue, net in the accompanying statements of operations. Product revenue, net reflects the amount we ultimately expect to realize in net cash proceeds, taking into account the current period gross sales and related cash receipts and the subsequent cash disbursements on these sales that we estimate for the various GTN categories as well as adjustments for any potential future product returns from distributors. The GTN estimates are based upon information received from external sources, such as written or oral information obtained from our customers with respect to their period-end inventory levels and sales to end-users during the period, in combination with management s informed judgments. Due to the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, the actual amount of product returns, government chargebacks, prompt pay discounts, commercial rebates, Medicaid rebates, co-pay assistance and distribution, data, and group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, administrative fees may be materially above or below the amount estimated. Variance between actual amounts and estimated amounts may result in prospective adjustments to reported net product revenue. 
 YCANTH (VP-102) may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success . 
 Collaboration Revenue 
 Collaboration revenue represents revenue from the Torii Agreement pursuant to which we granted Torii an exclusive license to develop and commercialize our product candidates that contain a topical formulation of cantharidin for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and common warts in Japan, including YCANTH (VP-102). 
 Operating Expenses 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in sales, executive and administrative functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include cost of samples, sponsorships, consumer and health care professional marketing and advertising expense, insurance costs, and professional fees for audit, tax and legal services. 
 We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses, including payroll and related expenses, will change in the future due to the Restructuring and as we continue to evaluate our headcount to support the expected growth in our business, modify our operations and organizational capabilities, and continue to commercialize YCANTH (VP-102). We also anticipate increased expenses associated with general operations, including costs related to audit, tax and legal services, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum, potential follow-on indications for YCANTH (VP-102), including common warts and external genital warts, VP-315, and our other product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include: 
 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies; 

manufacturing and supply scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial supply and commercial supply, including manufacturing validation batches; 

19 

outsourced professional scientific development services; 

employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; 

expenses relating to regulatory activities; and 

laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities. 

Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, initiate and conduct clinical trials of YCANTH (VP-102) in patients with common warts, YCANTH (VP-102) in patients with external genital warts, VP-315 for basal cell carcinoma and potentially additional dermatological oncology indications,VP-103 in patients with plantar warts, and conduct other clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings for our product candidates. 
 The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from YCANTH (VP-102) or our other product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including: 
 the number of clinical sites included in the trials; 

the length of time required to enroll suitable patients; 

the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials; 

the number of doses patients receive; 

the duration of patient follow-up; and 

the results of our clinical trials. 

Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the manufacturing process for our product candidates, the terms and timing of regulatory approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of our product candidates. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. 
 Cost of Product Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue includes the cost of inventory sold, which includes direct manufacturing and supply chain costs. Prior to FDA approval, all product purchased from such suppliers was included as a component of research and development expense, as we were unable to assert that the inventory had future economic benefit until YCANTH (VP-102) received FDA approval. We purchased and included in research and development expenses approximately 4.5 million of raw cantharidin and processed active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API. The raw cantharidin and processed API is sufficient to produce approximately 14 million finished drug product applicators to be used for commercially saleable product and other product candidates. In addition, we purchased other components and services related to YCANTH (VP-102) for commercially saleable product and included approximately 1.2 million in research and development expenses prior to FDA approval. As a result, cost of product revenue related to YCANTH (VP-102) will initially reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials over approximately the next six months as previously expensed inventory is utilized for commercial production and sold to customers. If we included those costs previously expensed as a component of cost of product revenue, our cost of product revenue for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been 0.4 million and 1.8 million, respectively. 
 Cost of Collaboration Revenue 
 The costs of collaboration revenue consists of payments for manufacturing supply to support development and testing services pursuant to the Torii Clinical Supply Agreement.

Product Revenue, Net 
 Product revenue, net was negative 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Negative revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in our returns reserve of 1.7 million for estimated returns from certain distributors. We determined it was more than probable that product held by certain distributors will be returned based on lower than forecasted sell-through and expiration of product. This increase in reserve was in addition to an adjustment of other gross to net reserves of 0.2 million mostly related to increase in co-pay reserve. We will continue to work with all of our distributors to sell through existing inventory and expand target channels of sales and distribution. Reserves will continue to be reviewed on a quarterly basis and may be adjusted based on assessment of the overall business and sales forecast by each distributor. There were no ex-factory sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to lower demand pull through. 
 YCANTH (VP-102), our first FDA approved product, became available for commercial sale in August 2023. Revenue generated during the three months ending September 30, 2023 relates to the delivery of YCANTH (VP-102) to FFF, our sole distributor during this period. 
 Collaboration Revenue 
 Collaboration revenue was 0.1 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, collaboration revenue consisted of supplies and development activity with Torii. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 16.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 4.1 million was primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation of 7.0 million due to restricted stock units vested on FDA approval in July 2023 and a decrease in advertising costs of 1.0 million partially offset by increased compensation, and benefits and travel due to ramp-up of sales force of 1.6 million, an increase in medical affairs costs in selling, general and administrative expenses of 0.7 million, severance of 0.4 million, increased legal costs of 0.4 million and loss on disposal of assets of 0.3 million. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 4.1 million was primarily related to decrease in VP-315 clinical trial costs of 2.5 million, a decrease of medical affairs costs in research and development expenses of 0.7 million, decrease of stock compensation of 0.6 million related to restricted stock units vested on FDA approval in July 2023 and a reduction of costs related to YCANTH (VP-102) pre-launch activity of 0.5 million partially offset by increased headcount related costs of 0.3 million.

The following table summarizes our research and development expense by product candidate or, for unallocated expenses, by type, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We did not incur any research and development expense for VP-103 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Unallocated expenses include compensation and other personnel related costs.

Cost of Product Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of obsolete inventory write-off of 0.3 million and 0.1 million of indirect overhead labor and product testing costs. YCANTH (VP-102), our first FDA approved product, became available for commercial sale in August 2023. Cost of product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.1 million related to indirect overhead labor costs. All product costs had previously been expensed prior to FDA approval of YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of molluscum. 
 Cost of Collaboration Revenue 
 Cost of collaboration revenue was 0.1 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The costs were related to manufacturing supply required to support development and testing services pursuant to the Torii Clinical Supply Agreement. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.6 million was primarily due to lower cash balance for the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The higher interest expense of 0.7 million was due to the OrbiMed Credit Agreement commencement on July 26, 2023.

Product Revenue, Net 
 Product revenue, net was 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. YCANTH (VP-102), our first FDA approved product, became available for commercial sale in August 2023. The increase of 3.5 million relates to additional sales of YCANTH (VP-102) to FFF, our primary distributor, related to forecasted demand pull through, as well as the expansion of our specialty distribution network during the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 to bring-on an additional specialty distributor and the related impact of an initial one-time stock-in order from that distributor. Revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by an increase in our returns reserve of 1.7 million for estimated returns from our distributors. We determined it was more than probable that product held by certain distributors will be returned based on our lower than forecasted sell-through and expiration of product. We will continue to work with all of our distributors to sell through existing inventory and expand target channels of sales and distribution. Reserves will continue to be reviewed on a quarterly basis and may be adjusted based on assessment of the overall business and sales forecast by each distributor. 
 Collaboration Revenue 
 Collaboration revenue was 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 which consisted of supplies and development activity with Torii for each period. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 48.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 30.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 18.6 million was primarily due to higher expenses related to commercial activities for YCANTH (VP-102), including increased compensation, recruiting fees, benefits and travel due to ramp-up of sales force of 13.8 million, increased marketing and sponsorship costs of 2.5 million, increase in other commercial activity of 3.3 million, increased legal costs of 1.3 million, severance costs of 0.5 million, Dormer legal settlement of 0.8 million, an increase in medical affairs costs of 0.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and increased finance costs of 0.6 million partially offset by decrease in stock compensation costs of 5.0 million due to restricted stock units vested on FDA approval in July 2023. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses were 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 4.3 million was primarily due to a reduction of costs related to YCANTH (VP-102) pre-launch activity of 3.2 million, a decrease in clinical trial costs for VP-315 of 0.9 million, a decrease in medical affairs costs in research and development of 0.7 million, and decrease of stock compensation of 0.6 million related to restricted stock units vested on FDA approval in July 2023 partially offset by increased headcount related costs of 1.1 million. 
 The following table summarizes our research and development expense by product candidate or, for unallocated expenses, by type for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We did not incur any research and development expense for VP-103

Cost of Product Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue was 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1.2 million was related to additional product sales and obsolete inventory write-off of 0.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cost of Collaboration Revenue 
 Cost of collaboration revenue was 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 0.5 million was primarily due to increased manufacturing supply required to support development and testing services pursuant to the Torii Clinical Supply Agreement. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 0.7 million was primarily due to lower cash as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The higher interest expense of 5.4 million was due to the OrbiMed Credit Agreement commencement on July 26, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have financed our operations since inception primarily through sales of our convertible preferred stock, the sale of our common stock, the issuance of debt and 20.0 million from the Torii Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 23.0 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. 
 On July 21, 2023, the FDA approved YCANTH (VP-102) topical solution for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in adult and pediatric patients two years of age and older. Our first commercial sale of YCANTH (VP-102) occurred in August 2023 to FFF, our primary specialty pharmacy distributor. 
 On July 26, 2023, we entered into the Credit Agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed 50.0 million on July 26, 2023, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 44.1 million after payment of certain fees and transaction related expenses. Amounts borrowed under the Loan Facility will mature on July 26, 2028. 
 Payments of the principal amount of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, together with a repayment premium and other fees, are not required under the Credit Agreement unless our net revenue attributable to YCANTH on a trailing 12-month basis does not equal or exceed specified amounts for specified test periods as set forth in the Credit Agreement beginning on December 31, 2024. If, on a test date, we do not achieve the specified amount of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, then, beginning on the last day of the next full month immediately following the such test date, we would be required to repay the outstanding principal amount of the loans on the last day of each month in equal monthly installments through the maturity date, together with the applicable repayment premium and the exit fee. If we do not achieve the specified amount of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis to meet the revenue test requirements as of December 31, 2024, we would begin making principal payments on the outstanding debt balance starting in January 2025. We do not anticipate meeting the revenue test as of December 31, 2024. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that we must maintain a liquidity of at least 10.0 million and if we are unable to maintain compliance by either amending the debt or raising additional funds, we could be in default in the near-term. The Credit Agreement also requires that our quarterly and annual financial statements not be subject to any qualification or statement which is of a going concern or 
 24 

similar nature. The qualification of a "going concern" was waived for the quarterly financial statements ended September 30, 2024. If the qualification of a "going concern" is not waived for additional future periods or if we don t raise additional financing, we may be in default of our debt in the near-term. Upon the occurrence of an event of default (subject to notice and grace periods), additional interest of 4 per annum applies and obligations under the Credit Agreement could be accelerated. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as amended. 
 During the term of the Loan Facility, interest payable in cash by us will accrue on any outstanding balance due under the Loan Facility at a rate per annum equal to the higher of (x) the SOFR rate (which is the forward-looking term rate for a one-month tenor based on the secured overnight financing rate administered by the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited) and (y) 4.00 plus, in either case, 8.00 . During an event of default, any outstanding amount under the Loan Facility will bear interest at a rate of 4.00 in excess of the otherwise applicable rate of interest. We will pay certain fees with respect to the Loan Facility, including an upfront fee, an unused fee on the undrawn portion of the Loan Facility, an administration fee, a prepayment premium and an exit fee, as well as certain other fees and expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities used 44.9 million of cash, primarily resulting from a net loss of 60.4 million partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation of 6.4 million, non-cash amortization and impairment of right-of-use assets of 0.9 and non-cash interest expense of 1.6 million. Net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 1.5 and a decrease in accounts payable of 1.5 million partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of 4.4 million and a net increase in accrued expenses of 4.9 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used 24.1 million of cash, primarily resulting from a net loss of 42.4 million partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation of 12.3 million. Net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a decrease in prepaid and other assets of 1.0 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 7.8 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 3.9 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in investing activities of 27,000 and 135,000, respectively, was for the purchase of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used by financing activities of 1.7 million was primarily due to 1.1 million of debt amendment costs related to the OrbiMed Credit Agreement and finance lease payments of 0.6 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities of 74.2 million was primarily related to net cash proceeds of 44.1 million from the OrbiMed Credit Agreement and proceeds of 30.3 million, net of issuance costs from the issuance of common stock and pre-funded warrants. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Our first commercial sale of YCANTH (VP-102) occurred in August 2023 to FFF, our primary specialty pharmacy distributor. While we expect to continue to generate revenue from the sale of YCANTH (VP-102), we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue commercialization of YCANTH (VP-102) and continue the research and development of, continue or initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. We expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We will need substantial additional financing to fund our operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to reduce operating expenses, delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs and/or continued and future commercialization efforts. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to support our planned operations only into the 
 25 

first quarter of 2025. These factors cause substantial doubt to exist about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financial statements are issued. The Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 our ability to maintain compliance with our covenants under our Credit Agreement; 

the level of sales achieved, and costs related to the commercialization of YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum; 

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

the scope, progress, results and costs of our clinical trials; 

the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our loan agreements; 

the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; 

the impact on the timing of our clinical trials and our business; 

the costs to scale up and secure manufacturing arrangements for commercial production of YCANTH (VP 102) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and any product candidate we successfully commercialize; and 

the costs of establishing and maintaining sales and marketing capabilities for YCANTH (VP 102) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and any product candidate that obtains regulatory approval. 

Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes many years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, YCANTH (VP-102), and our other product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues will be derived solely from sales of YCANTH (VP-102) in the near term. We may need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interests of existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our existing stockholders rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. 
 If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments as previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 26 

Item 3. 	 Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risks 
 There have been no material changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. 	 Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Principal Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Principal Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item. 1 Legal Pro ceedings 
 On June 6, 2022, plaintiff Kranthi Gorlamari Plaintiff filed a putative class action complaint captioned Gorlamari v. Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc., et al., in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors Defendants ). On January 12, 2023, the Plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging that Defendants violated federal securities laws by, among other things, failing to disclose certain manufacturing deficiencies at the facility where our contract manufacturer produced bulk solution for the YCANTH (VP-102) drug device and that such deficiencies posed a risk to the prospects for regulatory approval of YCANTH (VP-102) for the treatment of molluscum. The amended complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of Plaintiff and all other persons and entities which purchased or otherwise acquired our securities between May 19, 2021 and May 24, 2022 (the Putative Class Period ). 
 On January 12, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court held that Plaintiff s claims relating to statements made in May and June 2021 were sufficiently pled, but dismissed Plaintiff s claims relating to all other statements made during the Putative Class Period. On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint in an attempt to cure certain of the deficiencies identified in the January 12, 2024 ruling. Defendants motion to dismiss the second amended complaint was fully briefed as of April 22, 2024, and is pending before the Court. On September 3, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. The Court dismissed Plaintiff s claims related to one of the two individual defendants but held that Plaintiff s claims against us and the other individual defendant were sufficiently pled. 
 In addition, on October 21, 2024, plaintiff Ivan S. Cohen filed a putative stockholder derivative lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint names us as a nominal defendant and purports to bring claims on or against certain of our current and former directors and officers for alleged violations of the federal securities laws and breaches of their fiduciary duties in relation to substantially the same factual allegations as the above-described putative class action lawsuit. The complaint primarily seeks to recover for us compensatory damages for losses allegedly sustained related to the facts alleged, restitution, and punitive damages. 
 We are involved in ordinary, routine legal proceedings that are not considered by management to be material. We believe the ultimate liabilities resulting from such legal proceedings will not materially affect our financial position or our results of operations or cash flows.

Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 Our business is subject to risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. In addition to the other information set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in that report. 
 Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. 
 We have incurred recurring losses from operations since inception and we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to support our planned operations only into the first quarter of 2025. These factors cause substantial doubt to exist about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. In addition, if there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, we may be required to begin paying principal prior to the maturity date, and we believe we will be unable to borrow additional funds pursuant to our Loan Facility. 
 We have entered into a Credit Agreement with OrbiMed, pursuant to which we borrowed 50.0 million in July 2023. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by all or substantially all of our assets. 
 The Credit Agreement provided for up to 25.0 million could have been made available on or prior to June 30, 2024, up to 30.0 million would be made available on or prior to December 31, 2024, up to 10.0 million would be made available on or prior to March 31, 2025, and up to 10.0 million would be made available on or prior to June 30, 2025, in each case, subject to certain revenue requirements. We did not achieve the revenue target as of June 30, 2024 and were not able to borrow the first additional tranche of 25.0 million. In addition, we do not believe we will be able to borrow, and do not intend to borrow, additional tranches under the Credit Agreement. 
 We are subject to a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants pursuant to the Credit Agreement, which limit or restrict our ability to (subject to certain qualifications and exceptions): create liens and encumbrances; incur additional indebtedness; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions, investments, advances or loans; dispose of or transfer assets; pay dividends or make other payments in respect of their capital stock; amend certain material documents; redeem or repurchase certain debt; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into certain restrictive agreements. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that the Company must maintain a liquidity of at least 10.0 million and that the Company s quarterly and annual financial statements not be subject to any qualification or statement which is of a going concern or similar nature beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default (subject to notice and grace periods). We are currently in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants. 
 Payments of the principal amount of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, together with a repayment premium and other fees, are not required under the Credit Agreement unless our net revenue attributable to YCANTH on a trailing 12-month basis does not equal or exceed specified amounts for specified test periods as set forth in the Credit Agreement beginning on December 31, 2024. If, on a test date, we do not achieve the specified amount of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, then, beginning on the last day of the next full month immediately following the such test date, we would be required to repay the outstanding principal amount of the loans on the last day of each month in equal monthly installments through the maturity date, together with the applicable repayment premium and the exit fee. 
 If we are unable to achieve certain milestones, generate sufficient revenue and raise additional capital through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and license and collaboration agreements, we will no longer be in compliance with these covenants. We may also enter into other debt agreements in the future which may contain similar or more restrictive terms. 
 Our ability to make scheduled monthly payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including the amount of our cash reserves and our actual and projected financial and operating performance. These amounts and our performance are subject to certain financial and business factors, as well as prevailing economic and competitive conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash balances or cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our existing or future indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, or that these actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Failure to comply with the conditions of the Credit Agreement could result in an event of default, which could result in an acceleration 
 28 

of amounts due under the Credit Agreement. We may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness or to make any accelerated payments, and OrbiMed could seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness, which would harm our business. 
 
 Greater than expected returns of YCANTH (VP-102) may exceed our reserve for returns, which would adversely affect our revenue and operating results. 
 The pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors to which we sell YCANTH (VP-102) are permitted to return purchased product under certain circumstances. We estimate expected returns based on our review of similar products in the industry and record discrete reserves if product held by distributors, forecasted sales and expiration of product warrant a reserve. Substantially all returns are due to expiry of the product. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we increased our returns reserve by 1.7 million on previously sold product as a result of lower than forecasted sell-through and expiration of product. Any significant increase in returns that exceeds our reserve could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 Appointment of Interim Principal Financial Officer and Interim Principal Accounting Officer 
 
 On November 1, 2024, our Board of Directors designated Ted White, our President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, as the Company s interim principal financial officer and interim principal accounting officer, effective immediately, to serve until November 5, 2024.

EXHIBIT 10.2 Execution Version 

Release Agreement 
 This Release Agreement Release or Agreement is made by and between Joseph Bonaccorso you and Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the Company ). 
 1. Separation. The Company and you agree and acknowledge that you have provided notice to the Company of your resignation from employment with the Company effective August 30, 2024. As such, your last day of work with the Company and your employment termination date will be August 30, 2024 (the Separation Date ). 

2. Severance Payments; Other Payments 

a. In consideration for your execution, return and non-revocation of this Release within the timeframe provided herein, the Company will provide you with the following Severance Benefits : 

i. The Company will make severance payments to you in the form of continuation of your base salary in effect on the Separation Date for the equivalent of twelve (12) months following the Separation Date, less applicable withholdings and deductions (the Severance Payment ). These payments will be made on the Company s ordinary payroll dates, commencing on the Company s first regular payroll date that is more than thirty (30) days following the Separation Date (the Severance Pay Commencement Date ), provided the Company has received the executed Agreement from you on or before that date and that the Agreement is no longer subject to revocation. On the Severance Pay Commencement Date, the Company will pay in a lump sum the aggregate amount of the Severance Payment under this Section 2(a)(i) that the Company would have paid you through such date had the payments commenced immediately following the Separation Date through the Severance Pay Commencement Date, with the balance paid thereafter on the applicable schedule described above. 

ii. If you timely elect continued coverage under COBRA for yourself and your covered dependents under the Company s group health plans following the Separation Date, then the Company shall pay the COBRA premiums necessary to continue you and your covered dependents health insurance coverage in effect for yourself (and your covered dependents) on the Separation Date until the earliest of (x) twelve (12) months following the Separation Date; (y) the date when you become eligible for health insurance coverage in connection with new employment or self-employment; or (iii) the date you cease to be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage for any reason, including plan termination (such period from the Separation Date through the earlier of (i)-(iii), the COBRA Payment Period ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Company determines that its payment of COBRA premiums on your behalf would result in a violation of applicable law (including but not limited to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the 2010 Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), then in lieu of paying COBRA premiums pursuant to this Section, the Company shall pay you on the last day of each remaining month of the COBRA Payment Period, a fully taxable cash payment equal to the COBRA premium for such month, subject to applicable tax withholding (such amount, the Special 

1 

CONFIDENTIAL EXECUTION COPY 

 Severance Payment ), such Special Severance Payment to be made without regard to your payment of COBRA premiums and without regard to the expiration of the COBRA period prior to the end of the COBRA Payment Period. You may, but are not obligated, to use the Special Severance Payment to pay for medical expenses. Nothing in this Agreement shall deprive you of your rights under COBRA or ERISA for benefits under plans and policies arising under your employment by the Company. 

b. In addition, regardless of whether you sign this Agreement, the Company affirms that it will pay your accrued but unpaid salary through the Separation Date on the next regularly scheduled date on which payroll is run after the Separation Date. 

3. Consulting Opportunity. In addition to the Severance Benefits set forth above, if you timely execute and return this Agreement, do not revoke it, and fully comply with your obligations under this Agreement and the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement between you and the Company dated January 10, 2020 (the Employment Agreement ), the Company will, effective immediately upon the Separation Date, retain you as a nonemployee consultant to perform such services as set forth in the Consulting Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Consulting Agreement ), pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth therein. You must sign and return the Consulting Agreement no later than the date you execute and return this Agreement to the Company. 

4. Compliance with Section 409A. The Severance Benefits offered to you by the Company are payable in reliance on Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) and the short term deferral exemption in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4). For purposes of Code Section 409A, your right to receive any installment payments (whether pay in lieu of notice, Severance Benefits, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. All payments and benefits are subject to applicable withholdings and deductions. 

5. Equity Awards. You were previously granted options to purchase certain shares of the Company s common stock (the Options ), pursuant to the Company s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan or the Company s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan and together with the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, the Plans ). You were also granted restricted stock units to be issued shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the 2018 Plan (the RSUs and together with the Options, the Equity Awards ). Under the terms of the Plans and your applicable Option and/or RSU agreements (together with the Plans, the Equity Award Documents ), vesting of the Options and RSUs will cease as of the date your Continuous Service (as defined in the Plans, as applicable) ends. Provided that you shall have timely executed the Consulting Agreement and satisfied the conditions for receipt of the Severance Benefits (as described in Section 2 above), your Continuous Service will be deemed to have continued following the Separation Date, and your unvested Equity Awards will remain eligible to vest through the duration of the Consulting Agreement. 

6. Release. In exchange for the Severance Benefits and other consideration, including but not limited to the Consulting Agreement, to which you would not otherwise be
