CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly
Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
which are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections. 

We may, in some cases, use words such as anticipate, 
 believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, 
 potential, predict, project, should, will, would or
the negative of these terms, and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes to identify these forward-looking
statements. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements
and are based upon our current expectations, beliefs, estimates and projections, and various assumptions, many of which, by their nature,
are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Such statements, include, but are not limited to, statements contained in this Quarterly
Report relating to our business, business strategy, products and services we may offer in the future, the timing and results of our clinical
trials, our capital outlook, successful completion of our clinical trials, our ability to raise additional capital, our ability to maintain
our Nasdaq listing, U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approval of our products candidates, our ability to comply with
changing government regulations, patent protection of our proprietary technology, product liability exposure, uncertainty of market acceptance,
competition, technological change, and other risk factors detailed herein and in other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC ). Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business,
the economy and other future conditions. Because forward looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties,
risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by
the forward-looking statements. They are neither statement of historical fact nor guarantees of assurance of future performance. We therefore
caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, a decline in general economic conditions nationally and
internationally, the ability to protect our intellectual property rights, competition from other providers and products, risks in product
development, inability to raise capital on favorable terms (or at all) to fund continuing operations, changes in Nasdaq rules, changes
in government regulation, and other factors (including the risks contained in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under
the heading Risk Factors relating to our industry, our operations and results of operations and any businesses that may
be acquired by us. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned. 

Factors or events that could cause our actual
results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them, nor can we assess the impact of
all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required
by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to and do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results.

Additionally, in vitro, the Hemopurifier
has been demonstrated to capture H5N1 bird flu virus, H1N1 swine flu virus, Zika virus, Lassa virus, MERS-CoV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr
virus, Herpes simplex virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, smallpox-related viruses, and the reconstructed Spanish
flu virus of 1918. In several cases, these studies were conducted in collaboration with leading government or non-government research
institutes. 

On June 17, 2020, the FDA approved a supplement
to our open Investigational Device Exemption IDE for the Hemopurifier in viral disease to allow for the testing of the
Hemopurifier in patients with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, or COVID-19, in a new feasibility study. In June 2022, the first patient in this
study was enrolled and completed the Hemopurifier treatment phase of the protocol. Due to the lack of COVID-19 patients in the ICUs of
our trial sites, we terminated this study in 2022. However, our IDE for this indication remains open, as we have an active COVID-19 trial
in India and wish to preserve the option of enrolling patients if the situation with COVID-19 changes. 

Under Single Patient Emergency Use regulations,
Aethlon has treated two patients with COVID-19 with the Hemopurifier, in addition to the COVID-19 patient treated with our Hemopurifier
in our COVID-19 clinical trial discussed above. 

We also obtained ethics review board ERB approval from and entered into a clinical trial agreement with Medanta Medicity Hospital, a multi-specialty hospital in Delhi NCR, India,
for a COVID-19 clinical trial at that location. In May 2023, we received ERB approval from the Medanta Medicity Hospital and Maulana Azad
Medical College MAMC ), for a second site for our clinical trial in India to treat severe COVID-19. MAMC was established
in 1958 and is located in New Delhi, India. MAMC is affiliated with the University of Delhi and is operated by the Delhi government. 

We now have two sites in India for this trial
with the MAMC. One patient has been treated to date; however, we have been informed by our CRO that a new COVID-19 subvariant was detected
in India recently. Our COVID-19 trial in India remains open in the event that there are COVID-19 admissions to the ICUs at our sites in
India. 

Additionally, based on preclinical data with acellular
kidney perfusates, we believe that the Hemopurifier has potential applications in organ transplantation. We are investigating whether
the Hemopurifier, when incorporated into a machine perfusion organ preservation circuit, can remove harmful viruses, exosomes, RNA molecules,
cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory molecules from recovered organs. We initially are focused on recovered kidneys from deceased
donors. We have previously demonstrated the removal of multiple viruses and exosomes and exosomal particles from buffer solutions, in
vitro , utilizing a scaled-down version of our Hemopurifier and believe this process could reduce transplantation complications by
improving graft function, reducing graft rejection, maintaining or improving organ viability prior to transplantation, and potentially
reducing the number of kidneys rejected for transplant. 

Successful outcomes of
human trials will also be required by the regulatory agencies of certain foreign countries where we plan to market and sell the Hemopurifier.
Some of our patents may expire before FDA approval or approval in a foreign country, if any, is obtained. However, we believe that certain
patent applications and/or other patents issued to us more recently will help protect the proprietary nature of our Hemopurifier treatment
technology. 

In addition to the foregoing, we are monitoring
closely the impact of inflation, the war between Russia and Ukraine and the military conflicts in Israel and the surrounding areas, as
well as related political and economic responses and counter-responses by various global factors on our business. Given the level of uncertainty
regarding the duration and impact of these events on capital markets and the U.S. economy, we are unable to assess the impact on our timelines
and future access to capital. The full extent to which inflation, the ongoing military conflicts and other global instability will impact
our business, results of operations, financial condition, clinical trials and preclinical research will depend on future developments,
as well as the economic impact on national and international markets that are highly uncertain. 

We incorporated in Nevada on March 10, 1999. Our
executive offices are located at 11555 Sorrento Valley Road, Suite 203, San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is (619) 941-0360.
Our website address is www.aethlonmedical.com. 

Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol
 AEMD. 

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

During the six months ended September 30, 2024,
there were no changes to our significant accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2024. 

reverse
stock split of our then outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, each 10 shares of outstanding common stock then held by our stockholders
were combined into one share of common stock. Any fractional shares resulting from the reverse split were rounded up to the next whole
share. Authorized common stock remained at shares following the stock split. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes have been retroactively revised to reflect such reverse stock split as if it had occurred
on April 1, 2023. All shares and per share amounts have been revised accordingly. 

. These factors, among other matters,
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date these financial statements are issued.
A significant amount of additional capital will be necessary to advance the development of our products to the point at which they may
become commercially viable. We intend to fund operations, working capital and other cash requirements for the twelve-month period subsequent
to September 30, 2024 through a combination of debt and/or equity financing arrangements and potentially from collaborations or strategic
partnerships. 

The successful outcome of future activities cannot
be determined at this time and there is no assurance that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute our intended business
plan or generate positive operating results. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to this uncertainty and as to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or
the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management expects that existing cash as of September
30, 2024 will not be sufficient to fund the Company s operations for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these condensed
consolidated financial statements. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. 

in favor of our landlord. The L/Cs are in lieu of a security deposit. In order to support the L/Cs,
we agreed to have our bank withdraw 87,506 from our operating accounts and to place that amount in a restricted certificate of deposit.
We have classified that amount as restricted cash, a long-term asset, on our balance sheet. 

and potential common shares, respectively, consisting of shares underlying outstanding stock options, warrants,
and restricted stock units were excluded, as their inclusion would be antidilutive. 

Six months ended 

shares of our common stock and accompanying Class A warrants to purchase up to 
shares of common stock and Class B warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock, at a combined public offering price of
 0.58 per share and accompanying warrants; and (ii) in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common
stock and accompanying Class A warrants to purchase up to 5,650,000 shares of common stock and Class B warrants to purchase up to 5,650,000
shares of common stock, at a combined public offering price of 0.579 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrants, which is equal
to the public offering price per share of common stock, and accompanying warrants less the 0.001 per share exercise price of each such
pre-funded warrant. 

All pre-funded warrants issued in the offering
were exercised in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Class A and Class B warrants each have an
exercise price of per share, are immediately exercisable, and, in the case of Class A warrants, will expire on , and
in the case of Class B warrants, will expire on . The exercise price of the Class A and Class B warrants is also subject to
adjustment for stock splits, reverse splits, and similar capital transactions as described in such warrants. 

Maxim Group LLC Maxim ),
served as the exclusive placement agent in connection with the offering. We paid Maxim a cash fee of 6.5 of the aggregate gross proceeds
raised at the closing of the offering, and reimbursement of certain expenses and legal fees in the amount of . We also issued
to designees of Maxim warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock (the Placement Agent Warrants ).
The Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price of per share and have substantially the same terms as the Class A warrants,
except the Placement Agent Warrants are not subject to an exercise price reset, are non-exercisable until November 15, 2024, and will
expire on . 

The gross proceeds from
the offering, before deducting the placement agent s fees and other offering expenses, were approximately million . Net proceeds,
of the offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and expenses and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately 
million . 

The shares of common
stock, the Class A and Class B warrants, the pre-funded warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants described above and the underlying shares
of common stock were offered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-278188), which was declared effective
by the SEC on May 15, 2024.

of Class A and Class B warrants exercised shares and shares, respectively, for additional proceeds to the Company of

Restricted Stock Unit Grants 

On April 16, 2024, our Board of Directors approved,
pursuant to the terms of the Director Compensation Policy, the grant of the annual RSUs under the Director Compensation Policy to each
of the four non-employee directors of the Company then serving on the Board of Directors. The Director Compensation Policy provides for
a grant of stock options or 50,000 worth of RSUs at the beginning of each fiscal year for current non-employee directors then serving
on the Board of Directors, and for a grant of stock options or 75,000 worth of RSUs for a newly elected non-employee director, with each
RSU priced at the average of the closing prices for the five trading days preceding and including the date of grant, or 1.52 per share
for the RSUs granted in April 2024. As a result, in April 2024, the four eligible directors were each granted RSUs under the Company s
2020 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2020 Plan ).

into a Separation Agreement, effective October 3, 2024, with a former employee we accrued for salary and related expenses associated
with the Separation Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, we accrued in health insurance
costs in the same period. We paid out and in separation expenses

Total Stock-Based Compensation 

We review share-based compensation on a quarterly
basis for changes to the estimate of expected award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture experience. The cumulative effect of adjusting
the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. The effect of forfeiture
adjustments for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was insignificant. 

On September 30, 2024, our outstanding stock options
had no intrinsic value since the closing price on that date of per share was below the weighted average exercise price of our outstanding

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The following discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the condensed consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report ). Some of the
information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect
to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For a complete discussion
of forward-looking statements, see the section above entitled Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements. 

Overview 

Aethlon Medical, Inc. Aethlon ,
the Company, we or us is a medical therapeutic company focused on developing the Hemopurifier,
a clinical-stage immunotherapeutic device designed to combat cancer and life-threatening viral infections and for use in organ transplantation.
In human studies, 164 sessions with 38 patients, the Hemopurifier was safely utilized and demonstrated the potential to remove life-threatening
viruses. In pre-clinical studies, the Hemopurifier has demonstrated the potential to remove harmful exosomes and exosomal particles from
biological fluids, utilizing its proprietary lectin-based technology. This action has potential applications in cancer, where exosomes
and exosomal particles may promote immune suppression and metastasis, and in life-threatening infectious diseases. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration FDA has designated the Hemopurifier as a Breakthrough Device for two independent indications: 

the treatment of individuals with advanced or metastatic cancer who are either unresponsive to or intolerant of standard of care therapy,
and with cancer types in which exosomes or exosomal particles have been shown to participate in the development or severity of the disease;
and 

the treatment of life-threatening
viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies. 

We believe the Hemopurifier may be a substantial
advancement in the treatment of patients with advanced and metastatic cancer through its design to bind to and remove harmful exosomes
and exosomal particles that promote the growth and spread of tumors. In October 2022, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Australia
to initially conduct oncology-related clinical research, then seek regulatory approval and commercialize our Hemopurifier in Australia. 

We have recently launched in Australia and in
India safety, feasibility and dose-finding clinical trials of the Hemopurifier in cancer patients with solid tumors who have stable or
progressive disease during anti-PD-1 monotherapy treatment, such as Keytruda (pembrolizumab) or Opdivo (nivolumab). The primary
endpoint of the approximately nine to 18-patient, safety, feasibility and dose-finding trial in each country is the incidence of adverse
events and clinically significant changes in safety lab tests of Hemopurifier treated patients with solid tumors with stable or progressive
disease at different treatment intervals, after a two-month run in period of PD-1 antibody, Keytruda or Opdivo monotherapy.
Patients who do not respond to the therapy will be eligible to enter the Hemopurifier period of the study where sequential cohorts will
receive 1, 2 or 3 Hemopurifier treatments during a one-week period. In addition to monitoring safety, the study is designed to examine
the number of Hemopurifier treatments needed to decrease the concentration of extracellular vesicles EVs and whether these
changes in EV concentrations improve the body's own natural ability to attack tumor cells. These exploratory central laboratory analyses
are expected to inform the design of a subsequent efficacy and safety, Premarket Approval (PMA), study required by regulatory agencies. 

The following two hospitals in Australia have
received ethics committee approval, have gone through training on our device and are now open for patient enrollment: Royal Adelaide Hospital
in Adelaide, Australia and Pindara Private Hospital in the Gold Coast section of Australia. We have also trained a third hospital in Australia,
but we have not yet received ethics committee approval for that institution and have not yet begun patient enrollment. In November 2024,
we received confirmation that the first two patients enrolled at the Royal Adelaide Hospital location have successfully completed screening
and are advancing to the run-in period of the trial. The enrollment of the first two eligible patients marks a significant milestone in
advancing our clinical program for the Hemopurifier. 

We have received ethics committee approval from
Medanta Medicity Hospital in Gurugram, India for a similar nine to 18-patient, safety, feasibility and dose-finding trial. We are completing
the necessary logistical steps before they can open for patient enrollment. 

18 

We have entered into an agreement with North American
Science Associates, LLC NAMSA ), a world leading medical technology contract research organization CRO offering
global end-to-end development services, to oversee our clinical trials of the Hemopurifier for patients in Australia with various types
of cancer tumors. We also have engaged Qualtran LLC as the CRO for our clinical trial in India. 

We also believe that the Hemopurifier can be part
of the broad-spectrum treatment of life-threatening highly glycosylated, or carbohydrate coated, viruses that are not addressed with an
already approved treatment. In small-scale or early feasibility human studies, the Hemopurifier has been used in the past to treat individuals
infected with human immunodeficiency virus HIV ), hepatitis-C and Ebola. 

Additionally, in vitro, the Hemopurifier has been
demonstrated to capture H5N1 bird flu virus, H1N1 swine flu virus, Zika virus, Lassa virus, MERS-CoV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus,
Herpes simplex virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, smallpox-related viruses, and the reconstructed Spanish flu virus
of 1918. In several cases, these studies were conducted in collaboration with leading government or non-government research institutes. 

On June 17, 2020, the FDA approved a supplement
to our open Investigational Device Exemption IDE ), for the Hemopurifier in viral disease to allow for the testing of the
Hemopurifier in patients with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, or COVID-19, in a new feasibility study. In June 2022, the first patient in this study
was enrolled and completed the Hemopurifier treatment phase of the protocol. Due to the lack of COVID-19 patients in the ICUs of our trial
sites, we terminated this study in 2022. However, our IDE for this indication remains open, as we have an active COVID-19 trial in India
and wish to preserve the option of enrolling patients if the situation with COVID-19 changes. 

Under Single Patient Emergency Use regulations,
Aethlon has treated two patients with COVID-19 with the Hemopurifier, in addition to the COVID-19 patient treated with our Hemopurifier
in our COVID-19 clinical trial discussed above. 

We also obtained ethics review board ERB approval from and entered into a clinical trial agreement with Medanta Medicity Hospital, a multi-specialty
hospital in Delhi NCR, India, for a COVID-19 clinical trial at that location. In May 2023, we received ERB approval from the Medanta
Medicity Hospital and Maulana Azad Medical College MAMC ), for a second site for our clinical trial in India to treat
severe COVID-19. MAMC was established in 1958 and is located in New Delhi, India. MAMC is affiliated with the University of Delhi
and is operated by the Delhi government. 

We now have two sites in India for this trial
with the MAMC. One patient has been treated to date; however, we have been informed by our CRO that a new COVID-19 subvariant was detected
in India recently. Our COVID-19 trial in India remains open in the event that there are COVID-19 admissions to the ICUs at our sites in
India. 

Additionally, based on preclinical data with acellular
kidney perfusates, we believe that the Hemopurifier has potential applications in organ transplantation. We are investigating whether
the Hemopurifier, when incorporated into a machine perfusion organ preservation circuit, can remove harmful viruses, exosomes, RNA molecules,
cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory molecules from recovered organs. We initially are focused on recovered kidneys from deceased
donors. We have previously demonstrated the removal of multiple viruses and exosomes and exosomal particles from buffer solutions, in
vitro, utilizing a scaled-down version of our Hemopurifier and believe this process could reduce transplantation complications by improving
graft function, reducing graft rejection, maintaining or improving organ viability prior to transplantation, and potentially reducing
the number of kidneys rejected for transplant. 

Successful outcomes of human trials will also
be required by the regulatory agencies of certain foreign countries where we plan to market and sell the Hemopurifier. Some of our patents
may expire before FDA approval or approval in a foreign country, if any, is obtained. However, we believe that certain patent applications
and/or other patents issued to us more recently will help protect the proprietary nature of our Hemopurifier treatment technology. 

In addition to the foregoing, we are monitoring
closely the impact of inflation, the war between Russia and Ukraine and the military conflicts in Israel and the surrounding areas, as
well as related political and economic responses and counter-responses by various global factors on our business. Given the level of uncertainty
regarding the duration and impact of these events on capital markets and the U.S. economy, we are unable to assess the impact on our timelines
and future access to capital. The full extent to which inflation, ongoing military conflicts and other global instability will impact
our business, results of operations, financial condition, clinical trials and preclinical research will depend on future developments,
as well as the economic impact on national and international markets that are highly uncertain.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS
ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

Operating Expenses 

Consolidated operating expenses for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,902,119, compared to 3,175,346 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of
 273,227, or 8.6 , in the 2024 period was due to a decrease of 562,266 in professional fees, partially offset by an increase of 181,473
in payroll and related expenses and a 107,567 increase in general and administrative expenses. 

In the three months ended September 30, 2024,
professional fees decreased by 562,266, primarily due to a 270,071 reduction in legal fees following a transition to a new legal firm,
a 211,417 decrease in contract labor expenses due to project completions with contract manufacturing organizations and research and development
consultants, an 80,630 decrease in accounting fees, and a 62,500 reduction in recruiting fees. These decreases were partially offset
by an increase in investor relations expenses to support the dissemination of progress on ongoing clinical trials. 

Payroll expenses rose by 181,473, largely
due to an increase of 507,307 in separation expenses related to severance agreements following the termination of an executive and
a reduction in workforce. This increase was partially offset by a 172,419 reduction in ongoing payroll expenses and a 143,688
decrease in stock-based compensation as a result of completion of vesting of some existing stock options and expiration of options
associated with reduced headcount. 

The 107,567 increase in general and
administrative expenses was primarily driven by a 162,790 increase in clinical trial expenses associated with our ongoing oncology clinical trial. A decrease of 32,551 in supplies following the completion of certain research and development efforts, a
 10,361 decrease in conference and trade show expenses, and a 9,671 decrease in insurance costs. 

Net Loss 

As a result of the changes in expenses noted above,
our comprehensive loss decreased to 2,803,169 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3,036,891 in the three months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Basic and diluted loss attributable to common
stockholders was 0.20) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.22) for the three-month period ended September
30, 2023. 

20 

SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED
SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 

Operating Expenses 

Consolidated operating expenses for the six months
ended September 30, 2024 were 5,521,856, compared to 6,583,506 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of 1,061,651,
or 16.1 , in the 2024 period was due to decreases in our professional fees of 924,822 and general and administrative expenses of 449,864.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 313,035 in payroll and related expenses. 

The 924,822 decrease in professional fees was
mainly due to a 430,205 reduction in contract labor costs related to completed projects with a contract manufacturing organization, as
well as with outside research and development and regulatory and quality management consultants. Additional decreases included 343,656
in legal fees following a transition to a new legal firm, a 62,500 reduction in recruiting fees, a 48,784 decline in consulting fees
incurred by our Australian subsidiary, and a 32,622 decrease in accounting fees for activities conducted in the prior year with no similar
expenses in the current year. 

The 449,864 decrease in general and administrative
expenses was primarily driven by a 479,994 reduction in supplies expenses for raw materials purchased last year for the research, development,
and manufacturing of our Hemopurifier. Other decreases included a 44,137 decrease in cleanroom repair and maintenance expenses, a 27,763 decline in conference, tradeshow,
and travel and entertainment expenses, and a 20,897 decrease in insurance costs. These decreases were partially offset by a 141,928
increase in expenses primarily related to our ongoing oncology clinical trial. 

The 313,035 increase in payroll expenses was
primarily due to 827,910 in severance-related salary expenses for two executives and a reduction in workforce. This increase was partially
offset by a 260,401 reduction in ongoing payroll expenses and a 254,474 decrease in stock-based compensation due to reduced headcount. 

 . 

 Net Loss 

As a result of the changes in expenses noted above, our comprehensive
loss decreased from 6,320,064 in the six months ended September 30, 2023, to 5,375,443 in the six months ended September 30, 2024. 

Basic and diluted loss attributable to common
stockholders was 0.50) for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.57) for the six-month period ended September 30,
2023. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance
of 6,859,075 and working capital of 4,806,633. This compares to a cash balance of 5,441,978 and working capital of 4,395,889 at March
31, 2024. 

On May 17, 2024, we closed a public offering of
our equity, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of: (i) 2,450,000 shares of our common stock and accompanying Class A warrants to purchase
up to 2,450,000 shares of common stock and Class B warrants to purchase up to 2,450,000 shares of common stock, at a combined public offering
price of 0.58 per share and accompanying warrants; and (ii) in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 5,650,000 shares
of common stock and accompanying Class A warrants to purchase up to 5,650,000 shares of common stock and Class B warrants to purchase
up to 5,650,000 shares of common stock, at a combined public offering price of 0.579 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrants,
which is equal to the public offering price per share of common stock and accompanying warrants, less the 0.001 per share exercise price
of each such pre-funded warrant. The gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting the placement agent s fees and other offering
expenses, were approximately 4.7 million. Net proceeds, of the offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and expenses and other
offering expenses payable by us, were approximately 3.5 million. In June 2024, holders of Class A and Class B warrants exercised 300,000
shares and 2,880,000 shares, respectively, for additional total proceeds of 1,844,400. See the section entitled May 2024 Public
Offering, below, for additional information regarding this offering. 

21 

We do not expect our existing cash as of September
30, 2024 to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements. Significant
additional financing must be obtained to provide a sufficient source of operating capital and to allow us to continue to operate as a
going concern. We intend to fund operations, working capital and other cash requirements for the twelve-month period subsequent
to September 30, 2024 through a combination of debt and/or equity financing arrangements and potentially from collaborations or strategic
partnerships. 

As we expand our activities, our overhead costs
to support personnel, laboratory materials and infrastructure will increase and significant additional financing must be obtained to provide
a sufficient source of operating capital. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable to us on
reasonable terms, if at all, when we require it, we may be unable to support our research and our planned clinical trials. The failure
to implement our research and clinical trials would have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct planned clinical trials and
commercialize our products. 

Future capital requirements will depend upon many
factors, including progress with pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, the number and breadth of our clinical programs, the time and
costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, the time and costs
involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, competing technological and market developments, as well as our ability to establish collaborative
arrangements, effective commercialization, marketing activities and other arrangements. We expect to continue to incur increasing negative
cash flows and net losses for the foreseeable future. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates,
among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. We have incurred continuing
losses from operations and at September 30, 2024 had limited working capital and an accumulated deficit of 159,945,141. These factors,
among other matters, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of the financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report. A significant amount of additional capital will be necessary to advance the development
of our products to the point at which they may become commercially viable. We intend to fund operations, working capital and other cash
requirements for the twelve-month period subsequent to September 30, 2024 through a combination of debt and/or equity financing arrangements
and potentially from collaborations or strategic partnerships. 

The successful outcome
of future activities cannot be determined at this time and there is no assurance that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute
our intended business plan or generate positive operating results. 

The condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to this uncertainty and as to the recoverability and classification of asset
carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

May 2024 Public Offering 

On May 17, 2024, we closed a public offering pursuant
to which we sold an aggregate of: (i) 2,450,000 shares of our common stock and accompanying Class A warrants to purchase up to 2,450,000
shares of common stock and Class B warrants to purchase up to 2,450,000 shares of common stock, at a combined public offering price of
 0.58 per share and accompanying warrants; and (ii) in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 5,650,000 shares of common
stock and accompanying Class A warrants to purchase up to 5,650,000 shares of common stock and Class B warrants to purchase up to 5,650,000
shares of common stock, at a combined public offering price of 0.579 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrants, which is equal
to the public offering price per share of common stock and accompanying warrants, less the 0.001 per share exercise price of each such
pre-funded warrant. 

22 

All pre-funded warrants issued in the offering
were exercised in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Class A and Class B warrants each have an
exercise price of 0.58 per share, are immediately exercisable, and, in the case of Class A warrants, will expire on May 17, 2029, and
in the case of Class B warrants, will expire on May 19, 2025. The exercise price of the Class A and Class B warrants is also subject to
adjustment for stock splits, reverse splits, and similar capital transactions as described in such warrants. 

Maxim Group LLC Maxim ),
served as the exclusive placement agent in connection with the offering. We paid Maxim a cash fee of 6.5 of the aggregate gross proceeds
raised at the closing of the offering, and reimbursement of certain expenses and legal fees in the amount of 100,000. We also issued
to designees of Maxim warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 324,000 shares of common stock (the Placement Agent Warrants ).
The Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price of 0.58 per share and have substantially the same terms as the Class A warrants,
except the Placement Agent Warrants are not subject to an exercise price reset, are non-exercisable until November 15, 2024, and will
expire on May 15, 2029. 

The gross proceeds from
the offering, before deducting the placement agent s fees and other offering expenses, were approximately 4.7 million. Net
proceeds, of the offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and expenses and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately
 3.5 million. 

The shares of common
stock, the Class A and Class B warrants, the pre-funded warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants described above and the underlying shares
of common stock were offered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-278188), which was declared effective
by the SEC on May 15, 2024. 

Warrant Exercises 

In June 2024, and holders of Class A and Class
B warrants exercised 300,000 shares and 2,880,000 shares, respectively, for additional proceeds to the Company of 1,844,400.

NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES. We used
cash in our operating activities due to our losses from operations. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately 3,962,000
in the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 5,187,000 in the six months ended September 30, 2023. The primary
components in the 1,225,000 decrease in cash used in our operating activities in the 2024 period was a decrease in our net loss of approximately
 938,000 and a positive net change in other working capital components of 555,000, partially offset by the reduction of 268,000 in non-cash
components. 

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. We did
not use cash for investing activities in the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 237,000 in the six months
ended September 30, 2023. The 237,000 decrease in the 2024 period was primarily a result of equipment purchase for our laboratory incurred
in the six months ended September 2023. 

NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES. During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, we raised approximately 5,384,000, net of placement agent fees and offering costs, from the
sale and issuance of our common stock and warrants in connection with a public offering and the exercise of 300,000 and 2,880,000 Class
A and Class B warrants, respectively, by holders thereof. The source of cash from our financing activities was partially offset by the
use of approximately 9,000 to pay for the tax withholding upon settlement of on restricted stock units, for a net aggregate amount of
cash provided by financing activities of approximately 5,375,000. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2023,
we raised approximately 1,086,000 from the issuance of our common stock under our at the market facility. That source of cash from our
financing activities was partially offset by the use of approximately 16,000 to pay for the tax withholding on restricted stock units,
for a net aggregate amount of cash provided by financing activities of approximately 1,068,000. 

Material Cash Requirements 

We expect our clinical trial expenses for
our oncology trials in Australia and India to increase for the foreseeable future. Those increases in clinical trial expenses include
the cost of manufacturing additional Hemopurifiers. 

In addition, we are obligated under lease agreements
for our headquarters, laboratory and manufacturing facilities. We expect our rent payments to continue to increase for the foreseeable
future. 

Future capital requirements will depend upon many
factors, including progress with pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, the number and breadth of our clinical programs, the time and
costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other proprietary rights, the time and costs
involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, competing technological and market developments, as well as our ability to establish collaborative
arrangements, effective commercialization, marketing activities and other arrangements. We expect to continue to incur increasing negative
cash flows and net losses for the foreseeable future. We will continue to need to raise additional capital either through equity and/or
debt financing for the foreseeable future. 

We plan to access the equity markets for additional
capital, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access such additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. 

Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely
impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the
United States, including due to actual or perceived changes in interest rates and economic inflation, and worldwide resulting from macroeconomic
factors. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we cannot predict the timing or amount of
increased expenses and we may never be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Management s discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations is based on our interim condensed consolidated financial statements, that we prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). Preparing these financial statements
requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses, and related
disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
We believe our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts our results of operations for all
periods. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 

We believe that the estimates and assumptions
that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most difficult,
subjective or complex judgments, form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to us. These critical accounting
estimates relate to long lived assets, stock compensation, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, contingencies and clinical trial accruals. 

There have been no changes to our critical accounting
policies and estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined by
Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures 
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed,
in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer (who is our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. 

Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, we
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 

Based on such evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As previously reported in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related
to segregation of duties within our financial systems. Specifically, user access controls were not sufficiently maintained to properly
restrict both user and privileged access to financial applications within our accounting software system to initiate, record and approve
entries. Also noted that check stock was secured in an authorized signatory s office. 

25 

Since identifying the material weakness, we have
been actively engaged in implementing measures to remediate the weakness and enhance our internal control over financial reporting. These
measures include but are not limited to updating the accounting software and creating distinct user roles. Transactions are recorded by
personnel who are independent of those who initiate them and are approved by separate personnel who are independent of those who record
them. Additionally, check stock had been relocated in November 2023. 

We believe that these
measures, once fully implemented and operational for a sufficient period of time, will effectively remediate the material weakness. We
are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these controls and
procedures. 

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Other than the changes to remediate the material
weakness noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ending September 30, 2024
that have materially affected, or reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

26 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, claims are made against us
in the ordinary course of business, which could result in litigation. Claims and associated litigation are subject to inherent uncertainties
and unfavorable outcomes could occur, such as monetary damages, fines, penalties or injunctions prohibiting us from selling one or more
products or engaging in other activities. 

The occurrence of an unfavorable outcome in any
specific period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period or future periods. We are not presently
a party to any pending or threatened legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

RISK FACTOR SUMMARY 

Below is a summary of the principal factors that
make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion
of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found under the heading Risk Factors 
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on June 27, 2024, and should be carefully
considered, together with other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC before making investment
decisions regarding our securities. 

We have incurred significant losses and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. 

We will require additional financing to sustain our operations, achieve our business objectives and satisfy our cash obligations, which may dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders. 

We have limited experience in identifying and working with large-scale contracts with medical device manufacturers; manufacture of our devices must comply with good manufacturing practices in the United States. 

Delays, interruptions or the cessation of production by our third-party suppliers of important materials or delays in qualifying new materials, has and may continue to prevent or delay our ability to manufacture our Hemopurifier. 

We face intense competition in the medical device industry. 

Our Hemopurifier technology may become obsolete. 

If we fail to comply with extensive regulations of U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies, the commercialization of our products could be delayed or prevented entirely. 

If we are unable to regain compliance with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares. 

27 

As a public company with limited financial resources
 undertaking the launch of new medical technologies, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining executive management and directors. 

We plan to expand our operations, which may strain
 our resources; our inability to manage our growth could delay or derail implementation of our business objectives. 

Our success is dependent in part on our executive
 officers. 

We have not received, and may never receive, approval
 from the FDA to market a medical device in the United States. Even though we have received breakthrough device designation for the Hemopurifier
 for two independent indications, this designation may not expedite the development or review of the Hemopurifier and does not provide
 assurance ultimately of PMA submission or approval by the FDA. 

Delays in successfully commencing or completing our planned clinical trials could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval and sustain our operations. 

There have been no material changes to the risk
factors previously disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report. The risks described in our Annual Report
are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be
immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

We did not issue or sell any unregistered securities during the three
months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES. 

None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION. 

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
none of our directors or officers entered into, or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule
10b5-1 trading arrangement, that were intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1, in each case as defined
in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
