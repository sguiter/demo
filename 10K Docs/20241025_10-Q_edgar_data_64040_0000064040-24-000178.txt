Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of S P Global Inc. 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of S P Global Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and equity for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated interim financial statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes and schedules (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 8, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 
 Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of contracts for work that has not yet been performed. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was billion. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately percent and percent of the remaining performance obligations over the next and months, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter. 
 
 We do not disclose the value of unfulfilled performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts where revenue is a usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. 
 
 Costs to Obtain Contracts 
 
 We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that the costs associated with certain sales commission programs are incremental to the costs to obtain contracts with customers and therefore meet the criteria to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain contracts were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The capitalized asset will be amortized over a period consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, calculated based on the customer term and the average life of the products and services underlying the contracts which has been determined to be approximately years. The expense is recorded within selling and general expenses. 
 
 We expense sales commissions when incurred if the benefit of those costs is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling and general expenses.

The contingent payment was payable following the closing upon the achievement of certain conditions related to the transition of LCD customer relationships. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the contingent payment resulted in a pre-tax gain of million million after-tax) related to the sale of LCD in our Market Intelligence segment and million million after-tax) in (Gain) loss on dispositions, net related to the sale of a family of leveraged loan indices in our Indices segment.

 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The lower rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a combination of discrete adjustments and change in the profit mix. The higher rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the tax charge on divestitures. 
 
 At the end of each interim period, we estimate the annual effective tax rate and apply that rate to our ordinary quarterly earnings. The tax expense or benefit related to significant unusual or infrequently occurring items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect, and are individually computed, is recognized in the interim period in which

million and million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately million in the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of local tax examinations. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15 . This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.

billion. The changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in prepaid and other current assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

 Net Investment Hedges 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. As of December 31, 2023, we held cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in one of our European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. These swaps are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and are scheduled to mature in 2024, 2029, 2030 and 2032. The notional value of our outstanding cross currency swaps designated as a net investment hedge was billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The changes in the fair value of these swaps are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of other comprehensive income (loss), and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold, liquidated or substantially liquidated. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges based on changes in spot exchange rates. Accordingly, amounts related to the cross currency swaps recognized directly in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 represent net periodic interest settlements and accruals, which are recognized in interest expense, net. We recognized net interest income of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and net interest income of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Indian rupee, British pound, and Euro exposures through the third quarter of 2026 and the fourth quarter of 2025, respectively. These contracts are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future revenue and operating costs and are scheduled to mature within . The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into revenue and selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that million of pre-tax gain related to foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was million and million, respectively. 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 
 In the first quarter of 2023, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of million and received net proceeds of million upon termination. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were scheduled to mature beginning in the first quarter of 2027. We performed a final effectiveness test upon the termination of each swap, and the effective portion of the gain of million was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our

Net periodic benefit cost related to our postretirement plans reflected in the table above was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 As discussed in our Form 10-K, we changed certain discount rate assumptions for our retirement and postretirement plans which became effective on January 1, 2024. The effect of the assumption changes on retirement and postretirement expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 did not have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we contributed million to our retirement plans and expect to make additional required contributions of approximately million to our retirement plans during the remainder of the year. We may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance or any potential deterioration of our pension plan status in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Stock Repurchases 
 
 On June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of million shares (the 2022 Repurchase Program ), which was approximately of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. 
 
 Our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of September 30, 2024, million shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program. Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. 
 
 We enter into accelerated share repurchase ASR agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement.

transactions: a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The shares delivered under the ASR agreements resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The repurchased shares are held in Treasury. The forward stock purchase contracts are classified as equity instruments.

 Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses. 
 Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations.

 Legal and Regulatory Matters 
 
 In the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often subjected to government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. 
 
 A class action lawsuit was filed in Australia on August 7, 2020 against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company. A separate lawsuit was filed against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company in Australia on February 2, 2021 by entities within the Basis Capital investment group. The lawsuits both relate to alleged investment losses in collateralized debt obligations rated by Ratings prior to the financial crisis. We can provide no assurance that we will not be obligated to pay significant amounts in order to resolve these matters on terms deemed acceptable. 
 
 From time to time, the Company receives customer complaints. The Company believes it has strong contractual protections in the terms and conditions included in its arrangements with customers. Nonetheless, in the interest of managing customer relationships, the Company from time to time engages in dialogue with such customers in an effort to resolve such complaints, and if such complaints cannot be resolved through dialogue, may face litigation regarding such complaints. The Company does not expect to incur material losses as a result of these matters. 
 
 Moreover, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities, antitrust matters and other matters, such as ESG. For example, as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO") registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Exchange Act, S P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. On September 3, 2024, as part of an industry-wide investigation into off-channel communications by the SEC, S P Global Ratings, and certain other NRSROs, reached a settlement to resolve violations of recordkeeping rules. This matter was previously disclosed by S P Global. In the SEC s 
 28 

million. S P Global previously accrued that amount in its consolidated financial statements for the second quarter of 2024. Although S P Global seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC or another regulator raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulator will not seek remedies against S P Global for one or more compliance deficiencies. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. 
 
 In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity (if any) restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that such outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.

 Revenue increased 16 driven by increases at all of our reportable segments. The increase at Ratings was driven by growth in both transaction revenue and non-transaction revenue. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth in corporate bond ratings revenue and bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased issuance volumes due to higher refinancing activity. Non-transaction revenue increased due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a cumulative catch-up for customers unreported commercial paper issuance in the third quarter of 2023. The increase at Market Intelligence was primarily due to subscription revenue growth for work flow solutions at Enterprise Solutions, data feed products within Data and Advisory Solutions, RatingsXpress , RatingsDirect and Credit Analytics within Credit Risk Solutions and Market Intelligence Desktop products. Revenue growth at Commodity Insights was primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products. The increase at Indices was primarily due to higher asset-linked fees revenue, higher data subscription revenue and higher exchange-traded derivative revenue. The increase at Mobility was primarily due to new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes within the Financial business. Revenue at Market Intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024 and unfavorably impacted by the sale of Fincentric in August of 2024. Revenue at Commodity Insights was favorably impacted by the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2023 of 7 percentage points, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2023 of 5 percentage points and the impact of a gain on disposition in 2024 of 4 percentage points, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2024 of 2 percentage points and a statutorily required bonus accrual adjustment in 2024 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 20 . The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by increased incentives as a result of financial performance, higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and investments in strategic initiatives, and higher technology costs.

 Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by re-calculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business s functional currency. 
 
 Other Loss (Income), net 
 
 Other loss (income), net includes gains and losses on our mark-to-market investments and the net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and post retirement plans. Other loss, net was 2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other income, net of 5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher losses on our mark-to-market investments in 2024 compared to 2023. Other income, net increased to 10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher losses on our mark-to-market investments in 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense, net 
 
 Interest expense, net decreased 12 million or 14 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 31 million or 12 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher interest income from invested cash due to a more favorable interest rate environment combined with a benefit from our net investment hedge program. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 23.0 and 21.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 18.2 and 21.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The lower rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a combination of discrete adjustments and change in the profit mix. The higher rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the tax charge on divestitures. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15 . This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.

Ratings 
 
 Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default. 
 
 Ratings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with: 
 ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and 
 bank loan ratings. 
 Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue was 41 million and 120 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 38 million and 113 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Three Months 
 
 Revenue increased 36 , with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point.

An increase in structured finance revenue driven by increased collateralized loan obligations CLOs issuance also contributed to transaction revenue growth. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance revenue and an increase in new entity credit ratings revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a cumulative catch-up for customers unreported commercial paper issuance in the third quarter of 2023. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories. 
 
 Operating profit increased 47 . Excluding the impact of a statutorily required bonus accrual adjustment in 2024 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 48 due to revenue growth.

Billed Issuance Volumes 
 
 We monitor billed issuance volumes regularly within Ratings. Billed issuance excludes items that do not impact transaction revenue, such as issuance from frequent issuer programs, unrated debt, and most international public finance to more effectively correlate issuance activity to movements in transaction revenue. 
 
 The following table provides billed issuance levels based on Ratings internal data feeds for the periods ended September 30: 
 Three Months Nine Months (in billions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Investment-grade billed issuance 
 395 211 88 1,242 877 42 High-yield billed issuance

 Note - Totals presented may not sum due to rounding. 
 Includes Corporates, Financial Services and Infrastructure. 
 Includes Bank Loans, Structured Finance and Government. 
 
 Third quarter billed issuance was up as continued favorable market conditions drove issuers to capitalize on tightening borrowing spreads. Refinancing continued to drive high-yield, while M A and other non-refinancing activity drove billed issuance increases in investment grade and bank loans. Structured finance billed issuance increases were driven primarily by new CLO issuance.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses. Cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure. 
 
 Cash Flow Overview 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were 1,697 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 406 million from December 31, 2023. 
 
 The following table provides cash flow information for the nine months ended September 30: 
 (in millions) 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 3,949 2,376 66 Investing activities (262) 607 N/M Financing activities (3,280) (2,602) 26 
 N/M Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100 or not meaningful 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, free cash flow increased 1,575 million to 3,645 million compared to 2,070 million in the first nine months of 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities as discussed 
 52 

below. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, net. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow. 
 
 Operating activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased 1,573 million to 3,949 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase is mainly due to higher operating results, higher cash collections and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in 2024. 
 
 Investing activities 
 
 Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions. 
 
 Cash used for investing activities was 262 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 607 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher cash proceeds received in 2023 related to the disposition of Engineering Solutions. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
 
 Financing activities 
 
 Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and repayments of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily attributable to the borrowing of short-term and long-term debt. 
 
 Cash used for financing activities increased 678 million to 3,280 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to proceeds received from the 750 million issuance of senior note in 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased a total of 3.8 million shares for 2 billion of cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we purchased a total of 5.4 million shares for 2 billion of cash. See Note 8 Equity to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further discussion. 
 
 Additional Financing 
 
 We have the ability to borrow a total of 2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our 2.0 billion 5-year credit agreement (our credit facility that will terminate on April 26, 2026. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had no commercial paper outstanding. 
 
 Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 8 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurr ence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility. 
 
 T he only financial covenant required is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 On January 23, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of 0.91 per share.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, net. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow. 
 
 We believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, net are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock. 
 
 The presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30: 
 
 (in millions) 2024 2023 Change Cash provided by operating activities 3,949 2,376 66 Capital expenditures (91) (95) Distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, net (213) (211) Free cash flow 3,645 2,070 76

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in our most recent Form 10-K. As discussed in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in our most recent Form 10-K, we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. These critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable non-controlling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Since the date of our most recent Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates.

 58 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These forward contracts are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries against volatility in foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2023, we held positions in a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuation s in interest rates. We have not en tered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 5 - Derivative Instruments to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q for further discussion. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed so that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Interim Chief Financial Officer Interim CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the CEO and Interim CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and Interim CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 For a discussion of our risk factors please see Item 1A, Risk Factors in our most recent Form 10-K. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 On June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the 2022 Repurchase Program ), which was approximately 9 of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. During the third quarter of 2024, we received 2.6 million shares from our accelerated share repurchase ASR agreement that we entered into on July 31, 2024. Further discussion relating to our ASR agreements can be found in Note 8 - Equity . As of September 30, 2024, 14.6 million shares remained under the 2022 Repurchase Program.
