 programs: the Portfolio Program and the Purchase Program. Under the Portfolio Program, we advance money to Dealers (referred to as a Dealer Loan in exchange for the right to service the underlying Consumer Loans. Under the Purchase Program, we buy the Consumer Loans from the Dealers (referred to as a Purchased Loan and keep all amounts collected from the consumer. Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans are collectively referred to as Loans.

 Portfolio Program 
 
 As payment for the vehicle, the Dealer generally receives the following: 
 a down payment from the consumer; 
 a non-recourse cash payment advance from us; and 
 after the advance balance (cash advance and related Dealer Loan fees and costs) has been recovered by us, the cash from payments made on the Consumer Loan, net of certain collection costs and our servicing fee Dealer Holdback ). 
 
 We record the amount advanced to the Dealer as a Dealer Loan, which is classified within Loans receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash advanced to the Dealer is automatically assigned to the Dealer s open pool of advances. Dealers make an election as to how many Consumer Loans (either or will be assigned to an open pool before it is closed, and subsequent advances are assigned to a new pool. Unless we receive a request from the Dealer to keep a pool open, we automatically close each pool based on the Dealer s election. All advances within a Dealer s pool are secured by the future collections on the related Consumer Loans assigned to the pool. For Dealers with more than one pool, the pools are cross-collateralized so the performance of other pools is considered in determining eligibility for Dealer Holdback. We perfect our security interest with respect to the Dealer Loans by obtaining control or taking possession of the Consumer Loans, which list us as lien holder on the vehicle title. 
 
 The Dealer servicing agreement provides that collections received by us during a calendar month on Consumer Loans assigned by a Dealer are applied on a pool-by-pool basis as follows: 
 first, to reimburse us for certain collection costs; 
 second, to pay us our servicing fee, which generally equals of collections; 
 third, to reduce the aggregate advance balance and to pay any other amounts due from the Dealer to us; and 
 fourth, to the Dealer as payment of Dealer Holdback. 
 
 If the collections on Consumer Loans from a Dealer s pool are not sufficient to repay the advance balance and any other amounts due to us, the Dealer will not receive Dealer Holdback. Certain events may also result in Dealers forfeiting their rights to Dealer Holdback, including becoming inactive before assigning Consumer Loans. 
 
 Dealers have an opportunity to receive an accelerated Dealer Holdback payment each time a pool of Consumer Loans is closed. The amount paid to the Dealer is calculated using a formula that considers the number of Consumer Loans assigned to the pool and the related forecasted collections and advance balance.

 Seasonality 
 
 Our business is seasonal with peak Consumer Loan assignments and collections occurring during the first quarter of the year. This seasonality has a material impact on our interim results, as we are required to recognize a significant provision for credit losses expense at the time of assignment.

 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we applied an adjustment to our methodology for forecasting the amount of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio, which reduced the forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024. Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 had continued to underperform our expectations for several quarters. More recently, Consumer Loans assigned in 2023 had also begun exhibiting similar trends of underperformance, although not as severe as Consumer Loans assigned in 2022. During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience to estimate the magnitude by which we expected Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 would likely underperform our historical collection rates on Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. Accordingly, we applied an adjustment to Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 to reduce forecasted collection rates to what we believed the ultimate collection rates would be based on these trends. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of this forecast adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 reduced forecasted net cash flows by million, or , and increased provision for credit losses by million. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2023, we adjusted our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent Consumer Loan performance and Consumer Loan prepayment data. We had experienced a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments to below-average levels and as a result, slowed our forecasted net cash flow timing. Historically, Consumer Loan prepayments have been lower in periods with less availability of consumer credit. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of the adjustment to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2023 reduced forecasted net cash flows by million, or , and increased provision for credit losses by million.

 As the vast majority of our team members now work remotely, we had significant excess space in the two office buildings that we owned in Southfield, Michigan. During the second quarter of 2024, we sold the larger building for net sales proceeds of million, and recognized a loss on sale of the building of million. The loss on sale of the building represented the amount by which the million carrying value of the building and its improvements, the related land and land improvements, and office furniture and equipment exceeded the net sales proceeds of million.

 million revolving secured line of credit facility, to which we refer as our revolving secured line of credit facility, with a commercial bank syndicate and (2) an uncommitted 20.0 million revolving secured line of credit facility, to which we refer as the RTP facility, with a lender for use solely in facilitating payments by the Company through the lender s real-time payments service. 
 
 Borrowings under our revolving secured line of credit facility, including any letters of credit issued under the facility, are subject to a borrowing-base limitation. This limitation equals of the value of Loans, as defined in the agreement governing our revolving secured line of credit facility, less a hedging reserve (not exceeding million), and the amount of other debt secured by the collateral that secures our revolving secured line of credit facility. Borrowings under our revolving secured line of credit facility are secured by a lien on most of our assets that do not secure obligations under our Warehouse facilities or Term ABS financings. 
 
 Borrowings under the RTP facility are secured by a lien on the same collateral that secures obligations under our revolving secured line of credit facility. The RTP facility terminates automatically if the lender ceases to be part of the commercial bank syndicate under our revolving secured line of credit facility or if its lending commitments under our revolving secured line of credit facility are terminated. 
 
 Warehouse Facilities 
 
 We have Warehouse facilities with total borrowing capacity of million. Each of the facilities is with a different lender or group of lenders. Under each Warehouse facility, we can convey Loans to the applicable wholly owned subsidiary in return for cash and/or an increase in the value of our equity in such subsidiary. In turn, each such subsidiary pledges the Loans as collateral to secure financing that will fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Loans. The financing provided to each such subsidiary under the applicable facility is generally limited to the lesser of of the outstanding balance of the conveyed Loans, as determined in accordance with the applicable agreement, plus certain restricted cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral, or the facility limit. 
 
 The financings create indebtedness for which the subsidiaries are liable and which is secured by all the assets of each subsidiary. Such indebtedness is non-recourse to us (other than customary, limited recourse to us in the form of repurchase obligations or indemnification obligations for any violations by us of our representations or obligations as seller, servicer, or custodian), even though we are consolidated for financial reporting purposes with the subsidiaries. Because the subsidiaries are organized as bankruptcy-remote legal entities separate from us, their assets (including the conveyed Loans) are not available to any creditors other than the creditors of the applicable subsidiary. 
 
 The subsidiaries pay us a monthly servicing fee equal to either or , depending upon the facility, of the collections received with respect to the conveyed Loans. The servicing fee is paid out of the collections. Except for the servicing fee and holdback payments due to Dealers, if a facility is amortizing, we do not have any rights in any portion of such collections until all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest, fees, and other related costs have been paid in full. If a facility is in its revolving period, the applicable subsidiary is entitled to the portion of such collections available after the payment of interest and transaction expenses under the facility, provided that the borrowing base requirements of the facility are satisfied. 
 
 Term ABS Financings 
 
 We have wholly owned subsidiaries (the Funding LLCs that have completed secured financing transactions with qualified institutional investors or lenders. In connection with each of these transactions, we conveyed Loans on an arms-length basis to a Funding LLC for cash and the sole membership interest in that Funding LLC. In turn, each Funding LLC, other than the Funding LLCs for the Term ABS 2019-2, 2021-1, 2022-2, and 2023-A financings, conveyed the Loans to the respective trusts that issued notes to qualified institutional investors. The Funding LLCs for the Term ABS 2019-2, 2021-1, 2022-2, and 2023-A financings pledged the Loans for the benefit of their respective lenders. The Term ABS 2021-3, 2021-4, 2023-1, 2023-2, 2023-3, 2023-A, 2023-5, 2024-A, 2024-1, 2024-2, and 2024-3 financings each consist of three classes of notes (or, in the case of the Term ABS 2023-A, three classes of loans), while the Term ABS 2022-1 and Term ABS 2022-3 financings consist of four classes of notes.

 or , depending upon the financing, of the collections received with respect to the conveyed Loans. The fee is paid out of the collections. Except for the servicing fee and Dealer Holdback payments due to Dealers, if a Term ABS financing is amortizing, we do not have any rights in any portion of such collections until all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest, fees, and other related costs have been paid in full. If a Term ABS financing is in its revolving period, the applicable trust or Funding LLC is entitled to the portion of such collections available after application of any amounts necessary to acquire additional Loans from us and to pay accrued interest on the debt and any other transaction expenses, provided that any necessary principal payments are made to compensate for certain reductions in the balance of eligible loans or, in the case of the Term ABS 2019-2 financing and Term ABS financings occurring after the Term ABS 2021-3 financing, certain reductions in forecasted collections. In addition, in our capacity as servicer of the Loans, we have a limited right to exercise a clean-up call option to purchase Loans from the Funding LLCs and/or the trusts under certain specified circumstances. For those Funding LLCs with a trust, when the trust s indebtedness is paid in full, either through collections or through a prepayment of the indebtedness, the trust is to pay any remaining collections over to its Funding LLC as the sole beneficiary of the trust. For all Funding LLCs, after the indebtedness is paid in full, any remaining collections will ultimately be available to be distributed to us as the sole member of the respective Funding LLC. 

million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2028 (the 2028 senior notes ). The 2028 senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of December 19, 2023, among the Company, as issuer, the Company s subsidiaries Buyers Vehicle Protection Plan, Inc. and Vehicle Remarketing Services, Inc., as guarantors (collectively, the Guarantors ), and the trustee under the indenture. 
 
 The 2028 senior notes mature on December 15, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of per annum, computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months and payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2024. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 senior notes to repurchase or redeem all of the million outstanding principal amount of our senior notes due 2024 (the 2024 senior notes ), of which million was repurchased on December 19, 2023 and the remaining million was redeemed on December 31, 2023. We used the remaining net proceeds from the 2028 senior notes for general corporate purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of million related to the repurchase and redemption of the 2024 senior notes. 
 
 On March 7, 2019, we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 senior notes ). The 2026 senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 7, 2019, among the Company, as issuer, the Guarantors, and the trustee under the indenture. 
 
 The 2026 senior notes mature on and bear interest at a rate of per annum, computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months and payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2019. We used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 senior notes for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding borrowings under our revolving secured line of credit facility. 
 
 The 2028 senior notes and 2026 senior notes (the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors, which are also guarantors of obligations under our revolving secured line of credit facility. Other existing and future subsidiaries of ours may become guarantors of the senior notes in the future. The indentures for the senior notes provide for a guarantor of the senior notes to be released from its obligations under its guarantee of the senior notes under specified circumstances. 
 
 Mortgage Note 
 
 We had a million mortgage note with a commercial bank that was secured by a first mortgage lien on a building acquired by us and an assignment of all leases, rents, revenues, and profits under all present and future leases of the building. The note was paid off in full during the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the sale of the related building. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our covenants under our revolving secured line of credit facility and our Warehouse facilities, including those that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and other financial conditions. These covenants require a minimum ratio of (1) our net earnings, adjusted for specified items, before income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and fixed charges to (2) our fixed charges, as defined in the agreements. These covenants also limit the maximum ratio of our funded debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to tangible net worth. Some of these covenants may indirectly limit the repurchase of common stock or payment of dividends on common stock. Our Warehouse facilities also contain covenants that measure the performance of the conveyed assets. 
 
 Our Term ABS financings also contain covenants that measure the performance of the conveyed assets. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our covenants under our Term ABS financings, the senior notes indentures, and the RTP facility.

 State and local income taxes Non-deductible executive compensation expense Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation - - Other Effective income tax rate 
 
 State and local income taxes 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the impact of state and local income taxes on our effective income tax rate decreased from the same period in 2023, primarily due to the settlement of an uncertain tax position during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the impact of state and local income taxes on our effective income tax rate increased from the same period in 2023, primarily due to: 
 An adjustment to an uncertain tax position estimate during the second quarter of 2024, which increased our effective income tax rate by 230 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in state tax laws that were enacted during the second quarter of 2024, which are expected to increase our long-term effective tax rate by approximately 10 basis points. The enactment of these tax law changes increased our effective income tax rate by 70 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Non-deductible executive compensation expense 
 
 We recognize non-deductible executive compensation expense as an increase of provision for income taxes or a reduction of benefit for income taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the impact of non-deductible executive compensation expense on our effective income tax rate increased from the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income. 
 
 Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation 
 
 We recognize an excess tax benefit or tax deficiency when the deduction for the stock-based compensation expense of a stock award for tax purposes differs from the cumulative stock-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. The excess tax benefit or tax deficiency is recognized in provision for income taxes in the period in which the amount of the deduction is determined, which is when restricted stock units are settled in common stock or stock options are exercised. Excess tax benefits reduce our effective income tax rate, while tax deficiencies increase our effective income tax rate. The decrease in the impact of excess tax benefits on our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of restricted stock units that were settled in common stock during the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the timing of long-term stock award grants, partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax income.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Part I - Item 1 - Financial Statements, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We make vehicle ownership possible by providing innovative financing solutions that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers regardless of their credit history. Our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing; from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers; and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our financing programs, but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated net income was 78.8 million, or 6.35 per diluted share, compared to consolidated net income of 70.8 million, or 5.43 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in finance charges, partially offset by an increase in interest expense. Our results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included: 
 
 A similar decline in forecasted collection rates 
 A decline in forecasted collection rates decreased forecasted net cash flows from our Loan portfolio by 62.8 million, or 0.6 , compared to a decrease in forecasted collection rates during the third quarter of 2023 that decreased forecasted net cash flows from our Loan portfolio by 69.4 million, or 0.7 . 
 A decrease in forecasted profitability for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 through 2024 
 Forecasted profitability was lower than our estimates at September 30, 2023, due to both a decline in forecasted collection rates and slower forecasted net cash flow timing since the third quarter of 2023. The slower forecasted net cash flow timing was primarily a result of a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments, which remain at below-average levels. 
 Growth in Consumer Loan assignment volume and the average balance of our Loan portfolio 
 Unit and dollar volumes grew 17.7 and 12.2 , respectively, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The average balance of our Loan portfolio, which is our largest-ever, increased 14.9 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 An increase in the initial spread on Consumer Loan assignments 
 The initial spread increased to 21.9 compared to 21.4 on Consumer Loans assigned in the third quarter of 2023. 
 An increase in our average cost of debt 
 Our average cost of debt increased from 5.8 to 7.3 , primarily a result of higher interest rates on recently completed or extended secured financings and recently issued senior notes and the repayment of older secured financings and senior notes with lower interest rates. 
 A decrease in common shares outstanding due to stock repurchases 
 Since the third quarter of 2023, we have repurchased approximately 566,000 shares, or 4.5 of the shares outstanding as of September 30, 2023. There were no stock repurchases during the third quarter of 2024.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated net income was 96.0 million, or 7.68 per diluted share, compared to consolidated net income of 192.5 million, or 14.73 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to increases in interest expense and provision for credit losses on forecast changes, partially offset by an increase in finance charges. Our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included: 
 
 A larger decline in forecasted collection rates 
 The decline in forecasted collection rates decreased forecasted net cash flows from our Loan portfolio by 282.9 million, or 2.8 , compared to a decrease in forecasted collection rates during the first nine months of 2023 that decreased forecasted net cash flows from our Loan portfolio by 149.3 million, or 1.7 . The 282.9 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows for the first nine months of 2024 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of 135.7 million, or 1.4 , and an adjustment applied to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2024, which upon implementation, reduced forecasted net cash flows by 147.2 million, or 1.4 . The 149.3 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows for the first nine months of 2023 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of 104.8 million, or 1.2 , and an adjustment to our forecasting methodology, which upon implementation, reduced forecasted net cash flows by 44.5 million, or 0.5 . 
 A decrease in forecasted profitability for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 through 2024 as described above 
 Growth in Consumer Loan assignment volume and the average balance of our Loan portfolio 
 Unit and dollar volumes grew 21.0 and 16.3 , respectively, as compared to the first nine months of 2023. The average balance of our Loan portfolio, which is our largest-ever, increased 13.5 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 An increase in the initial spread on Consumer Loan assignments 
 The initial spread increased to 22.0 compared to 21.2 on Consumer Loans assigned in the first nine months of 2023. 
 An increase in our average cost of debt 
 Our average cost of debt increased from 5.3 to 7.2 , primarily due to the factors described above. 
 A decrease in common shares outstanding due to stock repurchases as described above 
 Loss on sale of building 
 We recognized a 23.7 million loss during the second quarter of 2024 related to the sale of one of our two office buildings. The building was sold to reduce excess office space and eliminate the associated annual operating costs of approximately 2.1 million. 
 
 Critical Success Factors 
 
 Critical success factors include our ability to accurately forecast Consumer Loan performance, access capital on acceptable terms, and maintain or grow Consumer Loan volume at the level and on the terms that we anticipate, with the objective to maximize economic profit over the long term. Economic profit is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our financial results and determine profit-sharing for team members. We also use economic profit as a framework to evaluate business decisions and strategies. Economic profit measures how efficiently we utilize our total capital, both debt and equity, and is a function of the return on capital in excess of the cost of capital and the amount of capital invested in the business. 
 
 Consumer Loan Metrics 
 
 At the time a Consumer Loan is submitted to us for assignment, we forecast future expected cash flows from the Consumer Loan. Based on the amount and timing of these forecasts and expected expense levels, an advance or one-time purchase payment is made to the related Dealer at a price designed to maximize economic profit.

 We use a statistical model to estimate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan at the time of assignment. We continue to evaluate the expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan subsequent to assignment. Our evaluation becomes more accurate as the Consumer Loans age, as we use actual performance data in our forecast. By comparing our current expected collection rate for each Consumer Loan with the rate we projected at the time of assignment, we are able to assess the accuracy of our initial forecast. The following table compares our aggregated forecast of Consumer Loan collection rates as of September 30, 2024, with the aggregated forecasts as of June 30, 2024, as of December 31, 2023, and at the time of assignment, segmented by year of assignment:

 (1) Represents the total forecasted collections we expect to collect on the Consumer Loans as a percentage of the repayments that we were contractually owed on the Consumer Loans at the time of assignment. Contractual repayments include both principal and interest. Forecasted collection rates are negatively impacted by canceled Consumer Loans as the contractual amount owed is not removed from the denominator for purposes of computing forecasted collection rates. 
 (2) The forecasted collection rate for 2024 Consumer Loans as of September 30, 2024 includes both Consumer Loans that were in our portfolio as of June 30, 2024 and Consumer Loans assigned during the most recent quarter. The following table provides forecasted collection rates for each of these segments: 
 Forecasted Collection Percentage as of Current Forecast Variance from 2024 Consumer Loan Assignment Period September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Initial Forecast June 30, 2024 Initial Forecast January 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024 66.4 66.6 67.2 -0.2 -0.8 July 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 67.0 67.3 -0.3 
 
 Consumer Loans assigned in 2018 through 2020 have yielded forecasted collection results significantly better than our initial estimates, while Consumer Loans assigned in 2015, 2016, and 2021 through 2023 have yielded forecasted collection results significantly worse than our initial estimates. For all other assignment years presented, actual results have been close to our initial estimates. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, forecasted collection rates declined for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 through 2024 and were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for all other assignment years presented. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, forecasted collection rates improved for Consumer Loans assigned in 2019, declined for Consumer Loans assigned in 2021 through 2024, and were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for all other assignment years presented. 
 
 The changes in forecasted collection rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 impacted forecasted net cash flows (forecasted collections less forecasted Dealer Holdback payments) as follows: 
 
 (Dollars in millions) For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Decrease in Forecasted Net Cash Flows 2024 2023 2024 2023 Dealer loans (43.6) (40.3) (173.0) (89.3) Purchased loans (19.2) (29.1) (109.9) (60.0) Total (62.8) (69.4) (282.9) (149.3) change from forecast at beginning of period -0.6 -0.7 -2.8 -1.7

 During the second quarter of 2024, we applied an adjustment to our methodology for forecasting the amount of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio, which reduced the forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024. Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 had continued to underperform our expectations for several quarters. More recently, Consumer Loans assigned in 2023 had also begun exhibiting similar trends of underperformance, although not as severe as Consumer Loans assigned in 2022. During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience to estimate the magnitude by which we expected Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 would likely underperform our historical collection rates on Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. Accordingly, we applied an adjustment to Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 to reduce forecasted collection rates to what we believed the ultimate collection rates would be based on these trends. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of this forecast adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 reduced forecasted net cash flows by 147.2 million, or 1.4 , and increased provision for credit losses by 127.5 million. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2023, we adjusted our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent Consumer Loan performance and Consumer Loan prepayment data. We had experienced a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments to below-average levels and as a result, slowed our forecasted net cash flow timing. Historically, Consumer Loan prepayments have been lower in periods with less availability of consumer credit. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of the adjustment to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2023 reduced forecasted net cash flows by 44.5 million, or 0.5 , and increased provision for credit losses by 71.3 million. 
 
 We have experienced increased levels of uncertainty associated with our estimate of the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio since the beginning of 2020, with realized collections underperforming our expectations during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, outperforming our expectations following the distribution of federal stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, and underperforming our expectations during the current economic environment. For the period from January 1, 2020 through September 30, 2024, the cumulative change to our forecast of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio has been a decrease of 269.1 million, or 3.0 , as shown in the following table: 
 (Dollars in millions) Increase (Decrease) in Forecasted Net Cash Flows Three Months Ended Total Loans Change from Forecast at Beginning of Period March 31, 2020 (206.5) -2.3 June 30, 2020 24.4 0.3 September 30, 2020 138.5 1.5 December 31, 2020 (2.7) 0.0 March 31, 2021 107.4 1.1 June 30, 2021 104.5 1.1 September 30, 2021 82.3 0.9 December 31, 2021 31.9 0.3 March 31, 2022 110.2 1.2 June 30, 2022 (43.4) -0.5 September 30, 2022 (85.4) -0.9 December 31, 2022 (41.1) -0.5 March 31, 2023 9.4 0.1 June 30, 2023 (89.3) -0.9 September 30, 2023 (69.4) -0.7 December 31, 2023 (57.0) -0.6 March 31, 2024 (30.8) -0.3 June 30, 2024 (189.3) -1.7 September 30, 2024 (62.8) -0.6 Total (269.1) -3.0

 The profitability of our loans is primarily driven by the amount and timing of the net cash flows we receive from the spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate, less operating expenses and the cost of capital. Forecasting collection rates accurately at Loan inception is difficult. With this in mind, we establish advance rates that are intended to allow us to achieve acceptable levels of profitability across our portfolio, even if collection rates are less than we initially forecast. 
 
 The following table presents aggregate forecasted Consumer Loan collection rates, advance rates, and spreads (the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate), and the percentage of the forecasted collections that had been realized as of September 30, 2024, as well as forecasted collection rates and spreads at the time of assignment. All amounts, unless otherwise noted, are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the Consumer Loan (principal + interest). The table includes both Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans.

 (2) Presented as a percentage of total forecasted collections. 
 (3) The forecasted collection rate, advance rate and spread for 2024 Consumer Loans as of September 30, 2024 include both Consumer Loans that were in our portfolio as of June 30, 2024 and Consumer Loans assigned during the most recent quarter. The following table provides forecasted collection rates, advance rates, and spreads for each of these segments: 
 Forecasted Collection as of Spread as of 2024 Consumer Loan Assignment Period September 30, 2024 Initial Forecast Advance September 30, 2024 Initial Forecast January 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024 66.4 67.2 45.2 21.2 22.0 July 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 67.0 67.3 45.4 21.6 21.9 
 
 The risk of a material change in our forecasted collection rate declines as the Consumer Loans age. For 2020 and prior Consumer Loan assignments, the risk of a material forecast variance is modest, as we have currently realized in excess of 90 of the expected collections. Conversely, the forecasted collection rates for more recent Consumer Loan assignments are less certain as a significant portion of our forecast has not been realized. 
 
 The spread between the forecasted collection rate as of September 30, 2024 and the advance rate ranges from 13.2 to 23.7 , on an annual basis, for Consumer Loans assigned over the last 10 years. The spreads with respect to 2019 and 2020 Consumer Loans have been positively impacted by Consumer Loan performance, which has exceeded our initial estimates by a greater margin than the other years presented. The spread with respect to 2022 Consumer Loans has been negatively impacted by Consumer Loan performance, which has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than the other years presented. The higher spread for 2024 Consumer Loans relative to 2023 Consumer Loans as of September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of Consumer Loan performance, as the performance of 2023 Consumer Loans has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than 2024 Consumer Loans. Additionally, 2024 Consumer Loans had a higher initial spread, which was primarily due to a decrease in the advance rate. 
 
 The following table compares our forecast of aggregate Consumer Loan collection rates as of September 30, 2024 with the forecasts at the time of assignment, for Dealer Loans and Purchased Loans separately:

Payments of Dealer Holdback and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included. 
 
 Although the advance rate on Purchased Loans is higher as compared to the advance rate on Dealer Loans, Purchased Loans do not require us to pay Dealer Holdback. 
 
 The spread as of September 30, 2024 on 2024 Dealer Loans was 21.2 , as compared to a spread of 18.3 on 2023 Dealer Loans. The increase was due to Consumer Loan performance, as the performance of 2023 Dealer Loans has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than 2024 Dealer Loans. 
 
 The spread as of September 30, 2024 on 2024 Purchased Loans was 21.5 , as compared to a spread of 17.8 on 2023 Purchased Loans. The increase was primarily a result of a higher initial spread on 2024 Purchased Loans, due to a higher initial forecast and lower advance rate. Additionally, the performance of 2023 Purchased Loans has been lower than our initial estimates by a greater margin than 2024 Purchased Loans. 
 
 Access to Capital 
 
 Our strategy for accessing capital on acceptable terms needed to maintain and grow the business is to: (1) maintain consistent financial performance; (2) maintain modest financial leverage; and (3) maintain multiple funding sources. Our funded debt to equity ratio was 3.8 to 1 as of September 30, 2024. We currently utilize the following primary forms of debt financing: (1) our revolving secured line of credit facility; (2) Warehouse facilities; (3) Term ABS financings; and (4) senior notes.

 (1) Represents advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our Purchase Program. Payments of Dealer Holdback and accelerated Dealer Holdback are not included. 
 
 Consumer Loan assignment volumes depend on a number of factors including (1) the overall demand for our financing programs, (2) the amount of capital available to fund new Loans, and (3) our assessment of the volume that our infrastructure can support. Our pricing strategy is intended to maximize the amount of economic profit we generate, within the confines of capital and infrastructure constraints. 
 
 Unit and dollar volumes grew 17.7 and 12.2 , respectively, during the third quarter of 2024 as the number of active Dealers grew 8.8 and the average unit volume per active Dealer increased 8.4 . Dollar volume increased less than unit volume during the third quarter of 2024 due to a decrease in the average advance paid, due to decreases in the average size of Consumer Loans assigned and the average advance rate. Unit volume for the 28-day period ended October 28, 2024 grew 4.6 compared to the same period in 2023.

 Results of Operations 
 
 The net Loan income (finance charge revenue less provision for credit losses expense) that we recognize over the life of a Loan equals the cash we collect from the underlying Consumer Loan less the cash we pay to the Dealer. We believe the economics of our business are best exhibited by recognizing net Loan income on a level-yield basis over the life of the Loan based on expected future net cash flows. Under the GAAP methodology we employ, which is known as the current expected credit loss model, or CECL, we are required to recognize: 
 a significant provision for credit losses expense at the time of the Loan s assignment to us for contractual net cash flows we do not expect to realize; and 
 finance charge revenue in subsequent periods that is significantly in excess of our expected yield. 
 
 Due to the GAAP treatment of contractual net cash flows we do not expect to realize at the time of loan assignment (i.e. significant expense at the time of loan assignment, which is offset by higher revenue in subsequent periods), we do not believe the GAAP methodology we employ provides sufficient transparency into the economics of our business, including our results of operations, financial condition, and financial leverage. For additional information, see Note 3 and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I - Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.

 Finance Charges. The increase of 65.9 million, or 14.9 , was primarily due to an increase in the average net Loans receivable balance, as follows: 
 (Dollars in millions) For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Average net Loans receivable balance 7,690.9 6,690.8 1,000.1 Average yield on our Loan portfolio 26.4 26.4 0.0

 The increase in the average net Loans receivable balance was primarily due to the dollar volume of new Consumer Loan assignments exceeding the principal collected on Loans receivable. 
 
 Premiums Earned. The increase of 4.3 million, or 20.7 , was primarily due to growth in the size of our reinsurance portfolio, which resulted from growth in new Consumer Loan assignments and an increase in the average premium written per reinsured vehicle service contract in recent periods. 
 
 Operating Expenses. The increase of 18.9 million, or 17.1 , was primarily due to: 
 An increase in salaries and wages expense of 10.6 million, or 15.9 , primarily due to increases in (i) the number of team members as we are investing in our business with the goal of increasing the speed at which we enhance our product for Dealers and consumers and (ii) fringe benefits, primarily due to higher medical claims. 
 An increase in general and administrative expenses of 7.7 million, or 36.2 , primarily due to an increase in legal expenses. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses . Provision for credit losses remained relatively consistent, increasing by 0.1 million, or 0.1 . 
 
 We recognize provision for credit losses on new Consumer Loan assignments for contractual net cash flows that are not expected to be realized at the time of assignment. We also recognize provision for credit losses on forecast changes in the amount and timing of expected future net cash flows subsequent to assignment.

 Interest. The increase in interest expense of 40.7 million, or 57.7 , was due to: 
 An increase in our average cost of debt, which increased interest expense by 22.6 million, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on recently completed or extended secured financings and recently issued senior notes and the repayment of older secured financings and senior notes with lower interest rates. 
 An increase in our average outstanding debt balance, which increased interest expense by 18.1 million, primarily due to borrowings used to fund the growth of our Loan portfolio and stock repurchases.

 Provision for Income Taxes . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the effective income tax rate decreased to 26.0 from 26.6 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the settlement of an uncertain tax position for state income taxes during the third quarter of 2024. For additional information, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I - Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The following is a discussion of our results of operations and income statement data on a consolidated basis. 
 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Revenue: Finance charges 1,474.5 1,303.8 170.7 13.1 Premiums earned 71.3 58.0 13.3 22.9 Other income 50.7 48.5 2.2 4.5 Total revenue 1,596.5 1,410.3 186.2 13.2 Costs and expenses: Salaries and wages 231.6 214.1 17.5 8.2 General and administrative 75.9 59.8 16.1 26.9 Sales and marketing 72.4 70.9 1.5 2.1 Total operating expenses 379.9 344.8 35.1 10.2 Provision for credit losses on forecast changes 430.9 319.4 111.5 34.9 Provision for credit losses on new Consumer Loan assignments 260.4 253.1 7.3 2.9 Total provision for credit losses 691.3 572.5 118.8 20.8 Interest 308.2 187.7 120.5 64.2 Provision for claims 55.8 54.1 1.7 3.1 Loss on sale of building 23.7 23.7 Total costs and expenses 1,458.9 1,159.1 299.8 25.9 Income before provision for income taxes 137.6 251.2 (113.6) -45.2 Provision for income taxes 41.6 58.7 (17.1) -29.1 Net income 96.0 192.5 (96.5) -50.1 Net income per share: Basic 7.78 14.79 (7.01) -47.4 Diluted 7.68 14.73 (7.05) -47.9 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 12,345,739 13,013,344 (667,605) -5.1 Diluted 12,494,011 13,068,998 (574,987) -4.4 
 
 Finance Charges. The increase of 170.7 million, or 13.1 , was primarily a result of an increase in the average net Loans receivable balance, as follows:

 The following table summarizes the impact each component had on the overall increase in finance charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 (In millions) Year over Year Change Impact on finance charges: For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Due to an increase in the average net Loans receivable balance 175.7 Due to a decrease in the average yield (5.0) Total increase in finance charges 170.7 
 The increase in the average net Loans receivable balance was primarily due to the dollar volume of new Consumer Loan assignments exceeding the principal collected on Loans receivable. 
 
 Premiums Earned. The increase of 13.3 million, or 22.9 , was primarily due to growth in the size of our reinsurance portfolio, which resulted from growth in new Consumer Loan assignments and an increase in the average premium written per reinsured vehicle service contract in recent periods. 
 
 Operating Expenses. The increase of 35.1 million, or 10.2 , was primarily due to: 
 An increase in salaries and wages expense of 17.5 million, or 8.2 , primarily due to increases in (i) the number of team members as we are investing in our business with the goal of increasing the speed at which we enhance our product for Dealers and consumers and (ii) fringe benefits, primarily due to higher medical claims. 
 An increase in general and administrative expense of 16.1 million, or 26.9 , primarily due to increases in legal and technology systems expenses. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses . The increase of 118.8 million, or 20.8 , was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses on forecast changes. 
 
 We recognize provision for credit losses on new Consumer Loan assignments for contractual net cash flows that are not expected to be realized at the time of assignment. We also recognize provision for credit losses on forecast changes in the amount and timing of expected future net cash flows subsequent to assignment. The following table summarizes the provision for credit losses for each of these components: 
 
 (In millions) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Provision for Credit Losses 2024 2023 Change Forecast changes 430.9 319.4 111.5 New Consumer Loan assignments 260.4 253.1 7.3 Total 691.3 572.5 118.8 
 
 The increase in provision for credit losses related to forecast changes was primarily due to a greater decline in Consumer Loan performance during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we decreased our estimate of future net cash flows by 282.9 million, or 2.8 , to reflect a decline in forecasted collection rates during the period and slowed our forecasted net cash flow timing to reflect a decrease in Consumer Loan prepayments, which remain at below-average levels. Historically, Consumer Loan prepayments have been lower in periods with less availability of consumer credit. The 282.9 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows for the first nine months of 2024 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of 135.7 million, or 1.4 , and an adjustment applied to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2024, which upon implementation, reduced forecasted net cash flows by 147.2 million, or 1.4 , and increased our provision for credit losses by 127.5 million. Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 had continued to underperform our expectations for several quarters. More recently, Consumer Loans assigned in 2023 had also begun exhibiting similar trends of underperformance, although not as severe as Consumer Loans assigned in 2022. During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience to estimate the magnitude by which we expected Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 would likely underperform our historical collection rates on Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. Accordingly, we applied an adjustment to Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 to reduce forecasted collection rates to what we believed the ultimate collection rates would be based on these trends.

Table of Contents 

 During the first nine months of 2023, we decreased our estimate of future net cash flows by 149.3 million, or 1.7 , to reflect a decline in Consumer Loan prepayments to below-average levels. The 149.3 million decrease in forecasted net cash flows for the first nine months of 2023 was composed of an ordinary decrease in forecasted net cash flows of 104.8 million, or 1.2 , and an adjustment to our forecasting methodology during the second quarter of 2023, which upon implementation, decreased our estimate of future net cash flows by 44.5 million, or 0.5 , and increased our provision for credit losses by 71.3 million. We adjusted our methodology for forecasting the amount and timing of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio through the utilization of more recent Consumer Loan performance and Consumer Loan prepayment data. 
 
 For additional information, see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I - Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 The increase in provision for credit losses related to new Consumer Loan assignments was due to a 21.0 increase in Consumer Loan assignment unit volume, partially offset by a 15.0 decrease in the average provision per Consumer Loan assignment. The decrease in the average provision per Consumer Loan assignment was due to a lower percentage of Purchased Loans in the mix of Consumer Loan assignments received during 2024, and a decrease in the average advance rates under our Portfolio and Purchase Programs for 2024 Consumer Loans. 
 
 Interest. The increase in interest expense of 120.5 million, or 64.2 , was due to: 
 An increase in our average cost of debt, which increased interest expense by 80.2 million, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on recently completed or extended secured financings and recently issued senior notes and the repayment of older secured financings and senior notes with lower interest rates. 
 An increase in our average outstanding debt balance, which increased interest expense by 40.3 million, primarily due to borrowings used to fund the growth of our Loan portfolio and stock repurchases. 
 
 The following table presents the change in interest expense, average outstanding debt balance, and average cost of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 (Dollars in millions) For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Interest expense 308.2 187.7 120.5 Average outstanding debt balance 5,732.1 4,718.7 1,013.4 Average cost of debt 7.2 5.3 1.9 
 
 Loss on Sale of Building. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a loss on the sale of a building of 23.7 million. For additional information, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I - Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective income tax rate increased to 30.2 from 23.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to: 
 An increase in the impact of state and local income taxes on our effective income tax rate, primarily due to an adjustment to an uncertain tax position estimate during the second quarter of 2024 and changes in state tax laws that were enacted during 2024. 
 A decrease in the impact of excess tax benefits on our effective income tax rate, primarily due to the timing of long-term stock award grants. 
 An increase in the impact of non-deductible executive compensation expense on our effective income tax rate, primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income. 
 
 For additional information, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I - Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which i s incorporated herein by reference. 

Properties 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our work environment, as the vast majority of our team members began working remotely. Because our remote operations and processes proved successful early on, we now pursue a remote first strategy to take advantage of the national talent pool and an increased rate of team member satisfaction. While remote work has become the primary experience for most of our team members, we do have team members that, due to their personal preference or the nature of their responsibilities, have continued to work primarily in one of our office properties. Additionally, 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 we have various on-site meetings, events, and team building activities for which in-person attendance is encouraged. Therefore, we believe we have a continuing need for some amount of office space. 
 
 As the vast majority of our team members now work remotely, we had significant excess space in the two office buildings that we owned in Southfield, Michigan. During the second quarter of 2024, we sold the larger building for net sales proceeds of 3.2 million, and recognized a loss on sale of the building of 23.7 million. The loss on sale of the building represented the amount by which the 26.9 million carrying value of the building and its improvements, the related land and land improvements, and office furniture and equipment exceeded the net sales proceeds of 3.2 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We need capital to maintain and grow our business. Our primary sources of capital are cash flows from operating activities, collections of Consumer Loans, and borrowings under: (1) our revolving secured line of credit facility; (2) Warehouse facilities; (3) Term ABS financings; and (4) senior notes. There are various restrictive covenants to which we are subject under each financing arrangement, and we were in compliance with those covenants as of September 30, 2024. For information regarding these financings and the covenants included in the related documents, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I - Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 On February 16, 2024, we extended the 100.0 million Term ABS 2021-1 financing and extended the date on which the financing will cease to revolve from December 16, 2024 to February 17, 2026. 
 
 On February 27, 2024, we completed a 200.0 million Term ABS financing, which was used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The financing has an expected average annualized cost of 7.8 (including placement agent fees and other costs), and it will revolve for 36 months, after which it will amortize based upon the cash flows on the underlying Loans. 
 
 On March 28, 2024, we completed a 500.0 million Term ABS financing, which was used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The financing has an expected average annualized cost of 6.4 (including initial purchasers fees and other costs), and it will revolve for 24 months, after which it will amortize based upon the cash flows on the underlying Loans. 
 
 On June 17, 2024, we extended the maturity of our revolving secured line of credit facility from June 22, 2026 to June 22, 2027. The interest rate on borrowings under the facility has changed from the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate plus 187.5 basis points to SOFR plus 197.5 basis points. 
 
 On June 20, 2024, we completed a 550.0 million Term ABS financing, which was used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The financing has an expected average annualized cost of 6.5 (including initial purchasers fees and other costs), and it will revolve for 24 months, after which it will amortize based upon the cash flows on the underlying Loans. 
 
 On June 21, 2024, we increased the financing amount on the Term ABS 2022-2 financing from 200.0 million to 300.0 million and extended the date on which the financing will cease to revolve from December 15, 2025 to June 15, 2027. 
 
 On September 19, 2024, we increased the financing amount on Warehouse Facility II from 400.0 million to 500.0 million and extended the date on which the facility will cease to revolve from April 30, 2026 to September 20, 2027. The interest rate on borrowings under the facility has been decreased from SOFR plus 230 basis points to SOFR plus 185 basis points. 
 
 On September 19, 2024, we extended the date on which the 500.0 million Term ABS 2019-2 financing will cease to revolve from August 15, 2025 to September 15, 2026 and increased the interest rate under the financing from 5.15 to 5.43 . 
 
 On September 26, 2024, we completed a 600.0 million Term ABS financing, which was used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The financing has an expected average annualized cost of 5.2 (including initial purchasers fees and other costs), and it will revolve for 24 months, after which it will amortize based upon the cash flows on the underlying Loans. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 159.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 13.2 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 1,684.0 million and 1,505.8 million, respectively, in unused and 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 available lines of credit. Our total balance sheet indebtedness increased to 6,248.9 million as of September 30, 2024 from 5,067.5 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to the growth in new Consumer Loan assignments and stock repurchases. 

A summary of our scheduled principal debt maturities as of September 30, 2024 is as follows: 
 (In millions) Year Scheduled Principal Debt Maturities (1) Remainder of 2024 208.2 2025 1,344.8 2026 2,539.0 2027 1,528.0 2028 670.6 Over five years Total 6,290.6 
 (1) The principal maturities of certain financings are estimated based on forecasted collections. 
 
 Based upon anticipated cash flows, management believes that cash flows from operations and our various financing alternatives will provide sufficient financing for debt maturities and for future operations. Our ability to borrow funds may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions. If the various financing alternatives were to become limited or unavailable to us, our operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we review our accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 discusses several critical accounting estimates, which we believe involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. There have been no material changes to the estimates and assumptions associated with these accounting estimates from those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as described below. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we applied an adjustment to our methodology for forecasting the amount of future net cash flows from our Loan portfolio, which reduced the forecasted collection rates for Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024. Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 had continued to underperform our expectations for several quarters. More recently, Consumer Loans assigned in 2023 had also begun exhibiting similar trends of underperformance, although not as severe as Consumer Loans assigned in 2022. During the second quarter of 2024, we determined that we had sufficient Consumer Loan performance experience to estimate the magnitude by which we expected Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 would likely underperform our historical collection rates on Consumer Loans with similar characteristics. Accordingly, we applied an adjustment to Consumer Loans assigned in 2022 through 2024 to reduce forecasted collection rates to what we believed the ultimate collection rates would be based on these trends. Changes in the amount and timing of forecasted net cash flows are recognized in the period of change as a provision for credit losses. The implementation of this forecast adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 reduced forecasted net cash flows by 147.2 million, or 1.4 , and increased provision for credit losses by 127.5 million.

 Industry, Operational, and Macroeconomic Risks 
 Our inability to accurately forecast and estimate the amount and timing of future collections could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. 
 Due to competition from traditional financing sources and non-traditional lenders, we may not be able to compete successfully. 
 Adverse changes in economic conditions, the automobile or finance industries, or the non-prime consumer market could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations, the ability of key vendors that we depend on to supply us with services, and our ability to enter into future financing transactions. 
 Reliance on third parties to administer our ancillary product offerings could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 We are dependent on our senior management and the loss of any of these individuals or an inability to hire additional team members could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. 
 Our reputation is a key asset to our business, and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace. 
 An outbreak of contagious disease or other public health emergency could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. 
 The concentration of Dealers in several states could adversely affect us. 
 Reliance on our outsourced business functions could adversely affect our business. 
 Our ability to hire and retain foreign engineering personnel could be hindered by immigration restrictions. 
 We may be unable to execute our business strategy due to current economic conditions. 
 Natural disasters, climate change, military conflicts, acts of war, terrorist attacks and threats, or the escalation of military activity in response to terrorist attacks or otherwise may negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Governmental or market responses to climate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 A small number of our shareholders have the ability to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval and such shareholders have interests which may conflict with the interests of our other security holders. 
 
 Capital and Liquidity Risks 
 We may be unable to continue to access or renew funding sources and obtain capital needed to maintain and grow our business. 
 The terms of our debt limit how we conduct our business. 
 A violation of the terms of our asset-backed secured financings or revolving secured warehouse facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operations. 
 Our substantial debt could negatively impact our business, prevent us from satisfying our debt obligations, and adversely affect our financial condition. 
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding debt and fund operations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such debt. 
 Interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our borrowing costs, profitability, and liquidity. 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 Reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We may incur substantially more debt and other liabilities. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our current debt levels. 
 The conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets may adversely affect lenders with which we have relationships, causing us to incur additional costs and reducing our sources of liquidity, which may adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. 
 
 Technology and Cybersecurity Risks 
 Our dependence on technology could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We depend on secure information technology, and a breach of our systems or those of our third-party service providers could result in our experiencing significant financial, legal, and reputational exposure and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our use of electronic contracts could impact our ability to perfect our ownership or security interest in Consumer Loans. 
 Failure to properly safeguard confidential consumer and team member information could subject us to liability, decrease our profitability, and damage our reputation. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 Litigation we are involved in from time to time may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Changes in tax laws and the resolution of uncertain income tax matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operations. 
 The regulations to which we are or may become subject could result in a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Other factors not currently anticipated by management may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We do not undertake, and expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter our statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 PART II. - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 In the normal course of business and as a result of the consumer-oriented nature of the industry in which we operate, we and other industry participants are frequently subject to various consumer claims, litigation, and regulatory investigations seeking damages, fines, and statutory penalties. The claims allege, among other theories of liability, violations of state, federal, and foreign truth-in-lending, credit availability, credit reporting, consumer protection, warranty, debt collection, insurance, and other consumer-oriented laws and regulations, including claims seeking damages for alleged physical and mental harm relating to the repossession and sale of consumers vehicles and other debt collection activities. As the assignee of Consumer Loans originated by Dealers, we may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against Dealers. We may also have disputes and litigation with Dealers. The claims may allege, among other theories of liability, that we breached the Dealer servicing agreement. We may also have disputes and litigation with vendors and other third parties. The claims may allege, among other theories of liability, that we breached a license agreement or contract. The damages, fines, and penalties that may be claimed by consumers, regulatory agencies, Dealers, vendors, or other third parties in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by plaintiffs varies but may include requests for compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages and injunctive relief, and plaintiffs may seek treatment as purported class actions or they may file individual arbitration demands for which arbitration providers may request separate filing fees. An adverse ultimate disposition in any action to which we are a party or otherwise subject, or the requirement to pay filing fees for a large number of individual arbitration demands, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. 
 
 For a description of significant litigation to which we are a party, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I - Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.

In performing its duties as Servicer, the Servicer shall use the same degree of care and attention it employs with respect to similar contracts and loans which it services for itself or others. Each of the Borrower, the Deal Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties hereby appoints as its agent the Servicer, from time to time designated pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof, to enforce its respective rights and interests in and under the Collateral. If the Servicer shall commence a legal proceeding to enforce a Loan or a Contract (for purposes of collection or otherwise), or if in any enforcement or other legal proceeding it shall be held that the Servicer may not enforce a Loan or a Contract, on the grounds that it shall not be a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Loan or Contract or on similar grounds, the Collateral Agent shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically assigned to the Servicer, solely for the purpose of enforcement, such Loan or Contract. Without limiting the foregoing, the Collateral Agent (and the Lender, if applicable) shall furnish the Servicer with an affidavit prepared by the Servicer that the Servicer may use in any such legal proceedings confirming the Servicer s power and authority to sue and otherwise enforce the Loans and Contracts in its own name, consistent with this Section 6.2, and any powers of attorney or other documents prepared by the Servicer reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.

If the number of Contracts for which any of the foregoing documents have not been delivered to the Custodian within 180 days of the Closing Date or relevant Funding Date, as the case may be, or corrected (each such Contract, a Nonconforming Contract ), exceeds 2 of the aggregate Contract Files required to be reviewed pursuant to this Section 6.2(c)(ii), the Borrower shall make a deposit to the Reserve Account only with respect to the excess number of Nonconforming Contracts, in an amount equal to the related Nonconforming Contract Payment Amount.

The Borrower shall, in the case of an increase, promptly deposit to the Reserve Account the amount of any such increase. In the case of a decrease, the amount of any such decrease shall be deemed to be part of the Excess Reserve Amount.

 (d) (i) If (A) an Unsatisfactory Audit occurs or (B) a Servicer Termination Event or potential Servicer Termination Event occurs, the Deal Agent shall have the right to terminate Credit Acceptance as the Custodian hereunder and the Deal Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor Custodian hereunder who shall assume all the rights and obligations of the Custodian hereunder. On the effective date of the termination of Credit Acceptance as Servicer, Credit Acceptance shall be released of all of its obligations as Custodian arising on or after such date.
