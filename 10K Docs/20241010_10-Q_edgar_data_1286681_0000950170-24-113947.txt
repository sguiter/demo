Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) 
 The 2024 and 2023 third quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended September 8, 2024 and September 10, 2023, respectively. The 2024 and 2023 three fiscal quarters referenced herein represent the thirty-six-week periods ended September 8, 2024 and September 10, 2023, respectively. In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024 as compared to the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Domino s is the largest pizza company in the world, with more than 21,000 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of September 8, 2024, and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. We are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large worldwide network of franchise owners and U.S. Company-owned stores through both the delivery and carryout service models. We have been selling quality, affordable food to our customers since 1960. We became Domino s Pizza in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967. Over more than 60 years, we have built Domino s into one of the most widely-recognized consumer brands in the world. We believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand. 
 
 We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 99 of Domino s global stores owned and operated by our independent franchisees as of September 8, 2024. Franchising enables an individual to be a business owner and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the Domino s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us. 
 
 Domino s business model is straightforward: Domino s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. 
 
 Domino s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. Royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the Domino s brand marks. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations primarily in the U.S. and Canada and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the United States. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino s Pizza brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit from the franchise model, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. 
 
 Domino s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, through an asset-light model. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Domino s financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchised and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are primarily driven by same store sales growth and net store growth. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. 
 
 At Domino s, we believe we have a proven business model for success that has historically driven strong returns for our shareholders. In 2023, we announced our Hungry for MORE strategy aimed at generating MORE sales, MORE stores and MORE profits. The strategic imperatives of our Hungry for MORE strategy are as follows: 
 
 Most Delicious Food: We believe we have the best pizza in the industry, and our menu has even more mouthwatering options beyond pizza. We will continue to showcase the breadth of our menu, while highlighting the deliciousness of our food through our innovative marketing promotions. 
 
 Operational Excellence: We are relentless in our focus on convenience, consistency and efficiency for our customers. 
 
 Renowned Value: We are committed to continuing to offer competitive pricing and personalized value for our customers that is innovative and memorable. 
 
 Enhanced by Best-in-Class Franchisees: Our franchisees play a vital role in driving results and excitement across the more than 90 markets in which we operate.

Third Quarter of 2024 Highlights 
 
 MORE Sales: Global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact (which includes total retail sales at Company-owned and franchised stores worldwide), increased 5.1 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. U.S. retail sales increased 5.1 and international retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 5.1 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. Same store sales increased 3.0 in our U.S. stores and increased 0.8 in our international stores (excluding foreign currency impact). 

MORE Stores: Global net store growth of 72. 

MORE Profits: Income from operations increased 5.0 . 

Three Fiscal Quarters of 2024 Highlights 
 
 MORE Sales: Global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact (which includes total retail sales at Company-owned and franchised stores worldwide), increased 6.5 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2023. U.S. retail sales increased 6.6 and international retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 6.5 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2023. Same store sales increased 4.5 in our U.S. stores and increased 1.1 in our international stores (excluding foreign currency impact). 

MORE Stores: Global net store growth of 411. 

MORE Profits: Income from operations increased 7.7 . 

Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, Domino s experienced global retail sales growth during the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024, driven by same store sales growth and net store growth in both our U.S. and international businesses. These factors also contributed to an increase in income from operations. In the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024, these increases in income from operations were partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses primarily driven by higher labor costs. Overall, we believe our global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) and our emphasis on technology, operations and marketing initiatives have combined to strengthen our brand. These financial and statistical measures are described in additional detail below. 
 
 Statistical Measures 
 
 The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. 
 
 Global Retail Sales 
 
 Global retail sales is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchised stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino s Pizza brand, and we believe they are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. As a result, sales by Domino s franchisees have a direct effect on our profitability. Retail sales for franchised stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues.

Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact) 
 
 Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. Changes in global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact are primarily driven by same store sales growth and net store growth.

Same Store Sales Growth 
 
 Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated for a given period by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both periods. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis, which reflects changes in international local currency sales. Same store sales growth for transferred stores is reflected in their current classification.

The increases in the U.S. in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024 were primarily driven by higher same store sales in both our delivery and carryout businesses, driven by our Domino s Rewards loyalty program and other national offers. International same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) increased 0.8 in the third quarter of 2024, rolling over an increase in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) of 3.3 in the third quarter of 2023.

The increases in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024 were driven primarily by a higher average ticket per transaction across our international markets.

Store Growth Activity 
 
 Net store growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Net store growth is calculated by netting gross store openings with gross store closures during the period. Transfers between Company-owned stores and franchised stores are excluded from the calculation of net store growth.

Russia Market 
 
 On August 21, 2023, our master franchisee that owned and operated Domino s Pizza stores in Russia announced its intent to file for bankruptcy with respect to the stores in that market. Therefore, as of August 21, 2023, we have considered the stores in the Russia market to be closed and they are excluded from our ending store count as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. We have presented our statistical measure of global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024 excluding the impact of the retail sales from the Russia market. We believe the impact of the Russia market on our statistical measure of same store sales growth for the periods presented was immaterial, and we also believe the impact of the Russia market on our consolidated statements of income related to international franchise royalties and fee revenues and general and administrative expenses for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023 was immaterial.

Revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our Company-owned stores, royalties and fees and advertising contributions from our U.S. franchised stores, royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our U.S. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. 
 Consolidated revenues increased 52.8 million, or 5.1 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. Consolidated revenues increased 186.1 million, or 6.0 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2023. The increases in consolidated revenues in both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024 were primarily driven by higher supply chain and U.S. stores revenues. These changes in revenues are described in more detail below.

U.S. Company-owned Stores 
 
 Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations increased 2.9 million, or 3.4 , in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 15.2 million, or 5.9 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 primarily due to higher same store sales. 
 
 U.S. Company-owned same store sales increased 3.1 in the third quarter of 2024 and increased 2.9 in the third quarter of 2023. U.S. Company-owned same store sales increased 5.4 in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 and increased 5.2 in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. 
 
 U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees 
 
 Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased 5.8 million, or 4.2 , in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher same store sales and net store growth. Additionally, U.S. franchise royalties and fees benefited from an increase in digital transactions which resulted in an increase in fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms, but this increase was offset by a 0.04 decrease in the digital per transaction technology fee to 0.355 effectuated as of March 25, 2024. Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased 31.7 million, or 7.7 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 primarily due to higher same store sales and an increase in fees paid by U.S. franchisees for the use of our technology platforms, as well as net store growth. 
 
 U.S. franchise same store sales increased 3.0 in the third quarter of 2024 and declined 0.7 in the third quarter of 2023. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 4.4 in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 and increased 0.8 in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. 

18 

U.S. Franchise Advertising 
 
 Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased 9.4 million, or 8.4 , in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to the return to the standard 6.0 advertising contribution rate at the beginning of the second quarter of 2024 following the end of the temporary reduction to 5.75 which began in the second quarter of 2023, as well as higher same store sales and net store growth. An increase in brand promotions partially offset the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenues in the third quarter of 2024. Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased 20.5 million, or 6.1 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 primarily due to higher same store sales, net store growth and the return to the standard 6.0 advertising contribution rate at the beginning of the second quarter of 2024 following the end of the temporary reduction to 5.75 which began in the second quarter of 2023. An increase in brand promotions partially offset the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2024. 
 
 Supply Chain 
 
 Supply chain revenues increased 33.2 million, or 5.4 , in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher order volumes, as well as an increase in our food basket pricing to stores, but these increases were partially offset by a shift in the relative mix of products we sell. Our food basket pricing to stores increased 1.3 in the third quarter of 2024, which resulted in an estimated 9 million increase in supply chain revenues. The food basket pricing change, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the percentage change of the food basket (including both food and cardboard products) purchased by an average U.S. store (based on average weekly unit sales) from our U.S. supply chain centers against the comparable period of the prior year. We believe this measure is important to understanding Company performance because as our food basket prices fluctuate, our revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate. Supply chain revenues increased 111.7 million, or 6.0 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 primarily due to higher order volumes, but this increase was partially offset by a shift in the relative mix of products we sell. Our food basket pricing was flat in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2023. 
 
 International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues 
 Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased 1.5 million, or 2.0 , in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 7.0 million, or 3.3 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 primarily due to an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth as well as same store sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact), but these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 1.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 5.6 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2024. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the difference in international franchise royalty revenues resulting from translating current year local currency results to U.S. dollars at current year exchange rates as compared to prior year exchange rates. We believe this measure is important to understanding Company performance given the significant variability in international franchise royalty revenues that can be driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 International franchise same store sales increased 0.8 in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 3.3 in the third quarter of 2023, each excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. International franchise same store sales increased 1.1 in the three fiscal quarters of 2024, and increased 2.6 in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, each excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

Consolidated cost of sales consists of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated gross margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased 25.5 million, or 6.4 , in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 94.2 million, or 7.9 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 primarily due to higher global franchise revenues, as well as gross margin dollar growth within supply chain, discussed below. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on gross margin. Additionally, as food basket prices fluctuate, revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate, and further, cost of sales, gross margins and gross margin percentages for our U.S. Company-owned stores also fluctuate. 
 As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated gross margin increased 0.4 and 0.7 percentage points in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024, respectively. U.S. Company-owned store gross margin increased 1.0 percentage point in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 0.2 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2024. Supply chain gross margin increased 0.6 percentage points in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 1.1 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2024. These changes in gross margin are described in more detail below.

U.S. Company-owned store gross margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) increased 1.3 million, or 9.6 , in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 3.1 million, or 7.0 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024. As a percentage of store revenues, U.S. Company-owned store gross margin increased 1.0 percentage point in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 0.2 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2024. These changes in gross margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in additional detail below. 
 Food costs were 29.0 in both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. Food costs decreased 0.2 percentage points to 28.8 in the three fiscal quarters of 2024. 

Labor costs decreased 0.7 percentage points to 31.1 in the third quarter of 2024 due to sales leverage driven by higher customer transaction counts, as well as store level productivity. Labor costs increased 0.1 percentage points to 31.3 in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 due to higher wage rates in our U.S. Company-owned stores. 

Sales leverage driven by higher customer transaction counts contributed to the remaining increases in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin as a percentage of revenues.

As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain gross margin increased 0.6 percentage points in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 1.1 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2024. The increases in supply chain gross margin as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024 were primarily due to procurement productivity.

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased 6.8 million, or 7.0 , in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 30.8 million, or 10.6 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024, each primarily driven by higher labor costs. 
 
 U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses 
 	 
 U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased 9.4 million, or 8.4 , in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 20.5 million, or 6.1 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 consistent with the increases in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the Domino s brand, and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Refranchising Loss 
 
 During each of the first and second quarters of 2024, we refranchised one U.S. Company-owned store for proceeds of less than 0.1 million each. The pre-tax refranchising losses associated with the sale of the related assets and liabilities, including goodwill, were approximately 0.1 million each and were recorded in refranchising loss in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023, we refranchised one U.S. Company-owned store for proceeds of less than 0.1 million. The pre-tax refranchising loss associated with the sale of the related assets and liabilities, including goodwill, was approximately 0.1 million and was recorded in refranchising loss in our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024, we recorded a 26.2 million and 18.9 million unrealized gain, respectively, on our investment in DPC Dash (Note 6). During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023, we recorded a 28.2 million and 13.3 million unrealized gain, respectively, on our investment in DPC Dash. These unrealized gains were based on the active exchange quoted price for the equity security. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net, decreased 1.7 million, or 4.0 , in the third quarter of 2024, and decreased 5.6 million, or 4.4 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024, each driven by higher interest income on our cash equivalents. 
 Our weighted average borrowing rate was 3.8 in each of the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024 and 2023. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes increased 9.8 million, or 35.1 , in the third quarter of 2024 due to a higher effective tax rate and higher income before provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate increased to 20.4 in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 15.9 in the third quarter of 2023, driven by lower foreign tax credits as well as a 0.9 percentage point unfavorable change in the impact of excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation, which is recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes. 
 Provision for income taxes increased 1.4 million, or 1.6 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 due to higher income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate decreased to 17.3 in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 as compared to 19.0 in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, driven by a 3.7 percentage point favorable change in the impact of excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation, which is recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes.

Segment Income 
 We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs.

U.S. Stores 
 U.S. stores Segment Income increased 8.2 million, or 6.8 , in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, as well as the 1.3 million increase in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, each as discussed above. U.S. stores Segment Income increased 37.6 million, or 10.5 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 primarily due to higher U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, as well as the 3.1 million increase in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, each as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income. 
 
 Supply Chain 
 Supply chain Segment Income increased 5.9 million, or 10.7 , in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to the 7.6 million increase in supply chain gross margin, as discussed above. Supply chain Segment Income increased 26.9 million, or 16.4 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 primarily due to the 32.0 million increase in supply chain gross margin, as discussed above. 
 
 International Franchise 
 International franchise Segment Income increased 0.9 million, or 1.5 , in the third quarter of 2024, and increased 2.3 million, or 1.3 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 primarily due to higher international franchise royalties and fees revenues, as discussed above. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income. The increase in international franchise Segment Income in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 was partially offset by expenses for our Worldwide Rally that takes place every two years. 
 
 Other 
 Other Segment Income decreased 3.0 million, or 15.2 , in the third quarter of 2024, and decreased 12.8 million, or 23.5 , in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 primarily driven by higher labor costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. As of September 8, 2024, we had working capital of 174.4 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of 185.4 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of 111.1 million and advertising fund liabilities of 109.2 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 189.1 million. 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes (as defined below). During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024, we experienced an increase in both U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) versus the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, both our U.S. and international businesses grew store counts during the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. In addition to our cash flows from operations, we have two variable funding note facilities. These facilities include our Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes (the 2022 Variable Funding Notes ), which allows for advances of up to 120.0 million, as well as our Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes (the 2021 Variable Funding Notes, and, together with the 2022 Variable Funding Notes, the 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes ), which allows for advances of up to 200.0 million and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit. The letters of credit primarily relate to our casualty insurance programs. As of September 8, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and 278.9 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of 41.1 million. 
 
 We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, any excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business and other strategic opportunities, repay outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock. 
 
 Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our outstanding senior notes and to service, extend or refinance our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
 
 Restricted Cash 
 As of September 8, 2024, we had 134.2 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, 51.0 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and 0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of 185.4 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of September 8, 2024, we also held 90.0 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino s brand. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 As of September 8, 2024, we had approximately 4.98 billion of long-term debt, of which 4.9 million was classified as a current liability. As of September 8, 2024, our fixed rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 had original scheduled principal payments of 38.6 million in the remainder of 2024, 1.17 billion in 2025, 39.3 million in 2026, 1.31 billion in 2027, 811.5 million in 2028, 625.9 million in 2029, 10.0 million in 2030 and 905.0 million in 2031. However, in accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on our outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our Holdco Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related agreements, and no catch-up provisions are applicable. As of the end of the first, second, and third quarters of 2024, we had a Holdco Leverage Ratio of less than 5.0x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payments on our outstanding notes beginning in the second quarter of 2024. Accordingly, all principal amounts of our outstanding notes have been classified as long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 8, 2024. 
 
 The notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. The covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of 1.75x total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the related agreements. In the event that certain covenants are not met, the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule. 
 
 23 

Share Repurchase Programs 
 
 Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes. On February 21, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized an additional share repurchase program to repurchase up to 1.0 billion of our common stock, in addition to the 141.3 million that was previously remaining for a total authorization of 1.14 billion for future share repurchases as of that date. 
 During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2024, we repurchased and retired 443,302 and 499,674 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately 190.0 million and 215.0 million, respectively. As of September 8, 2024, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately 926.3 million. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 On July 16, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a 1.51 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 13, 2024, which was paid on September 30, 2024. We had approximately 54.1 million accrued for common stock dividends at September 8, 2024. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2024, on October 8, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a 1.51 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of December 13, 2024, to be paid on December 27, 2024.

Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased 24.7 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2024, as a result of higher net income, excluding non-cash operating activities and a positive change in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, partially offset by the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net income increased 52.9 million and non-cash adjustments increased 8.8 million, resulting in an overall increase to cash provided by operating activities in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2023 of 61.7 million. Additionally, an 8.3 million positive impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2023 was a result of receipts for advertising contributions outpacing payments for advertising activities. The negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of 45.3 million primarily related to timing of payments for accounts payable, accrued liabilities and income taxes in the three fiscal quarters of 2024 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 71.9 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2024, which primarily consisted of 70.8 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations). 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 313.0 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2024, which included the repurchase of approximately 215.0 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, dividend payments of 106.0 million, repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of 16.0 million and tax payments for the vesting of restricted stock of 10.7 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 34.7 million. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 For a description of the Company s critical accounting estimates, refer to Part II Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Form 10-K. The Company considers its most significant accounting policies and estimates to be long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.

Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market Risk 
 
 We do not engage in speculative transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into variable funding notes, and, at September 8, 2024, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes. As of September 8, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes. 
 
 Our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate Term SOFR ), plus a spread adjustment. Accordingly, a rising interest rate environment could result in higher interest expense due on borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. 
 
 Our fixed-rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. 
 
 We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food, cardboard and paper products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our product costs. Severe increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflation, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could also adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk, although we have not done so historically. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 
 We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.9 of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2024, approximately 6.8 of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2024, approximately 7.1 of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2023, and approximately 6.9 of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. We estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately 19.5 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2024. 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Russell J. Weiner, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Weiner and Mr. Reddy concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 During the quarterly period ended September 8, 2024, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 26 

PA RT II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices. In addition, we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits. 
 
 Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual litigated matters is unpredictable. These matters referenced above could be decided unfavorably to us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts that cannot be estimated with accuracy. However, we do not believe these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company, and we expect that the established accruals adequately provide for the estimated resolution of such claims.

As of September 8, 2024, 926.3 million remained available for future purchases of the Company s common stock under this share repurchase program. 

Authorization for the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.
