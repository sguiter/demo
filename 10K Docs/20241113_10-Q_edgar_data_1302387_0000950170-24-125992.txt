credit losses on AFS securities. For HTM debt securities, an allowance will be recognized when lifetime credit losses are expected, in an amount that reflects the expected contractual credit losses, even when the risk of such loss is remote. Any security, either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. Government is excluded from this analysis. This includes U.S. Treasury securities, securities issued by agencies of the U.S. Government and mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The allowance for credit losses ("ACL") for HTM securities is computed using bond global default rates tracked by S P with a loss given default of .

billion beginning in March 2000. The loss history is updated through the most recent quarter-end prior to the reporting period. The investor commercial real estate portfolio utilizes the national loss history for banks with assets less than billion over the same time period. Investor CRE loans are made nationwide, therefore, management deems it appropriate to utilize national loss rates when evaluating this portfolio. Adjustments are made to the historical loss factors under each scenario for economic conditions, portfolio concentrations, collateral values, the level and trend of delinquent and problem loans and internal changes in staffing, loan policies and monitoring of the portfolio. Loans are selected for individual evaluation primarily based on their payment status and whether the loan has been placed on non-accrual status. Loans on non-accrual status include all loans greater than 90 days delinquent and other loans with weaknesses sufficient for management to place these loans on non-accrual status. The ACL is measured on a collective basis when similar risk factors exist as determined by internal loan coding and assignment to a portfolio segment. The Company utilizes reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions when estimating the ACL on loans. The model's calculation also uses an adjustment for a 12-month forecast period utilizing the most recent 12-month economic forecast from the Federal Reserve Board for national gross domestic product ("GDP"). The model compares the average history of loss rates described above to the forecasted GDP to determine the value of the forward looking adjustment.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company determined that for its available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, it did not intend to sell nor was it more likely than not that it would be required to sell any security and that the decline in fair value was not due to credit factors, but due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Accordingly, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did t record an allowance for credit losses for its available-for-sale debt securities.

In the normal course of banking business, risks related to specific loan categories are as follows: Real Estate Loans Real estate loans are typically made to consumers and businesses and are secured by real estate. Credit risk arises from the borrower s continuing financial stability, which can be adversely impacted by the economy as well as borrower-specific occurrences. Also impacting credit risk would be a shortfall in the value of the real estate in relation to the outstanding loan balance in the event of a default or subsequent liquidation of the collateral. Residential lending repayment is generally dependent on economic and market conditions in the Company's lending area. Commercial real estate, commercial and construction loan repayments are generally dependent on the operations of the related properties or the financial condition of its borrower or guarantor. Accordingly, repayment of such loans can be more susceptible to adverse conditions in the real estate market and the regional economy. Marine Loans Marine loans are typically made to consumers and are secured by boats. Credit risk is similar to real estate loans above as it is subject to the borrower s continuing financial stability and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Marine loans may entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, as they are collateralized by assets that depreciate rapidly. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding. Other Consumer Other consumer loans include installment loans and personal lines of credit which may be secured or unsecured. Credit risk is similar to real estate loans above as it is subject to the borrower s continuing financial stability and the value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.

In accordance with the Company s policy, such interest income is recognized on a cash basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. The Company considers a loan to be past due or delinquent when the terms of the contractual obligation are not met by the borrower.

An institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, such that additional general or specific loss allowances may be required. In connection with the filing of our periodic reports with the FDIC and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Through our loan evaluation process, we have identified certain loans for which the primary source of loan repayment may no longer be a viable option. The Company is dependent on the liquidation of the collateral to provide funds for repayment of the loan.

The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a "countercyclical capital buffer" that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Bank.

Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Management s discussion and analysis is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The financial information in this section is derived from the accompanying financial statements. You should read the financial information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 22, 2024. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, assume, plan, seek, expect, will, may, should, indicate, would, contemplate, continue, intend, target and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; 

 statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; 

 statements regarding the quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and 

 estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 

 These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected, including as a result of unemployment levels and labor shortages, and any potential recession or slowed economic growth; 

 changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; 

 changes in the economic assumptions and methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses; 

 our ability to access cost-effective funding; 

 changes in liquidity, including the size and composition of our deposit portfolio and the percentage of uninsured deposits in the portfolio; 

 fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; 

 our continued ability to originate loans outside of our market area; 

 our ability to implement and change our business strategies; 

 competition among depository and other financial institutions; 

 inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of financial instruments or our level of loan originations or prepayments on loans we have made and make; 

 adverse changes in the securities markets; 

35 

BV FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital requirements and insurance premiums; 

 changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; 

 technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; 

 system failure or cyber-security breaches of our information technology infrastructure; 

 the failure to maintain current technologies and/or successfully implement future information technology enhancements; 

 the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected; 

 our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk in the current economic environment; 

 our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; 

 our ability to successfully integrate into our operations any assets, liabilities, customers, systems and management personnel we may acquire, and our ability to realize related revenue synergies and cost savings within expected time frames and any goodwill charges related thereto; 

 changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; 

 changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; 

 our ability to retain key employees; 

 our compensation expense associated with equity allocated or awarded to our employees; and 

 changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 

 Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law or regulation, we do not undertake, and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or to make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. Allowance for Credit Losses The ACL is an estimate of the expected credit losses for loans held for investment and for off-balance sheet exposures. ASC 326, "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses," requires an immediate recognition of the credit loss expected to occur over the lifetime of a financial asset whether originated or purchased. Charge-offs are recorded to the ACL when management believes a loan is uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL. Management believes the ACL is maintained in accordance with GAAP and in compliance with appropriate regulatory guidelines. The ACL includes quantitative estimates of losses for collectively and individually evaluated loans. The quantitative estimate for collectively evaluated loans (other than investor commercial real estate loans) is determined using the average charge-off method that utilizes historical losses for all Maryland banks with assets less than 1 billion beginning in March 2000. The investor commercial real estate portfolio utilizes the national loss history for banks with assets less than 1 billion over the same time period. Investor CRE loans are made nationwide, therefore, management deems it appropriate to utilize national loss rates when evaluating this portfolio. Adjustments are made to the historical loss factors under each scenario for economic conditions, portfolio concentrations, collateral values, the level and trend of delinquent and problem loans and internal changes in staffing, loan policies and monitoring of the portfolio. Loans are selected for individual evaluation primarily 

 36 

BV FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 based on their payment status and whether the loan has been placed on non-accrual status. Loans on non-accrual status include all loans greater than 90 days delinquent and other loans with weaknesses sufficient for management to place these loans on non-accrual status. The ACL is measured on a collective basis when similar risk factors exist as determined by internal loan coding and assignment to a portfolio segment. The Company utilizes reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions when estimating the ACL on loans. The model's calculation also uses an adjustment for a 12-month forecast period utilizing the most recent 12-month economic forecast from the Federal Reserve Board for national gross domestic product ("GDP"). The model compares the average history of loss rates described above to the forecasted GDP to determine the value of the forward-looking adjustment. The establishment of the ACL is significantly affected by management's judgment and by economic and other uncertainties, and different amounts may be reported under different conditions or assumptions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the ACL for reasonableness and, as a result of such reviews, we may be required to increase our ACL or recognize loan charge-offs. The calculation of ACL excludes accrued interest receivable balances because these balances are reversed in a timely manner against previously recognized interest income when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Goodwill The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates it is likely impairment has occurred. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. In any given year, the Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative impairment test is performed. In performing a quantitative test for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of the Company s market value, discounted cash flows, and peer values. The determination of goodwill impairment is sensitive to market-based economics and other key assumptions used in determining or allocating fair value. Variability in the market and changes in assumptions or subjective measurements used to estimate fair value are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed each year as of September 30. The Company performed its 2024 goodwill impairment qualitative assessment and determined its goodwill was not considered impaired. Deferred Income Taxes At September 30, 2024, we had a net deferred tax asset totaling 8.4 million. In accordance with ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes, we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If currently available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets are inherently subjective and are reviewed on a regular basis as regulatory or business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance that results in additional income tax expense in the period in which it is recognized would negatively affect income. Management believes, based upon current facts, that it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income in future years to realize its federal and state deferred tax asset.

BV FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 (unaudited) and December 31, 2023 Assets . Assets were 892.7 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.4 million, or 0.8 , from 885.3 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a 20.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents which was primarily offset by decreases of 11.6 million in loans and 2.0 million in other non-earning assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased 20.3 million, or 27.7 , to 93.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 73.5 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to the decreases in loans and other non-interest earning assets. Loans . Loans receivable decreased 11.6 million, or 1.6 , to 693.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 704.8 million at December 31, 2023. Decreases in one- to four-family real estate loans of 15.5 million and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans of 15.8 million were partially offset by increases in investor commercial real estate loans and commercial loans of 24.8 million. Allowance for Credit Losses . Our allowance for credit losses loans decreased 553,000 to 8.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 8.6 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the ACL resulted from lower historical loss rates and lower life of loan calculations. The ratio of our allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.15 at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, while the allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans was 201.60 at September 30, 2024 compared to 81.05 at December 31, 2023. Securities . Securities available for sale increased by 4.4 million, or 12.6 , to 39.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 34.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due to purchases used primarily to secure local government deposits offset by paydowns in the mortgage-backed securities. The held-to-maturity portfolio decreased by 4.2 million or 40.9 due to maturities and paydowns not being replaced by purchases. Liabilities. Liabilities decreased 3.2 million, or 0.5 , to 683.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 686.2 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to the decrease in borrowings as 3.0 million in junior subordinated debt was paid off in the first quarter of 2024. Deposits. Total deposits increased 193,000, or 0.03 to 634.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 634.1 million at December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits increased 2.9 million, or 0.6 , to 495.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 492.1 million at December 31, 2023. Noninterest bearing deposits decreased 2.7 million, or 1.9 , to 139.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 142.0 million at December 31, 2023. Stockholders Equity. Stockholders equity increased 10.6 million, or 5.4 , to 209.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 199.1 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to net income of 9.8 million.

BV FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Net Income. Net income was 3.8 million or 0.35 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.7 million or 0.35 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a recovery for credit losses of 714,000 as a result of the improvement in the asset quality of the Company s loan portfolio. In the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a recovery for credit loss of 333,000. Net income was 9.8 million or 0.91 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.7 million or 1.20 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 is that in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of foreclosed real estate of 678,000, a gain on the sale of fixed assets of 188,000 and received 225,000 in life insurance death benefits. These items did not recur in 2024. Interest Income . Interest income increased 435,000, or 3.7 , to 12.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income on loans, partially offset by a decrease in other interest income on cash and cash equivalents. Interest income on loans increased 759,000 or 7.8 , to 10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to increases in the average yield on loans. The average balance of loans decreased 12.1 million, or 1.7 , to 690.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 702.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average yield on loans increased 53 basis points to 6.05 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.52 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as variable rate loans reset to higher interest rates and the rates on new loans exceeded the rates on paid off loans due to the higher interest rate environment. Other interest income decreased related to interest income on cash, cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 370,000 to 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease in the average balance of cash, cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets. Interest income increased 2.8 million, or 8.9 , to 34.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 31.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to increases in interest income on loans, and, to a lesser extent, other interest income on cash, cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets. Interest income on loans increased 2.6 million, or 9.4 , to 30.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to increases in the average balance of loans and the average yield on loans. The average balance of loans increased 12.6 million, or 1.8 , to 701.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 688.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average yield on loans increased 40 basis points to 5.79 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as variable rate loans reset to higher interest rates and the rates on new loans exceeded the rates on paid off loans due to the higher interest rate environment. Other interest income on cash, cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets increased 100,000 to 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a 29 basis point increase in the average yield, offset by a slight decrease in the average balance of cash, cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets. Interest Expense . Interest expense remained unchanged at 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased 619,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as rates paid increased and depositors moved money into higher-cost certificates of deposit, offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowed money of 608,000 as there were no advances outstanding from the FHLB in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest expense on deposits was due to a 56 basis point increase in the average rate, offset by a 21.9 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to 490.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 512.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average rate on interest-bearing deposits was 1.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We had no interest expense on FHLB advances for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 530,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as all advances were paid off. Interest expense on subordinated debentures decreased 79,000, or 14.7 , to 466,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 545,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to the pay-off in the first quarter of 2024 of 3.0 million in junior subordinated debt assumed in a prior acquisition. 

 43 

BV FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 Interest expense increased 2.0 million, or 29.7 , to 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a 2.9 million increase in interest expense on deposits as rates paid increased and depositors moved money into higher-cost certificate of deposit accounts, and an increase of 364,000 in interest expense on subordinated debt, offset by a 1.3 million decrease in interest expense on borrowed money as there were no advances outstanding from the FHLB during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest expense on deposits was due to a 83 basis point increase in the average rate, offset by a 22.1 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to 493.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 515.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average rate on interest-bearing deposits was 1.78 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We had no interest expense on FHLB advances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as all advances were paid off. Interest expense on subordinated debentures increased 363,000, or 22.4 , to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average rate on subordinated debentures increased 171 basis points to 7.53 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.82 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to the write-off (increase in interest expense) of the remaining purchase accounting fair market value adjustment of 566,000 upon the pay-off in the first quarter of 2024 of 3.0 million in junior subordinated debt assumed in a prior acquisition. Net Interest Income . Net interest income was 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.49 compared to 4.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income was due to higher yields on interest-earning assets, and lower balances of interest-bearing liabilities offsetting higher rates paid on deposits. Net interest income was 26.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.25 compared to 4.15 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income was due to higher yields on interest earning assets, and lower balances of interest-bearing liabilities offsetting higher rates paid on deposits. Provision for Credit Losses . We recorded a recovery for credit losses of 714,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a recovery for credit losses of 333,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded a recovery of credit losses of 806,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a recovery of credit losses of 480,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our allowance for credit losses was 8.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 8.2 million at September 30, 2023. The ratio of our allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.15 at September 30, 2024 compared to 1.15 at September 30, 2023, while the allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans was 201.6 at September 30, 2024 compared to 213.5 at September 30, 2023. The Company had net recoveries on previously charged off loans of 132,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net recoveries of 255,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and net recoveries of 284,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net recoveries of 421,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Non-interest Income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled 696,000 compared to 882,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a gain of 188,000 on the sale of a former branch building. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income totaled 1.9 million as compared to 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a gain of 678,000 on the sale of foreclosed real estate, a gain of 188,000 on the sale of a former branch building and 225,000 in life insurance death benefits. Non-interest Expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense totaled 5.5 million compared to 5.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Compensation and benefits increased 344,000, or 10.9 , due to increases in salary and benefits. Professional fees increased by 180,000, or 81.9 , primarily due to legal and accounting costs 

 44 

BV FINANCIAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 related to the Company becoming a public company, and data processing expense increased by 21,000 or 6.2 . These increases were partially offset by decreases in all other categories of expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense totaled 15.3 million as compared to 14.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Compensation and benefits increased 827,000, or 9.3 , due to increases in staffing and salaries and benefits. Professional fees increased 160,000, or 26.8 , primarily due to legal and accounting costs related to the Company becoming a public company. Expenses also increased in the occupancy, data processing and other expense categories while decreases occurred in foreclosed real estate costs, equipment and advertising expenses. Income Tax Expense. We recognized income tax expense of 1.4 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, resulting in effective rates of 27.5 and 27.5 , respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized income tax expense of 3.8 million and 3.9 million, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 27.9 and 26.7 , respectively. Asset Quality. Non-performing assets at September 30, 2024 totaled 4.1 million consisting of 3.9 million in nonperforming loans and 160,000 in other real estate owned, compared to 10.7 million at December 31, 2023, consisting of 10.6 million in non-performing loans and 170,000 in other real estate owned. During the quarter, our largest loan on non-accrual, a 3.8 million investor commercial real estate loan paid off. At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses on loans was 8.0 million, which represented 1.15 of total loans and 201.6 of non-performing loans compared to 8.6 million at December 31, 2023, which represented 1.21 of total loans and 81.1 of non-performing loans. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity . Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB of Atlanta. At September 30, 2024, we had 151.6 million available under a line of credit with the FHLB of Atlanta, and had 23.0 million of FHLB in unfunded letters of credit used to secure municipal deposits outstanding against the line of credit with the FHLB of Atlanta. This resulted in additional borrowing availability from the FHLB of 128.6 million, none of which was outstanding at September 30, 2024. The Company also has a short-term unsecured facility from a correspondent bank in the amount of 20.0 million. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize FHLB advances, brokered deposits or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 10.0 million in brokered deposits and no brokered deposits at September 30, 2023. In addition, we had 57.7 million of municipal deposits at September 30, 2024, which represented 9.1 of total deposits. The Bank's uninsured deposits totaled 204.6 million, or 30.1 of total deposits, of which 51.6 million were secured using the market value of pledged collateral or letters of credit issued by FHLB, and an additional 45.4 million were deposits of the Company at the Bank. Capital Resources . At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements and was categorized as well capitalized. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category.

To the extent any shares of Stock covered by an Award (including Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units) under the Plan are not delivered to a Participant or beneficiary for any reason, including because the Award is forfeited or canceled or because a Stock Option is not exercised, then the shares shall not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of Stock available for delivery under the Plan. To the extent that: (i) a Stock Option is exercised by using an actual or constructive exchange of shares of Stock to pay the Exercise Price; (ii) shares of Stock are withheld to satisfy tax withholding upon exercise or vesting of an Award granted hereunder; or (iii) shares are withheld to satisfy the Exercise Price of Stock Options in a net settlement of Stock Options, then the number of shares of Stock available shall be reduced by the gross number of Stock Options exercised or Stock vested prior to the return of shares to satisfy tax withholding, rather than by the net number of shares of Stock issued.

For purposes of the Plan, unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred upon the earliest to occur of the following: (a) any person, as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (a Person ), is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing twenty five percent (25 or more of the combined voting power of the Company s then outstanding Voting Securities, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing and for all purposes of this Plan: (a) the term Person shall not include (1) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Plan), and any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under any such plan, or (3) a corporation or other entity owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of Stock of the Company; (b) no Person shall be deemed the beneficial owner of any securities acquired by such Person in an Excluded Transaction; and (c) no Director or officer of the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company (or any affiliate of any such Director or officer) shall, by reason of any or all of such Directors or officers acting in their capacities as such, be deemed to beneficially own any securities beneficially owned by any other such Director or officer (or any affiliate thereof); or (b) the Incumbent Directors cease, for any reason, to constitute a majority of the Whole Board; or (c) a plan of reorganization, merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company and one or more other corporations or entities is consummated, other than a plan of reorganization, merger, consolidation or similar transaction that is an Excluded Transaction, or the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company, or a sale, liquidation or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any bank Subsidiary of the Company is consummated; or (d) a tender offer is made for 25 or more of the outstanding Voting Securities of the Company and the stockholders owning beneficially or of record 25 or more of the outstanding Voting Securities of the Company have tendered or offered to sell their shares pursuant to such tender offer and such tendered shares have been accepted by the tender offeror and the tender offer is consummated.

(b) No Contractual Right to Employment or Future Awards.

The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant. The Company's obligation to deliver evidence of book entry (or stock certificates) to any Participant is subject to and conditioned on tax withholding obligations being satisfied by the Participant. 	(b) 	Payment in Stock. The Committee may require or permit the Company's tax withholding obligation to be satisfied, in whole or in part, by the Company withholding from shares of Stock to be issued pursuant to any Award a number of shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the withholding is effected) that would satisfy the withholding amount due; provided, however , that the amount withheld does not exceed the maximum statutory tax rate or such lesser amount as is necessary to avoid liability accounting treatment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, performance measures relating to any Award hereunder will be modified, to the extent applicable, to reflect a change in the outstanding shares of Stock of the Company by reason of any stock dividend or stock split, or a corporate transaction, such as a merger of the Company into another corporation, any separation of a corporation or any partial or complete liquidation by the Company or a Subsidiary. If a Participant is promoted, demoted or transferred to a different business unit during a performance period, the Committee may determine that the selected performance measures or applicable performance period are no longer appropriate, in which case, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may: (i) adjust, change or eliminate the performance measures or change the applicable performance period; or (ii) cause to be made a cash payment to the Participant in an amount determined by the Committee.

(2) The Participant s cessation as an Employee or service provider shall not be deemed to occur by reason of the Participant s being on a bona fide leave of absence from the Company or a Subsidiary approved by the Company or Subsidiary otherwise receiving the Participant s Services provided the leave of absence does not exceed six (6) months, or if longer, so long as the Employee retains a right to reemployment with the Company or Subsidiary under an applicable statute or by contract. For these purposes, a leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Employee will return to perform Services for the Company or Subsidiary. If the period of leave exceeds six (6) months and the Employee does not retain a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first day immediately following the six (6) month period.

For purposes of this Plan, a Separation from Service shall have occurred if the employer and Participant reasonably anticipate that no further Services will be performed by the Participant after the date of the Termination of Service (whether as an employee or as an independent contractor) or the level of further Services performed will be less than fifty percent (50 of the average level of bona fide Services in the thirty-six (36) months immediately preceding the Termination of Service.

(5) With respect to a Participant who is a Director, cessation as a Director will not be deemed to have occurred if the Participant continues as a director emeritus or advisory director. With respect to a Participant who is both an Employee and a Director, termination of employment as an Employee shall not constitute a Termination of Service for purposes of the Plan so long as the Participant continues to provide Service as a Director or director emeritus or advisory director.
