 and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. In accordance with ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), the Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses for trade receivables to present the net amount expected to be collected as of the balance sheet date. Such allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset which includes consideration of past events and historical loss experience, current events and also future events based on our expectation as of the balance sheet date. Receivables are written off when the Company determined that such receivables are deemed uncollectible. The Company pools its receivables based on similar risk characteristics in estimating its expected credit losses. In situations where a receivable does not share the same risk characteristics with other receivables, the Company measures those receivables individually. The Company also continuously evaluates such pooling decisions and adjusts as needed from period to period as risk characteristics change. The Company utilizes the loss rate method in determining its lifetime expected credit losses on its receivables. This method is used for calculating an estimate of losses based primarily on the Company s historical loss experience. In determining its loss rates, the Company evaluates information related to its historical losses, adjusted for current conditions and further adjusted for the period of time that can be reasonably forecasted. Qualitative and quantitative adjustments related to current conditions and the reasonable and supportable forecast period consider all the following: past due receivables, the customer creditworthiness, changes in the terms of receivables, effect of other external forces such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing receivables.

Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires assumptions and judgments about expected volatility, among other factors.

 Napco continually innovates through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces. Economic Conditions and Other Factors We are subject to the effects of general macroeconomic and market conditions. The markets for security devices and services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are continually developing new products and solutions for consumers and businesses. We must continue to evolve and adapt to respond to customer and user preferences over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company s significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in its 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires a high degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We continuously evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience, as well as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Critical estimates include management s judgments associated with reserves for sales returns and allowances, allowance for credit losses, overhead expenses applied to inventory, inventory reserves, valuation of intangible assets, share based compensation and income taxes. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Results of Operations

 Net Sales Net Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2,327,000 to 44,003,000 as compared to 41,676,000 in the comparable period. Net equipment revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1,474,000 to 22,917,000 as compared to 24,391,000 in the comparable period. The decrease in net equipment sales was primarily due to decreases in intrusion and access alarm products of 233,000 and door locking devices of 1,241,000. Net service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 3,801,000 to 21,086,000 as compared to 17,285,000 in the Comparable period. The increase in net service revenues was primarily due to an increase in our cellular (radio) communication device activations. Gross Profit Overall gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2,203,000 to 24,616,000, or 55.9 of net sales, as compared to 22,413,000, or 53.8 of net sales, for the comparable period. Gross profit from equipment sales was 5,407,000, or 23.6 of equipment sales, as compared to 6,894,000, or 28.3 of net equipment sales, for the comparable period. The decrease in gross profit percentage from equipment sales is primarily a result of product mix. Door locking products historically result in higher margin percentages as compared to access alarm products and specifically cellular (radio) communicator devices, which also result in future increases in recurring alarm communication services revenue. Gross profit on service revenues was 19,209,000, or 91.1 of net service revenues, as compared to 15,519,000, or 89.8 of net service revenues, for the comparable period a year ago. The increase in gross profit percentage was a result of renegotiation of royalty arrangements and volume rebates received from carriers. Research and Development Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 620,000 to 3,057,000, or 6.9 of net sales, as compared to 2,437,000, or 5.8 of net sales, for the comparable period. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily a result of annual compensation increases and hiring of additional resources. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1,282,000 to 9,703,000 as compared to 8,421,000 for the comparable period. The increase in SG A expenses was primarily attributable to compensation increases and hiring of additional staff, increases in advertising and insurance costs, partially offset by decreases in professional fees. Other Income (Expense) Interest and other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 704,000 to income of 1,144,000 as compared to income of 440,000 for the comparable period. The increase in income was primarily due to an increase in interest income on short-term investments as a result of higher interest rates and larger deposit balances. Income Taxes The Company s provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 298,000 to 1,815,000 as compared to 1,517,000 for the same period a year ago. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the three months was primarily due to higher taxable income in the U.S. The Company s effective rate for income tax was 14.0 and 12.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents increased by 20,255,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 was 96,522,000. We believe that our projected cash flow from operations, combined with our cash and short-term investments, will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital requirements, contractual obligations, and other cash flow needs for the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s available revolving credit line was 20,000,000, which expires in February 2029, none of which has been drawn. The Company has no outstanding debt. A summary of the cash flow activity for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was 12.0 million for the period ended September 30, 2024 and was due to net income of 11.2 million and increase in cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities of 1.3 million, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items of .4 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were largely attributable to increases in accounts receivables and decreases in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities was 11.2 million for the period ended September 30, 2023 and was due to net income of 10.5 million and adjustments for non-cash items of 1.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash flow from operating activities due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of 1.0 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities was largely attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in and accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by an increase in inventories. Cash Flows from Investing Activities The net cash provided by investing activities of 15.5 million during the period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the redemption of other investments 16.3 million) partially offset by expenditures used for capital expenditures .7 million) and purchase of investments .1 million). The cash used in investing activities of 0.6 million during the period ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to expenditures used for capital expenditures and purchase of investments. The change in use of cash for investing activities from 2023 to 2024 was a reduction in investments in term deposits (other investments). Cash Flows from Financing Activities The cash used in financing activities of 7.2 million for the period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to the purchase of treasury shares. The cash used in financing activities of 2.9 million for the period ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to the payment of stockholder dividends. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases other than purchase orders issued in the normal course of business. On April 26, 1993, the Company's foreign subsidiary entered into a 99-year land lease of approximately 4 acres of land in the Dominican Republic, on which the Company s principle manufacturing facility is located, at an annual base rent of approximately 235,000 and 105,000 in annual service charges. The service charges increase 2 annually over the remaining life of the lease. ITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio. We internally manage our investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences, and overall financing strategies. Our investment portfolio includes fixed-income securities with a fair value of approximately 5.4 million at June 30, 2024. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and, based on our investment portfolio at June 30, 2024, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately 113,000. While an increase in interest rates may reduce the fair value of the investment portfolio, we will not realize the losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income unless the individual fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other-than-temporary. Currency Exchange Risk We conduct business with non-U.S. customers, however all foreign sales transactions by the Company are denominated in U.S. dollars. As such, the Company has shifted foreign currency exposure onto its foreign customers. If changes in exchange rates were to negatively effect these customers, the Company could have trouble collecting unsecured receivables, and or experience the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders. The foregoing could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk relative to expenses incurred in Dominican Pesos ("RD "), the local currency of the Company's production facility in the Dominican Republic. The result of a 10 strengthening or weakening in the U.S. dollar to the RD would result in an annual increase or decrease in income from operations of approximately 810,000. ITEM 4: Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as of September 30, 2024. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of September 30, 2024, as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed below. Previously Identified Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness in internal control related to inventory costing. The material weakness was a result of ineffective review of information used in the inventory costing process. Plans for Remediation of Material Weaknesses Management, with the oversight of the audit committee of our Board of Directors, is currently designing and implementing reconciliation procedures to determine that the information used in the costing of inventory is complete and accurate and expects to complete these actions during fiscal 2025. While the Company has begun the process of taking measures which it believes will remediate the underlying cause of this material weakness, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully developed and implemented and whether such measures will be effective. Until the Company s remediation plan is fully implemented and effective, the Company will continue to devote time, attention and financial resources to this effort. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting, except for the remediation efforts described above, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting except as described above.
