under current regulations. The Company did not have
any cash in excess of FDIC insured limits at September 30, 2024. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. 

The
carrying value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable are estimated
by management to approximate fair value primarily due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The Company s advances from
related party approximates the fair value of such instruments based upon management s best estimate of interest rates that would
be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

cash equivalents on hand at
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

at September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Operating
lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over
the lease term at commencement date, adjusted by the deferred rent liabilities at the adoption date. As the Company s lease does
not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date
in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes
lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The Company s terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when
it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term. 

The
contracts generally stipulate bi-weekly or monthly billing, and the Company has elected the as invoiced practical expedient
to recognize revenue based on the hours incurred at the contractual rate as the Company has the right to payment in an amount that corresponds
directly with the value of performance completed to date. The Company may also be subject to penalties for violations of certain ethical
standards and non-performance measures within these state contracts. The Company recognizes revenue net of penalties.

, working capital
of and an accumulated deficit of since inception. The Company is too early in its development stage to project
revenue with a necessary level of certainty. Therefore, the Company may not have sufficient funds to sustain its operations for the next
twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements and may need to raise additional cash to fund its operations. These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has commenced sales and
continues to develop its operations. In the event sales do not materialize at the expected rates, management would seek additional financing
or would attempt to conserve cash by further reducing expenses. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving
these objectives. 

The
Company continues to pursue sources of additional capital through debt and financing transactions or arrangements, including equity
financing or other means. The Company may not be successful in identifying suitable funding transactions in a sufficient time period
or at all and may not obtain the required capital by other means. If the Company does not succeed in raising additional capital,
resources may not be sufficient to fund its business. The Company s ability to scale production and distribution capabilities
and further increase the value of its brands, is largely dependent on its success in raising additional capital. From January
through April of 2023, the Company raised a total of 
of capital from the sale of convertible notes. On October 3, 2023, the Company completed its IPO and received net proceeds of
approximately .
In October 2023, the convertible notes were converted into Class A common stock in accordance with the terms of the convertible
promissory notes as a result of the IPO. On September 11, 2024, the Company completed a public offering and received net proceeds of
 . 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. These financial statements also do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
believe that our existing sources of liquidity, along with cash expected to be generated from sales and services, will not be sufficient
to fund our operations, anticipated capital expenditures, working capital and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve
months from the issuance of the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. In the event we are unable to achieve
profitable operations in the near term, we may require additional equity and/or debt financing; however, we cannot provide assurance
that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. We will continue to monitor our expenditures and cash flow
position. 

The
following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities, accumulated deficit and working capital (deficit) at September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023.

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. To date, we have funded our operations through equity and debt financings. Our primary uses of cash have been for
the development of operations, compensation, and professional fees. All funds received have been expended in the furtherance of growing
our business and establishing our services and solutions. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease
in our liquidity over the near to long term: 

A
 substantial increase in working capital requirements to finance our operations; 

Addition
 of administrative and professional personnel as our business continues to grow; 

The
 cost of being a public company; and 

Payments
 for seeking and securing quality staffing personnel. 

Cash
Flow Activities for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Cash
used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2,717,313 and 1,002,026, respectively, which
was primarily attributable to our net loss for the periods.

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,145,808, which consisted of 2,469,150 of proceeds
received from the sale of Class A common stock and warrants, and exercise of Class A common stock warrants, partially offset by 323,342

from related party, 750,397 of repayments on the line of credit and payment off deferred financing costs of 589,059. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions
on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 

The
critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our financial statements
are described below. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
August 28, 2023, we effectuated a 1-for-1.2 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents.
All issued and outstanding shares of common stock and common stock equivalents and per share data have been adjusted in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, on a retrospective basis, to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. Neither the authorized shares
of common stock, nor the par value of the common stock were adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. 

Accounts
Receivable 

Accounts
receivable is carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Accounts receivable is periodically evaluated for collectability based
on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition. We had an allowance of 5,520 at September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

In
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets , all long-lived assets such as property and equipment held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount
by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. 

Leases 

We
account for our leases under ASC 842 - Leases . We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included
in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, current portion of obligations under operating leases, and obligations under
operating leases, non-current on our balance sheets. 

Operating
lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over
the lease term at commencement date, adjusted by the deferred rent liabilities at the adoption date. As our lease does not provide an
implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present
value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial
direct costs incurred. Our terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise
that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

- 9 - 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, the core principle of which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to
receive in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, five basic criteria must be met before revenue can be
recognized: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction
price; (4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy
a performance obligation. 

We
account for revenues when both parties to the contract have approved the contract, the rights and obligations of the parties are identified,
payment terms are identified, and collectability of consideration is probable. Payment terms vary by client and the services offered. 

We
have the following main forms of revenue: 

Healthcare
 Workforce Services 

Behavioral
 and Mental Health Services 

Digital
 Health 

Population
 Health 

Health
 Education 

We
primarily provide our services to state and local government health agencies, payers, and other private health organizations. Healthcare
Workforce, Behavioral and Mental Health and Health Education contracts are accounted for as a single performance obligation satisfied
over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of our medical staffing on an hourly or daily basis.
Population Health and Digital Health contracts generally consist of multiple performance obligations that are distinct, such as to provide
data analytics and reporting, training, or develop technology for implementation and maintenance with the customer. We allocate the transaction
price across the performance obligations based on the estimated fair value of the distinct performance obligations. Depending on the
performance obligation, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains the benefit of the services are provide, or
over time in the case of digital health revenue where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits of the contract, such
as ongoing performance of our technology product. 

The
contracts generally stipulate bi-weekly or monthly billing, and we have elected the as invoiced practical expedient to
recognize revenue based on the hours incurred at the contractual rate as we have the right to payment in an amount that corresponds directly
with the value of performance completed to date. We may also be subject to penalties for violations of certain ethical standards and
non-performance measures within these state contracts. We recognize revenue net of penalties. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides
that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of
the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can
delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We
have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act.
As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions,
including, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and (ii) complying with the requirement adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor s report on financial statements.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total
annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of
the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three
years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

The
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures 
as of September 30, 2024 the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including
its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Effective internal control
contemplates an appropriate level of review to ensure timely preparation and completeness and accuracy of the financial statements and
disclosures. 

Changes
in Internal Control 

Except
as set forth above, there were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 

In
January 2024, a former employee filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court, Southern District
of Indiana. The Company plans to vigorously defend itself against the claims, which it believes are without merit. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

There
have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except the
following: 

Our
Class A common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we fail to comply with continued listing standards. 

If
we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our Class A common stock could be delisted from
The Nasdaq Capital Market. These continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as: 

a
 1.00 minimum closing bid price; 

stockholders 
 equity of 2.5 million; 

500,000
 shares of publicly-held common stock with a market value of at least 1 million; 

300
 round-lot stockholders; and 

compliance
 with Nasdaq s corporate governance requirements, as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the
 exercise of Nasdaq s discretionary authority. 

On
August 13, 2024, 2023, we received written notification (the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, for the last thirty consecutive business days, the market value of our
Class A common stock, had closed below the minimum 35 million requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) (the Minimum Market Value Requirement ). 

On
October 18, 2024, we received a Notice from Nasdaq indicating that the bid price for our Class A common stock, for the last 30 consecutive
business days for the last thirty consecutive business days, had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share and, as a result, we were
not in compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement for the continued listing
on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 

If
we fail to comply with Nasdaq s continued listing standards, we may be delisted and our Class A common stock will trade, if at
all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQX market, and then only if one or more registered broker-dealer
market makers comply with quotation requirements. In addition, delisting of our Class A common stock could depress our stock price, substantially
limit liquidity of our Class A common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or
at all. Finally, delisting of our Class A common stock could result in our Class A common stock becoming a penny stock 
under the Exchange Act.
