 Contract Balances 
 The Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules; accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets include amounts related to the contractual right to consideration for completed performance obligations not yet available to be invoiced. Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received in advance of performance, including amounts which are refundable.

 Total contract assets, net Contract liabilities included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses 
 The amount of revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of the period was million. The Company had no material asset impairment charges related to contract assets in the periods presented. 
 Practical Expedient 
 The Company incurs incremental costs to obtain new contracts across certain of its service lines. As the amortization period of those expenses is 12 months or less, the Company expenses those incremental costs of obtaining the contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 ). 
 Remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate transaction prices for contracts where the performance obligations have not yet been satisfied. In accordance with Topic 606, the Company does not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed and (iii) variable consideration for services performed as a series of daily performance obligations, such as those performed within the Services service line. Performance obligations within such Services contracts represent a significant portion of the Company s contracts with customers not expected to be completed within 12 months.

 billion of the billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Initial Term Loan to January 31, 2030 (the 2030 Tranche-1 ), incurring an additional million in debt transaction costs which were capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining term of the loan. In addition, the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of million within Interest expense, net of interest income, consisting of million in unamortized deferred financing costs and million in certain new transaction costs paid to creditors. The Company also recognized million of new transaction costs directly in Interest expense in the first quarter of 2023. At the time of this amendment, the August 21, 2025 maturity date of the then remaining billion principal balance outstanding under the Initial Term Loan was not changed. 
 On June 21, 2023, the Company amended the 2018 Credit Agreement, effective June 28, 2023, to replace the LIBOR rate applicable to borrowings under the Initial Term Loan with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus an applicable credit spread adjustment. As there were no other material changes to the terms and conditions of the 2018 Credit Agreement, the Company leveraged certain optional expedients for contract modifications related to reference rate reform provided in ASU 2020-04, ASU 2021-01 and ASU 2022-06. 
 On August 24, 2023, the Company amended the 2018 Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of billion of the then-remaining billion aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Initial Term Loan to January 31, 2030 (the 2030 Tranche-2 ), incurring an additional million in debt transaction costs which were capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining term of the loan. In addition, the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of million within Interest expense, net of interest income, consisting of million in unamortized deferred financing costs and million in certain new transaction costs paid to creditors. The Company also recognized million of transaction costs directly in Interest expense in the third quarter of 2023. Upon execution of this amendment, along with the repayment of principal outstanding thereunder using proceeds from the offering of million in senior secured notes (discussed below), the Initial Term Loan had a remaining aggregate principal balance outstanding of million and a maturity date of August 21, 2025. We refer to this remaining aggregate principal balance as the 2025 Tranche, and we refer to the 2025 Tranche, the 2030 Tranche-1 and the 2030 Tranche-2 collectively as the Term Loans . 
 On April 9, 2024, the Company amended the 2018 Credit Agreement to reprice the 2030 Tranche-2, reducing the applicable interest rate from 1-month Term SOFR plus to 1-month Term SOFR plus .

 Payroll Tax Claims 
 In a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the Company is currently engaged in a dispute with a local tax authority about the application of tax rules related to certain payroll taxes with respect to two of our subsidiaries for tax years ended 2015 to 2021. The tax authority has claimed the Company owes unpaid employer payroll tax contributions, plus interest. In addition, we could receive claims for alleged unpaid income taxes as we have been served with protective determinations by the same tax authority. 
 The Company believes that it has appropriately applied the payroll tax rules, including as a result of its consideration of a recent ruling by an appellate court in the jurisdiction, and disagrees with the amounts claimed. However, the Company recorded an immaterial liability as of December 31, 2023 that is equal to the estimated probable loss for the years under review. The Company continues to assess this matter and it is reasonably possible that the matter could result in an additional, potentially material, liability in future periods. There have been no changes to the estimated liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 401(k) Nondiscrimination Testing 
 In 2023, the Company identified irregularities in its historical nondiscrimination testing for a qualified retirement savings plan available to U.S. employees. As of December 31, 2023, to remedy these irregularities, the Company accrued its best estimate of the amount that the Company would need to contribute to the plan in accordance with applicable correction protocols. The amount of the estimated corrective contribution is not material and there have been no material changes to the estimated amount during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Guarantees 
 The Company s guarantees primarily relate to requirements under certain client service contracts and arise through the normal course of business. These guarantees, with certain financial institutions, have both open and closed-ended terms, with remaining closed-ended terms up to years and maximum potential future payments of approximately million in the aggregate. None of these guarantees are individually material to the Company s operating results, financial position or liquidity. The Company considers the future payment or performance related to non-performance under these guarantees to be remote.

The Brokered Loans are currently performing and have not had any material impact on the Greystone JV at this time. The Company will continue to assess this matter and, although it considers the future indemnity obligations related to these Brokered Loans to be remote, it is possible that the matter could result in an additional, potentially material, liability for the Greystone JV in future periods.

 Gain Contingency 
 Subsequent to the completion of our 2014 acquisition of the DTZ Group from UGL Limited UGL ), the Company brought a breach of warranty claim under warranty and indemnity insurance policies obtained in connection with the acquisition to cover certain losses incurred by the Company by reason of warranty breaches by UGL.

 On September 30, 2024, the Company and of the defendant insurers entered into a settlement agreement under which the insurer agreed to pay the Company million in exchange for a release in the Litigation. On October 3, 2024, the amount was paid.

 Earn-out liabilities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the methodology used to develop the estimated fair value includes significant unobservable inputs reflecting management s own assumptions. The fair value of earn-out liabilities is based on the present value of probability-weighted expected return method related to the earn-out performance criteria on each reporting date. The probabilities of achievement assigned to the performance criteria are determined based on due diligence performed at the time of acquisition, as well as actual performance achieved subsequent to acquisition.

 Investments in Real Estate Ventures 
 The Company directly invests in early stage property technology proptech companies, real estate investment funds and other real estate companies across various sectors. The Company typically reports these investments at cost, less impairment charges, and adjusts these investments to fair value if the Company identifies observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar instruments of the same issuer. 
 Investments in early stage proptech companies or other real estate companies are typically fair valued as a result of pricing observed in initial or subsequent funding rounds. These investments are not fair valued on a recurring basis and as such have been excluded from the fair value hierarchy table. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investments in early stage proptech companies had a fair value of approximately million and million, respectively, and are included in Other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Investments in real estate venture capital funds and co-investment funds are primarily fair valued using the net asset value NAV per share (or its equivalent) provided by investees or held at cost, less impairment charges. Critical inputs to NAV estimates include valuations of the underlying real estate assets and borrowings, which incorporate investment-specific assumptions such as discount rates, capitalization rates, rental and expense growth rates, and asset-specific market borrowing rates. As these investments are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy, they have been excluded from the fair value hierarchy table. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investments in real estate venture capital funds and co-investment funds had a fair value of approximately million and million, respectively, and are included in Other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Recent Developments and Outlook 
 Effective January 1, 2024, the Property, facilities and project management service line was renamed to Services. The change was to the name only and had no impact on the composition of the Company s service lines or its historical results. 
 Highlights from the period ended September 30, 2024: 
 Third Quarter Results 
 Revenue of 2.3 billion for the third quarter of 2024 increased 3 from the third quarter of 2023. 
 Leasing grew 13 driven by industrial and office leasing in the Americas and APAC. 
 Valuation and other grew 8 driven by the Americas and EMEA. 
 Services and Capital markets declined 2 and 4 , respectively. 
 Net income of 33.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 increased 67.6 million compared to net loss of 33.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share was 0.14 for the quarter. 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 142.5 million decreased 5 from the third quarter of 2023. 
 On August 1, 2024, we completed the sale of a non-core Services business in the Americas, which resulted in a loss on disposition of 4.5 million and 17.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Year-to-Date Results 
 Revenue of 6.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Strong Leasing growth of 7 was driven by broad strength across all segments, particularly the Americas. 
 Valuation and other grew 2 driven by the Americas and EMEA. 
 Services and Capital markets declined 2 and 7 , respectively. 
 Net income of 18.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 123.6 million compared to net loss of 105.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.08. 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 359.5 million increased 1 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity as of September 30, 2024 was 1.9 billion, consisting of availability on the Company s undrawn Revolver of 1.1 billion and cash and cash equivalents of 0.8 billion. 
 October Debt Activity 
 In October 2024, we elected to prepay the remaining 47.9 million principal balance outstanding under the 2025 Tranche of our Term Loans, bringing our aggregate year-to-date debt repayments, including required principal payments, to 200.4 million. As of the date of this report, there are no funded long-term debt arrangements maturing prior to 2028. Additionally, in October 2024, we repriced the 2030 Tranche-2 of our Term Loans, reducing the applicable interest rate by 50 basis points to 1-month Term SOFR plus 3.25 . 
 Macroeconomic Trends and Uncertainty 
 Demand for our services is largely dependent on the relative strength of the global and regional commercial real estate markets, which are highly sensitive to general macroeconomic conditions and the ability of market participants to access credit and the capital markets. Although borrowing costs have remained elevated, the commercial real estate industry overall has shown signs of improvement, as evidenced by growth in our Leasing revenue, which grew 7 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by strength in the industrial and office sectors. In addition, actions taken by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in September 2024 are expected to improve optimism among real estate owners and investors and could result in more favorable commercial real estate fundamentals and underwriting assumptions.

 Recent Regulatory Developments 
 In March 2024, the SEC issued final rules under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors , which require registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their annual reports. The rules require disclosure of a registrant s material climate-related risks, the risk management processes and governance related to such risks, material climate-related targets and goals, and material Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the rules require disclosure in the notes to the registrant s financial statements of the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions (subject to de minimis thresholds). On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued an order staying the final climate-related disclosure rules pending judicial review of several petitions filed against the SEC challenging the rules validity. Because the SEC stayed the rules before its effective date, if the rules are upheld, their effective date will not be known until subsequently published by the SEC. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, current facts and circumstances, and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness. Although actual amounts may differ from such estimated amounts, we believe such differences are not likely to be material. For additional detail regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to the Company s 2023 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to these policies or estimates as of September 30, 2024. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements within Note 2: New Accounting Pronouncements of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Items Affecting Comparability 
 When reading our financial statements and the information included in this Quarterly Report, it should be considered that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations and could affect future performance. We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are important to understand the variability of our historical earnings and cash flows and any potential future variability. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Our results of operations are significantly impacted by economic trends, government policies and the global and regional real estate markets. These include the following: overall economic activity, volatility of the financial markets, interest rates and inflation, demand for commercial real estate, the impact of tax and regulatory policies, the cost and availability of credit, changes in employment rates and the geopolitical environment. 
 Our diversified operating model helps to partially mitigate the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our margins as a substantial portion of our costs are variable compensation expenses, specifically commissions and bonuses paid to our professionals in our Leasing and Capital markets service lines. Nevertheless, ongoing adverse economic trends could pose significant risks to our operating performance and financial condition. 
 Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 Our results may include the incremental impact of completed transactions, which could impact the comparability of our results on a year-over-year basis. Our results could include incremental revenues and expenses following the completion of an acquisition, or comparable results could include revenues and expenses of recent dispositions. Additionally, there could be an adverse impact on net income for a period of time after the completion of an acquisition driven by transaction-related and integration expenses. From time to time, we use strategic and in-fill acquisitions, as well as joint ventures, to add new service capabilities, to increase our scale within existing capabilities and to expand our presence in new or existing geographic regions globally. As it relates to dispositions, results may include gains or losses on the disposition and we may incur incremental transaction-related costs that could have an adverse impact on net income.

 International Operations 
 Our business consists of service lines operating in multiple regions inside and outside of the U.S. Our international operations expose us to global economic trends, as well as foreign government tax, regulatory and policy measures. 
 Additionally, outside of the U.S., we generate earnings in other currencies and are subject to fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar USD ). These currency fluctuations, most notably the Australian dollar, euro and British pound sterling, have positively and adversely affected our operating results measured in USD in the past and are likely to do so in the future. It can be difficult to compare period-over-period financial statements when the movement in currencies against the USD does not reflect trends in the local underlying business as reported in its local currency. 
 In order to assist our investors and improve comparability of results, we present the year-over-year changes in certain of our non-GAAP financial measures, such as Fee-based operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA, in local currency. The local currency change represents the year-over-year change assuming no movement in foreign exchange rates from the prior year. We believe that this provides our management and investors with a better view of comparability and trends in the underlying operating business. 
 Seasonality 
 A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, especially for service lines such as Leasing and Capital markets. This impacts the comparison of our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Generally, our industry is focused on completing transactions by calendar year-end with a high concentration of activity in the last quarter of the calendar year while certain expenses are recognized more evenly throughout the calendar year. Historically, our revenue and operating income typically tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Our Services revenue partially mitigates this intra-year seasonality, due to the recurring nature of this service line which generates more stable revenues throughout the year. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We have used the following measures, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures under SEC guidelines: 
 i. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin; 
 ii. Segment operating expenses and Fee-based operating expenses; and 
 iii. Local currency. 
 Management principally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance, develop budgets and forecasts, improve comparability of results and assist our investors in analyzing the underlying performance of our business. These measures are not recognized measurements under GAAP. When analyzing our operating results, investors should use them in addition to, but not as an alternative for, the most directly comparable financial results calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because the Company s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 The Company believes that these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance. The measures eliminate the impact of certain items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. The Company believes that they are useful to investors for the additional purposes described below. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin: We have determined Adjusted EBITDA to be our primary measure of segment profitability. We believe that investors find this measure useful in comparing our operating performance to that of other companies in our industry because these calculations generally eliminate unrealized (gain) loss on investments, net, loss on dispositions, integration and other costs related to merger, acquisition related costs and efficiency initiatives, cost savings initiatives, CEO transition costs, servicing liability fees and amortization, certain legal and compliance matters, gains from insurance proceeds and other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the effects of financings, income tax and the non-cash accounting effects of depreciation and intangible asset amortization. Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure of profitability as a percent of revenue, is measured against service line fee revenue.

 Segment operating expenses and Fee-based operating expenses: Consistent with GAAP, reimbursed costs for certain customer contracts are presented on a gross basis in both revenue and operating expenses for which the Company recognizes substantially no margin. Total costs and expenses include segment operating expenses, as well as other expenses such as depreciation and amortization, loss on dispositions, integration and other costs related to merger, acquisition related costs and efficiency initiatives, cost savings initiatives, CEO transition costs, servicing liability fees and amortization, certain legal and compliance matters and other non-recurring items. Segment operating expenses includes Fee-based operating expenses and Cost of gross contract reimbursables. We believe Fee-based operating expenses more accurately reflects the costs we incur during the course of delivering services to our clients and is more consistent with how we manage our expense base and operating margins. 
 Local currency: In discussing our results, we refer to percentage changes in local currency. These metrics are calculated by holding foreign currency exchange rates constant in year-over-year comparisons. Management believes that this methodology provides investors with greater visibility into the performance of our business excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. 
 Adjustments to U.S. GAAP Financial Measures Used to Calculate Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 During the periods presented in this Quarterly Report, we had the following adjustments: 
 Unrealized (gain) loss on investments, net represents net unrealized gains and losses on fair value investments. Prior to 2024, this primarily reflected unrealized losses on our investment in WeWork. 
 Loss on dispositions reflects losses on the sale or disposition of businesses as well as other transaction costs associated with the sales, which are not indicative of our core operating results given the low frequency of business dispositions by the Company. 
 Integration and other costs related to merger reflects the non-cash amortization expense of certain merger related retention awards that will be amortized through 2026, and the non-cash amortization expense of merger related deferred rent and tenant incentives which will be amortized through 2028. 
 Acquisition related costs and efficiency initiatives includes internal and external consulting costs incurred to implement certain distinct operating efficiency initiatives designed to realign our organization to be a more agile partner to our clients. These initiatives vary in frequency, amount and occurrence based on factors specific to each initiative. In addition, this includes certain direct costs incurred in connection with acquiring businesses. 
 Cost savings initiatives primarily reflects severance and other one-time employment-related separation costs related to actions to reduce headcount across select roles to help optimize our workforce given the challenging macroeconomic conditions and operating environment, as well as property lease rationalizations. These actions continued through September 30, 2024. 
 CEO transition costs in 2024 reflects certain payroll taxes associated with compensation for John Forrester, the Company s former Chief Executive Officer CEO ). In 2023, CEO transition costs reflects accelerated stock-based compensation expense associated with stock awards granted to Mr. Forrester, who stepped down from the position of CEO as of June 30, 2023, but who remained employed by the Company as a Strategic Advisor until December 31, 2023. The requisite service period under the applicable award agreements was satisfied upon Mr. Forrester s retirement from the Company on December 31, 2023. In 2023, CEO transition costs also included Mr. Forrester s salary and bonus accruals for the third quarter of 2023. We believe the accelerated stock-based compensation expense, salary and bonus accruals, as well as the payroll taxes associated with such compensation, are similar in nature to one-time severance benefits and are not normal, recurring operating expenses necessary to operate the business. 
 Servicing liability fees and amortization reflects the additional non-cash servicing liability fees accrued in connection with the A/R Securitization amendments in prior years. The liability will be amortized through June 2026. 
 Legal and compliance matters includes estimated losses and settlements for certain legal matters which are not considered ordinary course legal matters given the infrequency of similar cases brought against the Company, complexity of the matter, nature of the remedies sought and/or our overall litigation strategy. We exclude such losses from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to improve the comparability of our operating results for the current period to prior and future periods. 
 Gains from insurance proceeds represents one-time gains related to certain contingent events, such as insurance recoveries, which are not considered ordinary course and which are only recorded once realized or realizable, net of related legal fees. We exclude such net gains from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to improve the comparability of our operating results for the current period to prior and future periods.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue of 2.3 billion increased 58.2 million or 3 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by Leasing revenue growth of 13 , with strength in the Americas and APAC. In the Americas, Leasing revenue grew 16 primarily driven by strong office and industrial revenue as a result of improved business optimism. In addition, Valuation and other revenue increased 8 . Partially offsetting these trends was a 4 decline in Capital markets revenue, primarily driven by APAC, as volatility and uncertainty in the interest rate environment continued to challenge investment sales activity. Services revenue declined 2 and Gross contract reimbursables increased 2 due to changes in client mix and the sale of a non-core Services business on August 1, 2024. 
 Costs of services 
 Costs of services of 1.9 billion increased 29.7 million or 2 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, principally driven by an increase in employment costs of approximately 83.0 million including higher commissions as a result of higher Leasing revenue, partially offset by declines in third-party consumables and sub-contractor costs of approximately 40.0 million, as a result of lower Services revenue. Cost of services provided to clients increased 1 and Cost of gross contract reimbursables increased 2 . 
 Operating, administrative and other 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses of 314.2 million increased 13.3 million or 4 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by higher employment costs due to the timing of incentive compensation accrual adjustments in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by our cost savings initiatives. 
 Restructuring, impairment and related charges 
 Restructuring, impairment and related charges of 14.1 million increased 4.9 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an additional 4.5 million loss on disposition recognized in the third quarter of 2024 related to the sale of a non-core Services business in the Americas. 
 Interest expense, net of interest income 
 Interest expense of 54.9 million decreased 34.6 million or 39 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to a loss on debt extinguishment of 25.0 million as well as 4.0 million of new transaction costs expensed in the third quarter of 2023 in connection with the refinancing of a portion of the borrowings under our 2018 Credit Agreement (see Note 10: Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowings in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). The decrease in interest expense was also partially driven by lower variable interest rates on our Term Loans compared to the prior year period. 
 Earnings from equity method investments 
 Earnings from equity method investments of 12.1 million decreased 4.5 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decline in earnings recognized from our equity method investment Cushman Wakefield Greystone LLC (the Greystone JV due to lower transaction volumes as a result of tighter lending conditions given the volatility in interest rates. 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Other income, net was 20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other expense, net of 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a 17.3 million gain from insurance proceeds recognized in the third quarter of 2024 (see Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information), as well as lower net unrealized losses on our fair value investments, primarily related to our investment in WeWork. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 Provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 was 19.3 million on earnings before income taxes of 53.0 million. For the third quarter of 2023, the provision for income taxes was 16.6 million on loss before income taxes of 17.3 million. The increase in income tax expense compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by higher earnings before income taxes and changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings resulting in higher non-deductible losses when compared to the same period in 2023.

 Net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Net income was 33.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss of 33.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income margin was 1.4 compared to net loss margin of 1.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 67.6 million increase in net income was driven by growth in our Leasing service line, the impact of our cost savings initiatives, a one-time gain from insurance proceeds and lower losses on our fair value investments. Additionally, a loss on debt extinguishment incurred in 2023 contributed to the improvement from the prior year period. These favorable trends were partially offset by declines in our Services and Capital markets service lines, higher incentive compensation and the loss on disposition recognized in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 142.5 million decreased 7.5 million or 5 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the same factors impacting Net income above, with the exception of the gain from insurance proceeds, net unrealized losses on our fair value investments, loss on disposition and loss on debt extinguishment incurred in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin, measured against service line fee revenue, of 8.7 declined 72 basis points from the third quarter of 2023. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue of 6.8 billion decreased 124.3 million or 2 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the Americas and EMEA which decreased 3 and 3 , respectively, partially offset by growth in APAC of 7 . This decline was principally driven by decreases in Services and Gross contract reimbursables revenue of 2 and 5 , respectively, due to changes in client mix. Capital markets revenue declined 7 , driven by a 9 decline in the Americas, as volatility and uncertainty in the interest rate environment continued to challenge investment sales activity in the first half of 2024. Partially offsetting these trends was 7 growth in Leasing revenue compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by broad strength across all segments, primarily within the industrial and office sectors. Valuation and other revenue also increased 2 . 
 Costs of services 
 Costs of services of 5.6 billion decreased 148.7 million or 3 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, principally driven by a decrease in third-party consumables and sub-contractor costs of approximately 189.0 million, partially offset by an increase in employment costs of approximately 52.0 million. Cost of services provided to clients decreased 1 and Cost of gross contract reimbursables decreased 5 , driven by the Americas, due to changes in client mix. Total costs of services as a percentage of total revenue was 82 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating, administrative and other 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses of 904.4 million decreased 41.3 million or 4 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the impact of our cost savings initiatives, primarily realized as a reduction in employment costs. In addition, during June 2023, the Company incurred an 11.3 million servicing liability fee in connection with the amendment and extension of the A/R Securitization. Operating, administrative and other expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Restructuring, impairment and related charges 
 Restructuring, impairment and related charges of 36.5 million increased 13.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by a loss on disposition of 17.0 million related to the sale of a non-core Services business in the Americas, partially offset by a decrease in severance and employment-related costs of 3.2 million. In 2023, the Company actioned certain cost savings initiatives, including a reduction in headcount across select roles to help optimize our workforce given the challenging macroeconomic conditions and operating environment, as well as property lease rationalizations. These actions continued through September 30, 2024. 
 Interest expense, net of interest income 
 Interest expense of 174.4 million decreased 49.8 million or 22 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to an aggregate loss on debt extinguishment of 41.9 million as well as 8.7 million of new transaction costs expensed in 2023 in connection with the refinancing of a portion of the borrowings under our 2018 Credit Agreement (see Note 10: Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowings in the Notes to the Condensed

 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by higher variable interest rates on our Term Loans compared to the prior year period. 
 Earnings from equity method investments 
 Earnings from equity method investments of 28.1 million decreased 13.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decline of 13.6 million in earnings recognized from the Greystone JV due to lower transaction volumes as a result of tighter lending conditions given the volatility in interest rates. 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Other income, net was 25.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other expense, net of 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a 17.3 million gain from insurance proceeds recognized in the third quarter of 2024 (see Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information), as well as lower net unrealized losses on our fair value investments, primarily related to our investment in WeWork. These trends were partially offset by lower royalty fee income. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 Provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.3 million on earnings before income taxes of 43.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the provision for income taxes was 5.1 million on a loss before income taxes of 100.1 million. The increase in income tax expense was driven by an increase in earnings before income taxes and changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings resulting in higher non-deductible losses when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA 
 Net income was 18.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss of 105.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income margin was 0.3 compared to net loss margin of 1.5 for the prior year period. The improvement was driven by the impact of our cost savings initiatives, including lower employment costs, growth in our Leasing service line, a one-time gain from insurance proceeds and lower net unrealized losses on our fair value investments. Additionally, an aggregate loss on debt extinguishment and a servicing liability fee associated with the amendment and extension of the A/R Securitization in 2023 contributed to the improvement from the prior year period. These favorable trends were partially offset by declines in our Services and Capital markets service lines and the loss on disposition recognized in 2024. 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 359.5 million increased 2.5 million or 1 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the same factors impacting Net income above, with the exception of the gain from insurance proceeds, net unrealized losses on our fair value investments, loss on disposition and the aggregate loss on debt extinguishment and A/R Securitization servicing liability fee incurred in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin, measured against service line fee revenue, of 7.6 remained unchanged from the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Americas: Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Americas revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was 1.8 billion, an increase of 48.6 million or 3 from the third quarter of 2023. This increase was principally driven by higher Leasing revenue which was up 16 , primarily due to higher tenant representation revenue as a result of more favorable market conditions than the third quarter of 2023. In addition, Valuation and other and Capital markets revenue increased by 24 and 2 , respectively, reflecting improved business confidence. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in Services and Gross contract reimbursables revenue of 1 and 2 , respectively, primarily as a result of the sale of a non-core Services business on August 1, 2024. 
 Fee-based operating expenses of 1.1 billion increased 5 principally due to higher commissions associated with revenue increases in Leasing and higher employment costs due to the timing of incentive compensation accrual adjustments in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by lower sub-contractor and third-party consumable costs associated with revenue decreases in Services. 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 111.3 million decreased 6.1 million or 5 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the impact of the sale of a non-core Services business in the third quarter of 2024, higher employment costs due to the timing of incentive compensation accrual adjustments in the third quarter of 2023, and lower earnings recognized from the Greystone JV. These trends were partially offset by growth in our Leasing, Capital markets and Valuation and other service lines.

 Americas: Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Americas revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.1 billion, a decrease of 173.9 million or 3 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decline was principally driven by lower Services and Gross contract reimbursables revenue which were down 3 and 8 , respectively, primarily due to declines in facilities management, including as a result of the sale of a non-core Services business in the third quarter of 2024, facilities services and changes in client mix. In addition, volatility and uncertainty in the interest rate environment continued to challenge investment sales activity resulting in a decline in Capital markets revenue of 9 . Partially offsetting these declines was growth in Leasing and Valuation and other revenue of 7 and 10 , respectively. 
 Fee-based operating expenses of 3.1 billion decreased 1 principally due to lower sub-contractor and third-party consumable costs associated with revenue decreases in Services, as well as the impact of our cost savings initiatives. 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 284.7 million decreased 5.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by declines in our Services and Capital markets service lines, the impact of the sale of a non-core Services business in the third quarter of 2024 and lower earnings recognized from the Greystone JV. These trends were partially offset by the impact of our cost savings initiatives and growth in our Leasing and Valuation and other service lines.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves, debt capacity under our Revolver and funding from our A/R Securitization. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses, acquisitions, investments and debt payments. 
 While macroeconomic challenges and uncertainty continue to be present, we believe that we have maintained sufficient liquidity to satisfy our working capital and other funding requirements, including capital expenditures, and expenditures for human capital and contractual obligations, with operating cash flow and cash on hand and, as necessary, borrowings under our Revolver or funding from our A/R Securitization. We continually evaluate opportunities to obtain, retire or restructure our debt, credit facilities or financing arrangements for strategic reasons or to obtain additional financing to fund investments, operations and obligations to further strengthen our financial position. 
 We have historically relied on our operating cash flow to fund our working capital needs and ongoing capital expenditures on an annual basis. Our operating cash flow is seasonal typically lowest in the first quarter of the year, when revenue is lowest, and greatest in the fourth quarter of the year, when revenue is highest. The seasonal nature of our operating cash flow can result in a mismatch with funding needs, which we manage using available cash on hand and, as necessary, borrowings under our Revolver or funding from our A/R Securitization. 
 In the absence of a large strategic acquisition or other extraordinary events, we believe our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and availability under our Revolver will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. We may seek to take advantage of opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we consider attractive. 
 In October 2024, we elected to prepay the remaining 47.9 million principal balance outstanding under the 2025 Tranche of our Term Loans, bringing our aggregate year-to-date debt repayments, including required principal payments, to 200.4 million. As of the date of this report, there are no further long-term debt arrangements maturing prior to 2028. Additionally, in October 2024, we repriced the 2030 Tranche-2 of our Term Loans, reducing the applicable interest rate by 50 basis points to 1-month Term SOFR plus 3.25 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 1.9 billion of liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 0.8 billion and availability on our undrawn Revolver of 1.1 billion. 
 As a professional services firm, funding our operating activities is not capital intensive. Total capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 31.7 million. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company is party to an off-balance sheet revolving A/R Securitization, whereby we continuously sell eligible trade receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution. Receivables are derecognized from our balance sheet upon sale, for which we receive cash payment and record a deferred purchase price receivable which is realized after collection of the underlying receivables. This program also provides funding from a committed purchaser against receivables sold into the program with a maximum facility limit of 200.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had aggregate capital outstanding under this facility of 125.0 million. This amount was repaid in full in October 2024. The A/R Securitization expires on June 19, 2026, unless extended or an earlier termination event occurs. Refer to Note 14: Accounts Receivable Securitization of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 Cash Flow Summary 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Cash Flow Summary 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 92.8 (50.2) Net cash provided by investing activities 
 114.3 80.2 Net cash used in financing activities 
 (197.5) (107.1) Effects of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 2.1 (6.6) Total change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 11.7 (83.7) 
 Operating Activities 
 We generated 92.8 million of cash from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 143.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used net working capital for operations of 69.9 million, a decrease of 154.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction in our use of net working capital was principally driven by lower bonus accruals and lower income taxes payable, partially offset by lower trade receivables. In addition, the improvement in cash flows from operating activities was driven by a 123.6 million increase from net loss to net income. 
 Investing Activities 
 We generated 114.3 million of cash from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 34.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of a non-core Services business in the third quarter of 2024 of 121.4 million, offset by a decrease in the net capital funding from the facility limit secured by our A/R Securitization of 95.0 million and lower investments in equity securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 We used 197.5 million of cash in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 90.4 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by repayment of borrowings under our 2018 Credit Agreement of 150.0 million, partially offset by payment of debt issuance costs of 65.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market and Other Risk Factors 
 Market Risk 
 The principal market risks we are exposed to are: 
 i. interest rates on debt obligations; and 
 ii. foreign exchange risk. 
 We manage these risks primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of our debt funding and by using various derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or foreign currency contracts. We enter into derivative instruments with trusted and diverse counterparties to reduce credit risk. These derivative instruments are strictly used for risk management purposes and, accordingly, are not used for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to the Term Loans and any borrowings we draw under the Revolver. 
 The Term Loans bear interest at a variable rate that the Company may select per the terms of the 2018 Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we elected to use an annual rate equal to (i) 1-month Term SOFR, plus 0.11 (which sum is subject to a minimum floor of 0.00 ), plus 2.75 for the 2025 Tranche, (ii) 1-month Term SOFR (subject to a minimum floor of 0.50 ), plus 3.00 for the 2030 Tranche-1 and (iii) 1-month Term SOFR (subject to a minimum floor of 0.50 ), plus 3.75 for the 2030 Tranche-2. In October 2024, we repriced the 2030 
 
 43 

T able of Contents 

 Tranche-2, reducing the applicable interest rate by 50 basis points to 1-month Term SOFR plus 3.25 . Our 2028 Notes and 2031 Notes bear interest at annual fixed rates of 6.75 and 8.88 , respectively. 
 We manage this interest rate risk by entering into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments driven by fluctuations in interest rates. We continually assess interest rate sensitivity to estimate the impact of changes in short-term interest rates on our variable rate debt. Our interest rate risk management strategy is focused on limiting the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows to lower our overall borrowing costs. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 Our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of USD, our reporting currency. Refer to the discussion of international operations included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further detail. 
 Our foreign exchange risk management strategy is achieved by establishing local operations in the markets that we serve, invoicing customers in the same currency in which costs are incurred and the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts. Translating expenses incurred in foreign currencies into USD offsets the impact of translating revenue earned in foreign currencies into USD. We enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage currency risks associated with intercompany transactions and cash management. 
 Refer to Note 9: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about interest rate and foreign currency risks managed through derivative activities and notional amounts of underlying hedged items. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), require that we conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. This evaluation is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosures are complete and accurate in all material respects. The evaluation is further designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer supervise and participate in this evaluation, and they are assisted by other members of our Disclosure Committee. 
 We conducted the required evaluation, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective as of September 30, 2024 to accomplish their objectives with reasonable assurance. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
