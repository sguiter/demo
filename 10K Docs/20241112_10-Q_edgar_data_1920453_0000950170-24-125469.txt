CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are current expectations, estimates and projections of Fidelity Private Credit Fund (the Fund, we, us or our and/or Fidelity Diversifying Solutions LLC FDS or the Adviser about the Fund, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, seek, expect, anticipate, project, estimate, intend, continue, target, or believe or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Due to various risks and uncertainties, actual events or results or the actual performance of the Fund may differ materially from those reflected or contemplated in such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

our ability to raise capital; 

geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war, including those arising out of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our current and expected financing arrangements and investments; 

changes in the general interest rate environment; 

the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 

the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Adviser and its affiliates; 

the elevating levels of inflation, and its impact on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we invest; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we may invest; 

the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments; 

the ability of the Adviser to identify suitable investments and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of the Adviser and its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

our ability to maintain our qualification as a business development company BDC and as a regulated investment company RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; 

the impact on our business of U.S. and international financial reform legislation, rules and regulations; 

the effect of changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations thereof; and 

the tax status of the enterprises in which we may invest. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future file with the SEC including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Because we are an investment company, the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this report are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act, as amended (the 1934 Act ).

 of its total assets in investments that meet regulatory requirements of the BDC structure, which will generally include investments in companies that are private and may be backed by a sponsor but may also include investments in small capitalization public companies or companies that are backed by a non-private equity sponsor ownership group. The majority of the Fund s investments will be loans targeted at private U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and public U.S. operating companies having a market capitalization of less than 250,000,000. The Fund may also invest to a lesser degree in non-U.S. companies. The Fund offers on a continuous basis up to of common shares of beneficial interest (the Common Shares pursuant to an offering registered with the SEC (the Offering ). The Fund offers to sell any combination of three classes of Common Shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, and Class I shares, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different ongoing distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees. The initial offering price for the Common Shares was per share. Thereafter, the purchase price per share for each class of Common Shares equals the net asset value NAV per share as of the effective date of the monthly share purchase date.

and which are included in other accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, recognized a total provision for taxes of and , respectively, which was comprised of provision for taxes related to income of and , respectively, provision for taxes related to realized gain on investments of and , respectively, and benefit for deferred tax expense of and provision for deferred tax expense of , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Fund did t recognize any provisions for taxes. The Fund files a U.S. federal income tax return, in addition to state and local tax returns as required. The Fund s U.S. federal income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for a period of three fiscal years after they are filed. State and local tax returns may be subject to examination for an additional fiscal year depending on the jurisdiction. To qualify for and maintain qualification as a RIC, the Fund must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, the Fund must distribute to its shareholders, for each taxable year, at least of its investment company taxable income for that year, which is generally its ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of its realized net short-term capital gains over its realized net long-term capital losses. In addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible U.S federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Fund distributes in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Fund that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , and , respectively, was recorded in excise tax payable on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the period from March 13, 2023 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2023 , the Fund did t incur any excise taxes. Excise taxes, if any, are recorded in the provision for income and excise taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.

For purposes of the Advisory Agreement, net assets mean the Fund s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. For the first calendar month in which the Fund had operations, net assets was measured as the beginning net assets as of the date on which the Fund broke escrow, which was March 13, 2023. Fees payable for any partial period are appropriately prorated. The Adviser agreed to waive the management fee for the first six months following the date on which the Fund broke escrow, which occurred on March 13, 2023. On August 9, 2023, the Adviser agreed to extend the waiver of the Fund's management fee until December 31, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management fees were and , respectively, and there were management fees waived. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, management fees were and , respectively. All management fees incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were voluntarily waived by the Adviser. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, were payable to the Adviser for management fees. Incentive Fees The incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Fund s income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Fund s capital gains, each as described below. Incentive Fee based on Income The incentive fee based on the Fund s income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns attributable to each class of the Fund s Common Shares. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means dividends, cash interest or other distributions or other cash income and any third-party fees received from portfolio companies such as upfront fees, commitment fees, origination fees, amendment fees, ticking fees and break-up fees, as well as prepayment premiums, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance and fees earned by the Adviser or an affiliate accrued during the month, minus operating expenses for the month (including the management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Advisory Agreement and an administration agreement with the Fund s administrator, any expense of securitizations, and interest expense or other financing fees and any dividends paid on preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and shareholder servicing and /or distribution fees). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with payment-in-kind PIK interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income that the Fund has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The impact of expense support payments and recoupments are also excluded from Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of per quarter (5.00 annualized). 

 35 

100 of the dollar amount of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns attributable to the applicable share class, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). This portion of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.43 is referred to as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately 12.5 of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 1.43 in any calendar quarter; and 

 12.5 of the dollar amount of the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns attributable to the applicable share class, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 12.5 of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser. 

 These calculations are pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. The Adviser agreed to waive the incentive fee based on income for the first six months following the date on which the Fund broke escrow, which occurred on March 13, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, incentive fees based on income were and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, incentive fees based on income were and , respectively. All incentive fees based on income incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were voluntarily waived by the Adviser. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, were payable to the Adviser for incentive fees based on income. Incentive Fee based on Capital Gains The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable equals of cumulative realized capital gains attributable to the applicable share class from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. US GAAP requires that the incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized appreciation of investments in the calculation, as an incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Advisory Agreement (the GAAP Incentive Fee ). There can be no assurance that such unrealized appreciation will be realized in the future. Accordingly, such fee, as calculated and accrued, would not necessarily be payable under the Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of incentive fees in subsequent periods. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and , respectively, of expense reversals were recognized related to the GAAP Incentive Fee and is recorded in capital gains incentive fees on the consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and , respectively, of expense was recognized related to the GAAP Incentive Fee and is recorded in capital gains incentive fees on the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, related to the GAAP Incentive Fee is recorded in capital gains incentive fee payable on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, none of which is payable under the Advisory Agreement. 

 36 

The fee paid to the Administrator is an expense paid out of the Fund s net assets and is computed based on the value of the net assets of the Fund as of the close of business on the last business day of each month (including any assets in respect of Common Shares that are repurchased as of the end of the quarter). From time to time, FDS (in its capacity as both the Adviser and the Administrator) or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. Unless such expenses are specifically assumed by the Adviser, Administrator or its affiliates under the Advisory Agreement or Administration Agreement, the Fund will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on the Fund s behalf. From time to time, the Adviser or the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. Costs and expenses of FDS in its capacity as both the Administrator and the Adviser that are eligible for reimbursement by the Fund will be reasonably allocated to the Fund on the basis of time spent, assets under management, usage rates, proportionate holdings, a combination thereof or other reasonable methods determined by the Administrator. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund incurred and , respectively, in expenses under the Administration Agreement, which were recorded as Administration Fees on the consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Fund incurred and , respectively, in expenses under the Administration Agreement, pro-rated for the period March 13 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2023, which were recorded as Administration Fees on the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, was unpaid and included in due to affiliates, net in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, was unpaid and included in due from affiliates, net in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Certain Terms of the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement Each of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement has been approved by the Board. Unless earlier terminated as described below, each of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from the date it first becomes effective and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of the Fund s outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the Independent Trustees. 

 37 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund incurred and , respectively, for transfer agency services which were recorded in other general and administrative expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Fund incurred and , respectively, of fees for transfer agency services, pro-rated for the period March 13 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2023, and were recorded in other general and administrative expenses.

As of December 31, 2023, was unpaid and included in due from affiliates, net in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Managing Dealer Agreement The Fund has entered into a Managing Dealer Agreement (the Managing Dealer Agreement with Fidelity Distributors Company LLC (the Managing Dealer ). Under the terms of the Managing Dealer Agreement, the Managing Dealer will serve as the managing dealer for the Offering. No shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be paid with respect to Class I. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be paid monthly in arrears. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be payable to the Managing Dealer, but the Managing Dealer will reallow (pay) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers and will waive shareholder servicing fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. The Managing Dealer will cease receiving the distribution and/or shareholder servicing fee on Class S shares and Class D shares upon the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a listing of Class I shares, (ii) the merger or consolidation of the Fund with or into another entity, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Fund s assets, or (iii) the date following the completion of the primary portion of the Offering on which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources in connection with such Offering is equal to 10 of the gross proceeds from our primary shares sold in such Offering, as determined in good faith by the Managing Dealer in its sole discretion. In addition, at the end of the month in which the Managing Dealer in conjunction with the transfer agent determines that total transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, and shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees paid with respect to any single share held in a shareholder s account would exceed, in the aggregate, 10 of the gross proceeds from the sale of such share (or a lower limit as determined by the Managing Dealer or the applicable broker), the Managing Dealer shall cease receiving the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee on either (i) each such share that would exceed such limit or (ii) all Common Shares in such shareholder s account, in the Managing Dealer s discretion. At the end of such month, the applicable Distribution Shares in such shareholder s account will convert into a number of Class I shares (including any fractional shares), with an equivalent aggregate NAV. 

 38 

Class D shares 

Class I shares 

The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees is paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the NAV of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month, subject to FINRA and other limitations on underwriting compensation. The Managing Dealer will reallow (pay) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers, and will waive shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. Because the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to Class S shares and Class D shares are calculated based on the aggregate NAV for all of the outstanding shares of each such class, it reduces the NAV with respect to all shares of each such class, including shares issued under our distribution reinvestment plan. Eligibility to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee is conditioned on a broker providing the following ongoing services with respect to the Class S or Class D shares: assistance with recordkeeping, answering investor inquiries regarding us, including regarding distribution payments and reinvestments, helping investors understand their investments upon their request, and assistance with share repurchase requests. If the applicable broker is not eligible to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee due to failure to provide these services, the Managing Dealer will waive the shareholder servicing fee and/or distribution that broker would have otherwise been eligible to receive. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are ongoing fees that are not paid at the time of purchase. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund incurred distribution and shareholder servicing fees for Class S of and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Fund incurred distribution and shareholder servicing fees for Class D of and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Fund did not incur any distribution and shareholder servicing fees for Class S and Class D. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there was an d , respectively, payable and recorded in due to affiliates, net and shareholder servicing fee payable, respectively, in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Affiliate Ownership As of September 30, 2024, an affiliate of the Adviser h eld shares and shares of the Fund s Class D Common Shares and Class S Common Shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, an affiliate of the Adviser held shares and shares of the Fund s Class D Common Shares and Class S Common Shares, respectively.

Any Required Expense Payment must be paid by the Adviser to the Fund in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds and/or offset against amounts due from the Fund to the Adviser or its affiliates. Other Operating Expenses means the Fund s organization and offering expenses, professional fees (including accounting, legal, and auditing fees), custodian and transfer agent fees, third party valuation agent fees, insurance costs, trustee fees, administration fees, and other general and administrative expenses. Upon the termination of Adviser s obligation to make Required Expense Payments, the Adviser may elect to pay, at such times as the Adviser determines, certain expenses on the Fund s behalf, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense or distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees of the Fund (referred to as Voluntary Expense Payment and together with a Required Expense Payment, the Expense Payments ). Any Voluntary Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Fund in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than 45 days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from the Fund to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar month in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Fund s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar month (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), the Fund shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Fund within 3 years prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Fund shall be referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Fund s net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) the Fund s net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to the Fund on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). No Reimbursement Payment for any month shall be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share declared by the Fund at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, (2) the Fund s Operating Expense Ratio at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relate, or (3) the Fund s Other Operating Expenses at the time of such Reimbursement Payment exceeds of the Fund s NAV. Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365-day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and shareholder servicing fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing Operating Expenses, less organizational and offering expenses, management and incentive fees owed to the Adviser, shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, and interest expense, by the Fund s net assets. Operating Expenses means all of the Fund s operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies. The Fund s obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment shall automatically become a liability of the Fund on the last business day of the applicable calendar month, except to the extent the Adviser has waived its right to receive such payment for the applicable month. Effective from the date the Fund broke escrow, which was March 13, 2023, FDS has voluntarily agreed to waive its right to receive any Reimbursement Payment for any Excess Operating Funds incurred in any month prior to a revocation. Any such amounts shall not be considered unreimbursed Expense Payments reimbursable in future months pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. This voluntary arrangement can be terminated at any time, upon thirty days prior written notice to the Fund.

Share Repurchase Program At the discretion of the Board, the Fund has commenced a share repurchase program in which the Fund may repurchase, in each quarter, up to of the NAV of the Fund s Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the Fund s best interest and the best interest of the Fund s shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. The Fund expects to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers each quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived, at the Fund s discretion, in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Fund for the benefit of remaining shareholders. The Fund intends to conduct the repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by the Fund pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares.

The Fund is externally managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, determining the value of Fund investments, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. The Fund elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company RIC as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). 
 An externally-managed BDC generally does not have any employees, and its investment and management functions are provided by an outside investment adviser and administrator under an advisory agreement and administration agreement. Instead of directly compensating employees, we pay FDS for investment and management services pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. The Fund is a non-exchange traded, perpetual-life BDC, which is a BDC whose shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. The Fund uses the term perpetual-life BDC to describe an investment vehicle of indefinite duration, whose shares of common stock are intended to be sold by the Fund on a continuous basis at a price generally equal to the Fund s NAV per share. 

Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 The Fund focuses primarily on directly originated loans to private companies but will also invest in liquid credit investments, such as broadly syndicated loans. Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, trading prices of loans and other securities and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 The Fund generates revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments bear interest predominantly at a floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. Original issue discounts OIDs and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 57 

Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. The Administrator or its affiliates will bear all fees, costs, and expenses incurred that are not specifically assumed by the Fund under the Administration Agreement. 
 From time to time, FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and Administrator) or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser or Administrator) or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and Administrator) may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders, subject to the cap on Other Operating Expenses described below. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 The Fund entered into an Expense Support Agreement with our Adviser. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, for the twelve month period commencing the date of Agreement, September 23, 2022, and unless terminated, for each successive one year period, the Adviser is obligated to advance all of our Other Operating Expenses (including organizational and offering expenses) to the effect that such expenses do not exceed 0.70 (on an annualized basis) of the Fund s NAV. We will be obligated to reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses only if certain conditions are met. Any reimbursements will not exceed actual expenses incurred by the Adviser and its affiliates. 
 As of March 13 (commencement of operations), 2023, FDS voluntarily agreed to waive its right to receive any Reimbursement Payment for any Excess Operating Funds incurred in any month prior to a revocation. Any such amounts shall not be considered unreimbursed Expense Payments reimbursable in future months pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. This voluntary arrangement can be terminated at any time, upon thirty days prior written notice to the Fund. For additional information, see Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Related Party Agreements and Transactions. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired 859.1 million aggregate principal amount of investments (including 134.8 million of unfunded commitments).

The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company s industry; and 

review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 

As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 
 1 The portfolio investment is performing above our underwriting expectations. 
 2 The portfolio investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting. As a general rule, new investments are initially rated a 2. 
 3 The portfolio investment is operating below our underwriting expectations and requires closer monitoring. The company may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, principal or interest payments are generally not past due. 
 4 The portfolio investment is performing materially below our underwriting expectations and returns on our investment are likely to be impaired. Principal or interest payments may be past due, however, full recovery of principal and interest payments are expected. 
 5 The portfolio investment is performing significantly below expectations and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. The company is in payment default and the principal and interest payments are not expected to be repaid in full. 
 The following table shows the composition of our debt portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income was 31.7 million and 77.4 million, respectively, driven by the combination of continued deployment and the performance of our investment portfolio. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value was 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and our weighted average yield on debt, at fair value, was 10.35 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, total investment income was 8.3 million and 13.5 million, respectively, driven by our deployment of capital during the year. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value was 341.5 million at September 30, 2023 and our weighted average yield on debt, at fair value, was 11.45 . 
 The interest rate environment was stable for most of the quarter, as evidenced by SOFR remaining within a tight range around 5.30 through September 18, 2024. During this same timeframe spreads in the lower and core middle market, our primary area of focus, modestly compressed from levels seen roughly a year ago. As a result, the weighted average yields on debt are slightly lower than prior periods though our investment income continued to grow due to the significant, continued growth of the Fund s portfolio.

Interest Expense 
 Total interest expense (including unused fees and amortization of deferred financing costs) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 8.2 million and 18.3 million, respectively. Total interest expense (including unused fees and amortization of deferred financing costs) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 0.9 million and 1.9 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by greater borrowings under our credit facilities as we continue to grow the portfolio. The average principal balance outstanding increased from 17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 307.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Management Fees 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management fees were 2.0 million and 5.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 management fees were 0.8 million and 1.4 million, respectively. The Adviser waived management fees from March 13, 2023 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2023, which resulted in a waiver of 0.8 million and 1.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Management fees are payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of the value of our net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. 
 Income Based Incentive Fees 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income based incentive fees were 2.5 million and 6.3 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, income based incentive fees were 0.9 million and 1.4 million, respectively. The Adviser waived income based incentive fees from March 13, 2023 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2023, which resulted in a waiver of 0.9 million and 1.4 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 63 

Capital Gains Based Incentive Fees 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized reductions in accrued capital gains incentive fees of 0.6) million and 0.5) million, respectively, none of which is payable under the Advisory Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we accrued capital gains incentive fees of 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively, none of which was payable under the Advisory Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in accrued incentive fees was attributable to net realized and change in unrealized losses of 4.2) million and of 4.3) million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change in accrued incentive fees was attributable to net realized and change in unrealized gains of 2.0 million and 3.5 million, respectively. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. 
 Other Expenses 
 Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Fund. Administration fees represent expenses incurred for services provided by FDS in its capacity as Administrator in accordance with the terms of the Administration Agreement. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, subscriptions and other costs. 
 Total other expenses were 1.4 million and 3.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 1.1 million and 2.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Total other expenses were primarily composed of professional fees, the amortization of our offering costs, administration fees, other general and administrative expenses and Board of Trustees fees. Increases in expenses were primarily driven by the larger portfolio and associated costs with managing the Fund. 
 We entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with the Adviser. For additional information see Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Related Party Agreements and Transactions. 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify annually for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual required distributable amount of income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.

The Fund holds certain portfolio investments through wholly-owned subsidiaries taxed as corporations which may be subject to federal and state taxes. The wholly-owned subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Fund for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities as a result of its ownership of certain portfolio investments. Deferred tax liabilities are estimated and may differ materially depending on conditions when these investments earn income or are disposed. Income or gains recognized as a result of these investments will be reflected as a current tax liability and expense. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the Fund s consolidated financial statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Fund, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, recorded tax liabilities of 363,004 and 0 which are included in other accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of our debt investments decreased due to spread tightening in the credit market and the financial performance of our portfolio companies, offset predominantly by the performance of several portfolio companies. The net change in unrealized appreciation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the spread tightening in the credit market. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Fund incurred a change in unrealized depreciation due to the reversal of unrealized appreciation on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies recognized during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. The change in unrealized depreciation is offset by a realized gain on foreign currency transactions realized upon repayment of foreign denominated borrowings. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of our continuous offering of Common Shares, proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facilities, income earned and repayments on principal on our debt investments. The primary uses of our cash are for (i) originating and purchasing debt and other investments, (ii) funding the costs of our operations (including fees paid to our Adviser and expense reimbursements paid to our Administrator), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs, (iv) funding repurchases under our share repurchase program and (v) cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had two revolving credit facilities outstanding. The Fund may, from time to time, enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities or issue additional debt securities, including debt securitizations, unsecured debt or other forms of debt. Any such incurrence or issuance may be from sources within the U.S. or from various foreign geographies or jurisdictions and may be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Additionally, any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Fund had 472.5 million and 105.8 million of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facilities, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and our asset coverage ratio was 243 and 483 , respectively. 
 Cash as of September 30, 2024, taken together with our 277.5 million of available capacity under our credit facilities (subject to borrowing base availability), proceeds from new or amended financing arrangements and the continuous offering of our Common Shares is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. This determination is based in part on our expectations for the timing of funding investment purchases and the timing and amount of future proceeds from sales of our Common Shares and the use of existing and future financing arrangements. We plan to fund using proceeds from offering our Common Shares and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities for new investments. 
 Although we have attractive financing arrangements, any disruption in the financial markets or any other negative economic development could restrict our access to incremental financing in the future. We may not be able to find new financing for future investments or liquidity needs and, even if we are able to obtain such financing, such financing may not be on as favorable terms as we could have obtained previously. These factors may limit our ability to make new investments and adversely impact our results of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 23.7 million in cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 570.4 million primarily as a result of funding new investments modestly offset by sales of investments and principal repayments. Cash provided by financing activities was 592.7 million during the period primarily as a result of new share issuances and net borrowings, partially offset by share repurchases and distributions to shareholders. 
 As of September 30, 2023 we had 0.6 million in cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 324.1 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments. Cash provided by financing activities was 324.7 million during the period, primarily as a result of new share issuances and net borrowings, partially offset by the payment of financing costs.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 there were no Class S or Class D distributions. 
 With respect to distributions, the Fund has adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan for shareholders (other than shareholders residing in certain states that require an opt in plan). As a result, in the event of a declared cash distribution or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the distribution reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. Shareholders located in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington, as well as those who are clients of certain participating brokers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan, will automatically receive their distributions in cash unless they elect to participate in our distribution reinvestment plan and have their cash distributions reinvested in additional Common Shares.

Share Repurchase Program 
 At the discretion of the Board, the Fund has commenced a share repurchase program in which the Fund may repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of the NAV of the Fund s Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the best interest of shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Fund s liquidity, adversely affect the Fund s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Fund that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. The Fund intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under the share repurchase plan, to the extent the Fund offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, it is expected to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at an Early Repurchase Deduction. The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Fund for the benefit of remaining shareholders across all shares.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not expect to have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. 
 Our investment portfolio contains and is expected to continue to contain debt investments in the form of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the underlying loan agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unfunded commitments to borrowers in the aggregate principal amount of 196.3 million and 99.3 million, respectively. 
 From time to time, the Fund may become party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024, management is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation. 
 Related-Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following;

the Administration Agreement; 

the Transfer Agent Agreement;

See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Related Party Agreements and Transactions . 
 Recent Developments 
 See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10. Subsequent Events for a summary of recent developments. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ.

Fair Value Measurements 
 The Fund values its investments, upon which its NAV is based, in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also provides a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the observability of inputs used to measure fair value and prescribes disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5, the Board has designated the Adviser as the valuation designee responsible for valuing all of the Fund s investments, including making fair valuation determinations as needed. The Adviser has established a Fair Value Committee to carry out the day-to-day fair valuation responsibilities and has adopted policies and procedures to govern activities of the Fair Value Committee and the performance of functions required to determine the fair value of a fund s investments in good faith. These functions include periodically assessing and managing material risks associated with fair value determinations, selecting, applying, reviewing, and testing fair value methodologies, monitoring for circumstances that may necessitate the use of fair value, and overseeing and evaluating pricing services used. 
 In accordance with the Adviser s policies and procedures, which have been approved by the Board, investments, including debt securities, that are publicly traded but for which no readily available market quotations exist are generally valued on the basis of information furnished by an independent third-party pricing service that uses a valuation matrix which incorporates both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data processing techniques. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures, engages in oversight activities with respect to third-party pricing sources used and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. The Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe market quotations or prices received from third-party pricing services are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. 
 Investments that are not publicly traded or whose current market prices or quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by the Adviser in good faith pursuant to the Adviser s Board-approved policies and procedures. Factors used in determining fair value vary by investment type and may include market or investment specific events, transaction data, estimated cash flows, and market observations of comparable investments. In determining fair value of the Fund s loan investments the types of factors that the Fair Value Committee may take into account generally include comparison to publicly-traded securities including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. 
 The Fund has engaged an independent valuation firm to prepare month-end valuation recommendations for investments for which market quotations are not readily available as of the last calendar day of each month. The independent valuation firm undertakes a full analysis of the investments and provides estimated fair values for such investments to the Adviser. The independent valuation firm also provides analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations. The Adviser s Fair Value Committee reviews and approves each valuation recommendation and confirms it has been calculated in accordance with the Board-approved policies and procedures. The Fair Value Committee manages the Fund s fair valuation practices and maintains the fair valuation policies and procedures. The Adviser reports to the Board information regarding the fair valuation process and related material matters. The Board may determine to modify its designation of the Adviser as valuation designee, relating to any or all Fund investments, at any time. 
 Our accounting policy regarding the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and requires the use of estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining fair value measurements, the fair values of our investments may differ from the amounts that we ultimately realize or collect from sales or maturities of our investments, and the differences could be material. 
 72 

Item 3. Quantitative a nd Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, based on, among other things, input from independent third-party valuation firms engaged to review our investments. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we are required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on our investments to be different than the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) reflected in the valuations currently recorded. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates, including changes due to inflation. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure shareholders that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 100.0 of our debt investments at fair value were at floating rates. Based on our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering base rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure):

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Treasurer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OT HER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal P roceedings. 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceedings threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of any such legal or regulatory framework cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that any such future proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 

74 

Item 2. Unre gistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Share Repurchases 
 We have commenced a share repurchase program in which we intend to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (by number of shares) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. Our Board of Trustees may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our operations. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV. 
 The following table sets forth information regarding repurchases of shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:
