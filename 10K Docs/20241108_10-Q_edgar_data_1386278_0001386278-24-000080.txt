Substantially all of the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of the respective periods are recognized in the first half of each year. Changes in the deferred revenue balance are driven primarily by the amount of new card fees recognized during the period, and the degree to which these reductions to the deferred revenue balance are offset by the deferral of new card fees associated with cards sold during the period.

 We offer an optional overdraft protection program service on certain demand deposit account programs that allows customers who opt-in and meet certain criteria to spend up to a pre-authorized amount in excess of their available account balance. When overdrawn, the purchase related balances due on these deposit accounts are reclassified as consumer loans. Fees due from our accountholders for our overdraft service are included as a component of accounts receivable. Overdrawn balances are unsecured and considered immediately due from the customer. Also included in consumer loans are advances made to taxpayers under our tax advance program. These loan balances generally fluctuate over the first half of each year due to the seasonal nature of these advances. 
 A portion of our secured credit card portfolio is classified as loans held for sale. These loans are included in the long-term portion of prepaid and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in valuation allowances are recorded as a component of other income and expenses on our consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the loans held for sale amounted to approximately million and million, respectively.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 We closely monitor and assess the credit quality and credit risk of our loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. We continuously review and update loan risk classifications. We evaluate our loans using non-classified or classified as the primary credit quality indicator. Classified loans include those designated as substandard, doubtful, or loss, consistent with regulatory guidelines. Secured credit card loans are considered classified if they are greater than 90 days past due. However, our secured credit card portfolio is collateralized by cash deposits made by each accountholder in an amount equal to the user's available credit limit, which mitigates the risk of any significant credit losses we expect to incur.

 ownership interest in the entity, in exchange for annual capital contributions of million per year from January 2020 through January 2024. Our final payment under this commitment was made in January 2024. 
 We account for our investment in TailFin Labs under the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323 , Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Under the equity method of accounting, the initial investment is recorded at cost and the investment is subsequently adjusted for, among other things, its proportionate share of earnings or losses. However, given the capital structure of the TailFin Labs arrangement, we apply the Hypothetical Liquidation Book Value ("HLBV") method to determine the allocation of profits and losses since our liquidation rights and priorities, as defined by the agreement, differ from our underlying ownership interest. The HLBV method calculates the proceeds that would be attributable to each partner in an investment based on the liquidation provisions of the agreement if the partnership was to be liquidated at book value as of the balance sheet date. Each partner s allocation of income or loss in the period is equal to the change in the amount of net equity they are legally able to claim based on a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at the end of a reporting period compared to the beginning of that period, adjusted for any capital transactions. Any future economic benefits derived from products or services developed by TailFin Labs will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis between the parties. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our net investment in TailFin Labs amounted to approximately million and million, respectively, and is included in the long-term portion of prepaid expenses and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We recorded equity in losses from TailFin Labs of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are recorded as a component of other income and expense on our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Our equity method investments also include an investment held by our bank, which amounted to million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Equity in earnings from this investment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not significant.

 2019 Revolving Facility 
 In October 2019, we entered into a secured credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and other lenders party thereto. The credit agreement provided for a million revolving line of credit (the "2019 Revolving Facility"), which matured in October 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the then-outstanding balance on the 2019 Revolving Facility was repaid in full, and the 2019 Revolving Facility terminated at its maturity date. 
 We incurred total cash interest expense on our debt during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately million and million, respectively and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of million and million, respectively.

 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 , primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal tax benefits, general business credits, stock-based compensation, nondeductible expenses and penalties, cash surrender value growth in bank owned life insurance policies, and the Internal Revenue Code (the "IRC") 162(m) limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation. The net decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the impact of a decrease of million in the amount of compensation expense that was subject to the IRC 162(m) limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, a decrease of million in state income taxes, net of federal benefits, and the impact of general business credits. These decreases were partially offset by a million increase in tax expense associated with shortfalls from stock-based compensation, an increase in tax expense due to nondeductible expenses and penalties, and the surrender of our existing bank owned life insurance policies which resulted in a tax charge of million and surrender penalties of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized a discrete tax expense related to tax shortfalls from stock-based compensation of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a million discrete tax expense for the prior year comparable period. The increase in nondeductible expenses and penalties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to the tax effect associated with the civil money penalty for the Consent Order (defined below) discussed in Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies. 
 We have made a policy election to account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI") in the year the GILTI tax is incurred. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the provision for GILTI tax expense was not material to our financial statements. 
 We establish a valuation allowance when we consider it more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did t have a valuation allowance on any of our deferred tax assets as we believe it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets. 
 We are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and various state tax authorities. We remain subject to examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2017 through 2023. We generally remain subject to examination of our various state income tax returns for a period of four to from the respective dates that the returns were filed. The IRS initiated an examination of our 2017 U.S. federal tax return during the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, and the examination remains ongoing as of September 30, 2024. We do not expect that this examination will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

 Other Litigation and Claims 
 On December 18, 2019, an alleged class action entitled Koffsmon v. Green Dot Corp., et al. , No. 19-cv-10701-DDP-E, was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, against us and of our former officers. The suit asserts purported claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act for allegedly misleading statements regarding our business strategy. Plaintiff alleges that defendants made statements that were

 reportable segments: 1) Consumer Services, 2) Business to Business ("B2B") Services, and 3) Money Movement Services. 
 Our Consumer Services segment consists of revenues and expenses derived from deposit account programs, such as consumer checking accounts, prepaid cards, secured credit cards, and gift cards that we offer to consumers (i) through distribution arrangements with more than retail locations and thousands of neighborhood Financial Service Center locations (the "Retail channel"), and (ii) directly through various marketing channels, such as online search engine optimization, online displays, direct mail campaigns, mobile advertising, and affiliate referral programs (the "Direct channel"). 
 Our B2B Services segment consists of revenues and expenses derived from (i) our partnerships with some of the United States' most prominent consumer and technology companies that make our banking products and services available to their consumers, partners and workforce through integration with our banking platform (the "Banking-as-a-Service", or "BaaS channel"), and (ii) a comprehensive payroll platform that we offer to corporate enterprises (the "Employer channel") to facilitate payments for today s workforce. Our products and services in this segment include deposit account programs, such as consumer and small business checking accounts and prepaid cards, as well as our disbursements services utilized by our partners. 
 Our Money Movement Services segment consists of revenues and expenses generated on a per transaction basis from our services that specialize in facilitating the movement of cash on behalf of consumers and businesses, such as money processing services and tax refund processing services. Our money processing services, such as cash deposit and disbursements, are marketed to third-party banks, program managers, and other companies seeking cash deposit and disbursement capabilities for their customers. Those customers, including our own accountholders, can access our cash deposit and disbursement services at any of the locations within our network of retail distributors and neighborhood Financial Service Centers. We market our tax-related financial services through a network of tax preparation franchises, independent tax professionals and online tax preparation providers. 
 Our Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of net interest income, certain other investment income earned by our bank, interest profit sharing arrangements with certain BaaS partners (a reduction of revenue), eliminations of inter-segment revenues and expenses, and unallocated corporate expenses, which include our fixed expenses such as salaries, wages and related benefits for our employees, professional services fees, software licenses, telephone and communication costs, rent, utilities, and insurance. These costs are not considered when our CODM evaluates the performance of our reportable segments since they are not directly attributable to any reporting segment. Non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, impairment charges, and other non-recurring expenses that are not considered by our CODM when evaluating our overall consolidated financial results are excluded from our unallocated corporate expenses

 Overview 
 Green Dot Corporation is a financial technology and registered bank holding company ("BHC") committed to giving all people the power to bank seamlessly, affordably, and with confidence. Our technology platform enables us to build products and features that address the most pressing financial challenges of consumers and businesses, transforming the way they manage and move money, and making financial empowerment more accessible for all. Through Green Dot Bank, our wholly-owned subsidiary, we offer a suite of financial products to consumers and businesses including debit, prepaid, checking, credit and payroll cards, as well as robust money processing services, such as tax refund processing, cash deposits and disbursements. 
 Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (our "CODM" who is our Chief Executive Officer) organizes and manages our businesses primarily on the basis of the channels in which our product and services are offered and uses net revenue and segment profit to assess profitability. Segment profit reflects each segment's net revenue less direct costs, such as sales and marketing expenses, processing expenses, third-party call center support and transaction losses. Our operations are aggregated amongst three reportable segments: 1) Consumer Services, 2) Business to Business ("B2B") Services, and 3) Money Movement Services. Net interest income, certain other investment income earned by our bank, interest profit sharing arrangements with certain BaaS partners (a reduction of revenue), eliminations of inter-segment revenues and expenses, and unallocated corporate expenses that are not considered when our CODM evaluates the performance of our three reportable segments are recorded in Corporate and Other expenses. Refer to our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K "Part I, Item 1. Business" for more detailed information about our operations and Note 19 Segment Information in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Consolidated Financial Results and Trends 
 Our consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change (In thousands, except percentages) Total operating revenues 409,743 353,029 56,714 16.1 1,268,852 1,135,285 133,567 11.8 Total operating expenses 412,675 359,868 52,807 14.7 1,284,897 1,086,343 198,554 18.3 Net (loss) income (7,840) (6,265) (1,575) 25.1 (31,805) 30,325 (62,130) (204.9) 
 Refer to "Segment Results" below for a summary of financial results of each of our reportable segments.

 Total operating revenues 
 Our total operating revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 56.7 million or 16 , and 133.6 million, or 12 , respectively, over the prior year comparable periods, driven primarily by higher revenues in our B2B Services segment and to a lesser extent in our Money Movement Services segment, partially offset by lower revenues earned in our Consumer Services segment. 
 Our consolidated total operating revenues increased year-over-year due to the continued growth of certain BaaS partner programs, which generated an increase in our total gross dollar volume for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 35 and 32 , respectively. However, our total operating revenues were negatively impacted by several other factors impacting our deposit account programs, as discussed below, that impacted the number of consolidated active accounts, purchase volume, and number of cash transfers, each of which decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 6 , 9 , and 1 respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, purchase volume and the number of cash transfers decreased by 12 and 6 , respectively, over the prior year comparable period. 
 In our Consumer Services segment, revenues decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 17 and 24 , respectively, over the prior year comparable periods. Gross dollar volume, the number of active accounts, the number of direct deposit active accounts and purchase volume each declined year-over-year for the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 14 , 18 , 15 and 18 , respectively. Similarly, gross dollar volume and purchase volume declined for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 19 and 22 , respectively. We believe these decreases in our Consumer Services segment are attributable to several factors, including our decision to wind-down many of our legacy accountholder programs in support of GO2bank, macro-economic factors leading to economic challenges for consumers and other competitive trends that have impacted acquisition at retail locations, and the non-renewal of one of our retail partner programs, as previously disclosed. These factors had a corresponding impact on the amount of accountholder fee revenue we earn from accounts, including monthly maintenance fees, new card fees, ATM fees and interchange fees. Revenues within this segment were also adversely impacted by a decrease in breakage revenue on our gift card portfolios for each of the comparable periods. 
 In our B2B Services segment, revenues increased by 39 and 40 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, over the prior year comparable periods. The increase was driven by strong year-over-year growth in our gross dollar volume, which increased during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 46 , and to a lesser extent, growth in purchase volume, which also increased during each of the respective periods by 10 . The number of active accounts for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 11 over the prior year comparable period. The growth in gross dollar volume was driven primarily by certain BaaS programs that do not generate interchange fees and resulted in a net increase in segment revenue due to higher program management service fees earned from these BaaS partners, partially offset by the non-renewals of certain other BaaS partners, as previously disclosed. 
 In our Money Movement Services segment, revenues decreased by less than 1 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased by 4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the prior year comparable periods. The decrease in our Money Movement Services revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by a decrease in cash transfer revenues. Our cash transfer revenues decreased from the comparable prior year period primarily due to a 1 decrease in the number of cash transfers processed during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and an unfavorable mix of cash transfer types and locations where the transactions occurred, as the fees we receive vary depending on these factors. Our tax processing revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained consistent year over year. Due to the seasonal nature of our tax products and services, substantially all of our tax processing revenues are earned during the first half of each year. 
 The increase in our Money Movement Services segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by an increase in our tax processing revenues, partially offset by a decrease in cash transfer revenues. Although the number of tax refunds processed decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 2 , our tax processing revenues increased due to a favorable mix-shift in the distribution channel in which the tax refund was processed and from the expansion of our taxpayer advance programs. These increases were partially offset by a 6 decline in the number of cash transfers processed for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the prior year comparable period. The decline in the number of cash transfers processed was due to a lower number of active accounts within our Consumer Services segment discussed above. The Green Dot Network is a service provider to accountholders in both our Consumer Services and B2B Services segments, as well as third-party programs.

 Net interest income earned by Green Dot Bank, a component of our Corporate and Other segment, increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 92 and 50 , respectively, over the prior year comparable periods. The increase in net interest income was primarily the result of an increase in cash from deposit programs with our partners and yields earned at the Federal Reserve, partially offset by an increase in interest shared with certain BaaS partners (a reduction of revenue). 
 Total operating expenses 
 Our total operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 52.8 million, or 15 , and 198.6 million, or 18 , respectively, over the prior year comparable periods. 
 The increase in our total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by an increase in processing expenses associated with the growth of certain BaaS account programs within our B2B Services segment as discussed above, partially offset by reductions in processor costs realized from the processor migration to our in-licensed card management platform. To a lesser extent, our total operating expenses also increased due to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses, driven primarily by an increase in third-party call center support costs associated with the growth of the BaaS account programs discussed above, partially offset by lower salary and wages driven by the reduction in employee workforce we initiated in February 2024, as previously disclosed (the "Headcount Reduction"). These increases were partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenses, principally due to decreases in sales commissions from lower revenues on products subject to tiered revenue-sharing agreements, and lower other general and administrative expenses, primarily driven by a decrease in transaction losses due to a decrease in the amount of customer dispute volume across our portfolios and favorable reductions in our dispute loss rates. This decrease in other general and administrative expenses was partially offset by higher professional services fees related to our anti-money laundering ("AML") programs, including improvements to our compliance controls, policies and procedures. 
 Our total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased over the prior year comparable period. Processing expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the same factors discussed above. Other general and administrative expenses increased due to penalties paid under the consent order (the "Consent Order") we received from the Federal Reserve Board, as previously disclosed and discussed further below, higher professional services fees related to our AML programs, and the settlement payment and impairment charges related to internal-use software and other related assets associated with the termination of our partnership agreement to develop a new core banking system, as previously disclosed during the first quarter of 2024. Other general and administrative expenses also increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in overall transaction losses attributable to an increase in the amount of customer dispute volume across our portfolios. These increases were partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenses due to the same factors discussed above, and lower compensation and benefits expenses, primarily due to lower salary and wages driven by the Headcount Reduction and lower employee stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to a higher number of forfeited awards. 
 As previously disclosed, on July 19, 2024, we and our subsidiary bank received a Consent Order from the Federal Reserve Board relating principally to various aspects of compliance risk management, including consumer compliance and compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. Included in the Consent Order was a civil money penalty related to these issues in the amount of 44 million which was subsequently paid in July 2024. We previously accrued an estimated liability of 20 million related to the Consent Order during the three months ended December 31, 2023, and the remaining portion was accrued during the three months ended June 30, 2024. For further discussion, see the headings " As a bank holding company, we are subject to extensive and potentially changing regulation and are required to serve as a source of strength for Green Dot Bank " and Litigation or investigations could result in significant settlements, sanctions, fines or penalties included as part of our risk factor disclosures in Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 
 Income taxes 
 Our income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.2 million, or 77 , from the prior year comparable period primarily due to the impact of the surrender of our existing bank owned life insurance policies, and our income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 9.0 million, or 87 , from the prior year comparable period primarily due to a decrease in our year-to-date taxable income. 
 Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5 , a decrease from 26 for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in state income taxes expense, net of federal benefits, the impact of general business credits, tax benefits from bank owned life insurance policies, and a reduction in the amount of compensation expense that was subject to the Internal 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 Revenue Code (the "IRC") Section 162(m) limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. These decreases were partially offset by incremental taxes and penalties ("surrender penalties") we incurred in connection with the surrender and restructuring of our existing bank owned life insurance policies, an increase in tax expense associated with shortfalls from stock-based compensation, and an increase in tax expense due to nondeductible expenses and penalties. The increase in nondeductible expenses and penalties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to the tax effect associated with the civil money penalty for the Consent Order. 
 In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") released model rules introducing a 15 global minimum tax rate for large multinational corporations ("Pillar Two"). Certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation consistent with the OECD model rules effective beginning in 2024. We are monitoring legislative developments and continuing to evaluate the potential impact of Pillar Two on our consolidated financial statements, but do not expect it will have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods. 
 Outlook and Other Trends Affecting Our Business 
 Based on the overall macro-economic environment, the effect of elevated inflation and interest rates, our commitment to making growth-oriented investments and the timing of the related expense savings from our processor migration to our in-licensed card management platform, the previously-disclosed non-renewals in our Consumer Services and B2B Services segments, our decision to wind-down many of our legacy accountholder programs in support of GO2bank, trends occurring within our retail channel in our Consumer Services segment, and our investments in our compliance programs, we have experienced declining trends in our consolidated operating results in recent periods. However, we do not expect some of these trends or events to persist, such as partner non-renewals and the discontinuation of certain legacy accountholder programs. After taking into consideration the one-time nature of our Consent Order accrual and other charges, we expect our results of operations will stabilize on a year-over-year basis over the remainder of 2024 based on our anticipated initiatives and cost reduction measures we have implemented. 
 We intend to continue to make growth-oriented investments and incur other expenditures that we believe will benefit our long-term financial results. Our growth-oriented investments are focused on, among other things, cost-effectively re-engaging in strategic marketing initiatives in support of our GO2bank product and other initiatives across our account programs with the objective of returning to active account growth. 
 We have seen reductions in our processing expenses from our processor conversion and expect the implementation of our card management platform will allow us to continue to realize reductions in our processing expenses as we seek to expand account programs. 
 We have seen our cost reduction initiatives partially offset by increases in other areas, as we have incurred additional expenses in connection with our continued investments in our AML program, including improvements to our compliance controls, policies and procedures, which we believe will ultimately help us to continue to remediate matters identified in the Consent Order and mitigate and reduce our fraud losses over the long term. 
 In September 2024, the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates by 50 basis points, the first rate cut in over four years, and further reduced interest rates by an additional 25 basis points in early November 2024. Although we remain in an elevated interest rate environment, the general market consensus is that interest rates will gradually decrease further over the near term. The Federal Reserve's decision-making policies for short-term interest rates will continue to impact the amount of net interest income we earn in the future. In general, while increases in short-term interest rates benefit the yield we earn on our cash, certain of our BaaS partner arrangements allow for the BaaS partner to share in a significant portion of the interest earned from accountholder deposits (which are recorded as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated financial statements), and yields on our investment portfolio tend to lag interest rate increases as securities mature and proceeds are reinvested. Accordingly, the net effect has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated financial statements and will be dependent upon future interest rate changes enacted by the Federal Reserve. 
 Further, the duration and magnitude of the continuing effects of macro-economic factors remain uncertain and dependent on various factors outside of our control. See Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for an additional discussion of risks related to macro-economic factors.

 Consolidated Key Metrics 
 We review a number of metrics to help us monitor the performance of, and identify trends affecting, our business. We believe the following measures are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual revenues: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change (In millions, except percentages) Gross dollar volume 33,473 24,836 8,637 34.8 96,358 72,849 23,509 32.3 Number of active accounts 3.46 3.67 (0.21) (5.7) n/a n/a n/a n/a Purchase volume 4,887 5,362 (475) (8.9) 15,173 17,241 (2,068) (12.0) Number of cash transfers 8.22 8.31 (0.09) (1.1) 24.14 25.67 (1.53) (6.0) Number of tax refunds processed 0.19 0.20 (0.01) (3.0) 13.67 13.98 (0.31) (2.2) 
 Represents the number of active accounts as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 See Segment Results for additional information and discussion regarding key metrics performance by segment. The definitions of our key metrics are as follows: 
 Gross Dollar Volume Represents the total dollar volume of funds loaded to our account products from direct deposit and non-direct deposit sources. A substantial portion of our gross dollar volume is generated from direct deposit sources. We use this metric to analyze the total amount of money moving onto our account programs, and to determine the overall engagement and usage patterns of our accountholder base. This metric also serves as a leading indicator of revenue generated through our Consumer Services and B2B Services segments, inclusive of fees charged to accountholders and interchange revenues generated through the spending of account balances. 
 Number of Active Accounts Represents any bank account within our Consumer Services and B2B Services segments that is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 compliance and, therefore, requires customer identity verification prior to use and is intended to accept ongoing customer cash or ACH deposits. This metric includes checking accounts, general purpose reloadable prepaid card accounts, and secured credit card accounts in our portfolio that had at least one purchase, deposit or ATM withdrawal transaction during the applicable quarter. We use this metric to analyze the overall size of our active customer base and to analyze multiple metrics expressed as an average across this active account base. 
 Our direct deposit active accounts within our Consumer Services segment, on average, have the longest tenure and generate the majority of our gross dollar volume in any period and thus, generate more revenue over their lifetime than other active accounts. Refer to sub-section entitled Consumer Services under Segment Results below for key metric results for direct deposit active accounts. 
 Purchase Volume Represents the total dollar volume of purchase transactions made by our accountholders. This metric excludes the dollar volume of ATM withdrawals and volume generated by certain BaaS programs where the BaaS partner receives interchange fees and we earn a program management service fee. We use this metric to analyze interchange revenue, which is a key component of our financial performance. 
 Number of Cash Transfers Represents the total number of cash transfer transactions conducted by consumers, such as a point-of-sale swipe reload transaction, the purchase of a MoneyPak or an e-cash mobile remittance transaction marketed under various brand names, that we conducted through our retail distributors in a specified period. This metric excludes disbursements made through our wage disbursement platform. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our retail cash processing network, as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services, and to analyze cash transfer revenue, which is a key component of our financial performance. 
 Number of Tax Refunds Processed Represents the total number of tax refunds processed in a specified period. The number of tax refunds processed is most concentrated during the first half of each year and is minimal during the second half of each year. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our tax refund processing platform and as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of its products and services.

 Key components of our results of operations 
 Operating Revenues 
 We classify our operating revenues into the following four categories: 
 Card Revenues and Other Fees Card revenues consist of monthly maintenance fees, ATM fees, new card fees and other revenues. We charge maintenance fees on prepaid cards, checking accounts and certain cash transfer products, such as MoneyPak, pursuant to the terms and conditions in our customer agreements. We charge ATM fees to accountholders when they withdraw money at certain ATMs in accordance with the terms and conditions in our accountholder agreements. We charge new card fees, if applicable, when a consumer purchases a prepaid card, gift card, or a checking account product through our Retail channel. Other revenues consist primarily of revenue associated with our gift card program, annual fees associated with our secured credit card portfolio, transaction-based fees, fees associated with optional products or services, such as our overdraft protection program, and cash-back rewards we offer to accountholders. Our cash-back rewards are recorded as a reduction to card revenues and other fees. Also included in card revenues and other fees are program management service fees earned from our BaaS partners for programs we manage on their behalf. 
 Our aggregate monthly maintenance fee revenues vary primarily based upon the number of active accounts in our portfolio and the average fee assessed per account. Our average monthly maintenance fee per active account depends upon the mix of products in our portfolio at any given point in time and upon the extent to which fees are waived based on various incentives provided to customers in an effort to encourage higher usage and retention. Our aggregate ATM fee revenues vary based upon the number of accountholder ATM transactions and the average fee per ATM transaction. The average fee per ATM transaction depends upon the mix of products in our portfolio at any given point in time and the extent to which accountholders use ATMs within our free network that carry no fee for cash withdrawal transactions. Our aggregate new card fee revenues vary based upon the number of prepaid cards and checking accounts activated and the average new card fee. The average new card fee depends primarily upon the mix of products that we sell since there are variations in new account fees based on the product and/or the location or source where our products are purchased. The revenue we earn from each of these fees may also vary depending upon the channel in which the active accounts were acquired. For example, certain BaaS programs may not assess monthly maintenance fees and as a result, these accounts may generate lower fee revenue than other active accounts. Our aggregate other fees vary primarily based upon account sales of all types, gift card sales, purchase transactions and the number of active accounts in our portfolio. 
 Cash Processing Revenues Cash processing revenues consist of cash transfer revenues, tax refund processing service revenues, disbursement revenues and other tax processing service revenues. We earn cash transfer revenues when consumers fund their cards through a reload transaction at a Green Dot Network retail location. Our aggregate cash transfer revenues vary based upon the mix of locations where reload transactions occur, since reload fees vary by location. We earn tax refund processing service revenues at the point in time when a customer of a third-party tax preparation company chooses to pay his or her tax preparation fee through the use of our tax refund processing services. We earn disbursement fees from our business partners at the point in time payment disbursements are made. 
 Interchange Revenues We earn interchange revenues from fees remitted by the merchant s bank, which are based on rates established by the payment networks, at the point in time when customers make purchase transactions using our products. Our aggregate interchange revenues vary based primarily on the number of active accounts in our portfolio, the average transactional volume of the active accounts in our portfolio, the merchant category of spend, and on the mix of accountholder purchases between those using signature identification technologies and those using personal identification numbers and the corresponding rates. 
 Interest Income, net Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities held at Green Dot Bank. Interest-earning assets include cash from customer deposits, loans, and investment securities. Our interest-bearing liabilities held at Green Dot Bank include interest-bearing deposits. Our net interest income and our net interest margin fluctuate based on changes in the federal funds interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-bearing assets and liabilities. 
 Operating Expenses 
 We classify our operating expenses into the following four categories: 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the commissions we pay to our retail distributors, brokers and partners, advertising and marketing expenses, and the costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages, placards and promotional materials to our retail distributors and personalized debit

 cards to consumers who have activated their cards. We generally establish commission percentages in long-term distribution agreements with our retail distributors and partners. Aggregate commissions with our retail distributors are determined by the number of account products and cash transfers sold at their respective retail stores. Commissions with our partners and, in certain cases, our retail distributors are determined by the revenue generated from the ongoing use of the associated card programs. We incur advertising and marketing expenses for television, sponsorships, online and in-store promotions. Advertising and marketing expenses are recognized as incurred and typically deliver a benefit over an extended period of time. For this reason, these expenses do not always track changes in our operating revenues. Our manufacturing and distribution costs vary primarily based on the number of accounts activated by consumers. 
 Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expenses represent the compensation and benefits that we provide to our employees and the payments we make to third-party contractors. While we have an in-house customer service function, we employ third-party contractors to conduct call center operations, handle routine customer service inquiries and provide consulting support in the area of IT operations and elsewhere. Compensation and benefits expenses associated with our customer service and loss management functions generally vary in line with the size of our active account portfolio, while the expenses associated with other functions do not. 
 Processing Expenses Processing expenses consist primarily of the fees charged to us by the payment networks, which process transactions for us, the third-party card processors that maintain the records of our customers' accounts and process transaction authorizations and postings for us and the third-party banks that issue our accounts. These costs generally vary based on the total number of active accounts in our portfolio and gross dollar volume transacted by those accounts. Also included in processing expenses are bank fees associated with our tax refund processing services and gateway and network fees associated with our disbursement services. Bank fees generally vary based on the total number of tax refund transfers processed and gateway and network fees vary based on the number of disbursements made. 
 Other General and Administrative Expenses Other general and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional services fees, telephone and communication costs, depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment, amortization of our intangible assets, impairment charges of long-lived assets, transaction losses (losses from customer disputed transactions, unrecovered customer purchase transaction overdrafts and fraud), rent and utilities, and insurance. We incur telephone and communication costs primarily from customers contacting us through our toll-free telephone numbers. These costs vary with the total number of active accounts in our portfolio, as do losses from customer disputed transactions, unrecovered customer purchase transaction overdrafts and fraud. Costs associated with professional services, depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment, amortization of our acquired intangible assets, impairment charges of long-lived assets, rent and utilities vary based upon our investment in infrastructure, business development, risk management and internal controls and are generally not correlated with our operating revenues or other transaction metrics. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Our income tax expense (benefit) consists of the federal and state corporate income taxes accrued on income resulting from the sale of our products and services.

 Comparison of Consolidated Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Operating Revenues 
 The following table presents a breakdown of our operating revenues among card revenues and other fees, cash processing revenues, interchange revenues and net interest income: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Amount of Total Operating Revenues Amount of Total Operating Revenues (In thousands, except percentages) Operating revenues: Card revenues and other fees 310,372 75.8 253,407 71.7 Cash processing revenues 34,897 8.5 36,256 10.3 Interchange revenues 48,397 11.8 54,968 15.6 Interest income, net 16,077 3.9 8,398 2.4 Total operating revenues 409,743 100.0 353,029 100.0 
 Card Revenues and Other Fees Card revenues and other fees totaled 310.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 57.0 million, or 22 , from the comparable prior year period. Card revenues and other fees increased primarily due to growth in gross dollar volume in our B2B Services segment programs, which resulted in higher program management service fees earned from our BaaS partners. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accountholder fees, such as monthly maintenance fees, ATM fees and new card fees for the reasons discussed above in "Overview." In addition, the increase in card revenues and other fees was partially offset by a decrease in breakage revenue on our gift card portfolios. 
 Cash Processing Revenues Cash processing revenues totaled 34.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.4 million, or 4 , from the comparable prior year period. The decrease was driven by lower cash transfer revenues. Our cash transfer revenues decreased from the comparable prior year period primarily due to a 1 decrease in the number of cash transfers processed during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and an unfavorable mix of cash transfer types and locations where the transactions occurred, as the fees we receive vary depending on these factors. 
 Interchange Revenues Interchange revenues totaled 48.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.6 million, or 12 , from the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in purchase volume of 9 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as well as a lower effective interchange rate earned for the comparable periods. Our interchange rate declined due to a mix-shift toward categories of consumer purchases with lower effective rates. In addition, our interchange fees have both fixed and variable components, and as a result, the effective rate we earn may vary based on the size of transactions, among other factors. 
 Interest Income, net Net interest income totaled 16.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.7 million, or 92 , from the comparable prior year period. The increase in net interest income was primarily the result of an increase in cash from deposit programs with our partners and yields earned at the Federal Reserve, partially offset by an increase in interest shared with certain BaaS partners (a reduction of revenue).

 Operating Expenses 
 The following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses among sales and marketing, compensation and benefits, processing, and other general and administrative expenses: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Amount of Total Operating Revenues Amount of Total Operating Revenues (In thousands, except percentages) Operating expenses: Sales and marketing expenses 52,626 12.8 56,495 16.0 Compensation and benefits expenses 61,795 15.1 59,168 16.8 Processing expenses 228,227 55.7 162,375 46.0 Other general and administrative expenses 70,027 17.1 81,830 23.2 Total operating expenses 412,675 100.7 359,868 102.0 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses totaled 52.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3.9 million, or 7 , from the comparable prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in sales commissions due to lower revenues generated from certain products that are subject to tiered revenue-sharing agreements. 
 Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expenses totaled 61.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.6 million, or 4 , from the comparable prior year period. The increase was driven primarily by third-party call center support costs associated with the growth of certain BaaS programs within our B2B Services segment, partially offset by lower salary and wages driven by the Headcount Reduction. 
 Processing Expenses Processing expenses totaled 228.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 65.8 million, or 41 , from the comparable prior year period. This increase was principally due to growth in certain BaaS account programs within our B2B Services segment, partially offset by reductions in processor costs realized from the processor migration to our in-licensed card management platform. 
 Other General and Administrative Expenses Other general and administrative expenses totaled 70.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 11.8 million, or 14 , from the comparable prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in transaction losses due to a decrease in the amount of customer dispute volume across our portfolios and favorable reductions in our dispute loss rates, partially offset by higher professional services fees related to our AML program, including improvements to our compliance controls, policies and procedures. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 The following table presents a breakdown of our effective tax rate among federal, state, and other: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 U.S. federal statutory tax rate 21.0 21.0 State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit (8.7) 0.8 Foreign tax rate differential (2.6) (0.5) General business credits (24.4) 2.8 Stock-based compensation (2.6) (7.8) IRC 162(m) limitation (6.3) 5.0 Bank owned life insurance income (13.0) (1.3) Bank owned life insurance surrender (19.2) Nondeductible expenses and penalties 57.5 4.3 Global intangible low-tax income tax 3.0 (3.9) Other (0.1) 0.1 Effective tax rate 4.6 20.5

Table of Contents 

 Our income tax benefit totaled 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 1.6 million income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 1.2 million, or 77 , from the prior year comparable period, primarily due to the impact of the surrender of our existing bank owned life insurance policies, as discussed further below. 
 The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the impact of general business credits, tax benefits from bank owned life insurance policies, and a decrease of 0.4 million in the tax expense associated with shortfalls from stock-based compensation. 
 These decreases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by an increase of 0.9 million in the amount of compensation expense that was subject to the IRC Section 162(m) limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, incremental taxes of 1.1 million and surrender penalties of 0.5 million, and tax expense due to nondeductible expenses and penalties. The increase in nondeductible expenses and penalties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to the tax effect associated with the civil money penalty for the Consent Order. 
 The "Other" category in our effective tax rate consists of a variety of permanent differences, none of which were individually significant. 
 
 Comparison of Consolidated Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Operating Revenues 
 The following table presents a breakdown of our operating revenues among card revenues and other fees, cash processing revenues, interchange revenues and net interest income: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Amount of Total Operating Revenues Amount of Total Operating Revenues (In thousands, except percentages) Operating revenues: Card revenues and other fees 878,002 69.2 735,380 64.8 Cash processing revenues 198,447 15.6 191,925 16.9 Interchange revenues 148,950 11.8 178,950 15.7 Interest income, net 43,453 3.4 29,030 2.6 Total operating revenues 1,268,852 100.0 1,135,285 100.0 
 Card Revenues and Other Fees Card revenues and other fees totaled 878.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 142.6 million, or 19 , from the comparable prior year period. This increase was driven principally by the same factors discussed above under Comparison of Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operating Revenues Card Revenues and Other Fees." 
 Cash Processing Revenues Cash processing revenues totaled 198.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.5 million, or 3 , from the comparable prior year period. Although the number of tax refunds processed decreased by 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our tax processing revenues increased due to a favorable mix-shift in the distribution channel in which the tax refund was processed and from the expansion of our taxpayer advance programs. These increases were partially offset by a 6 decline in the number of cash transfers processed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a lower number of active accounts within our Consumer Services segment, as discussed above in "Overview." 
 Interchange Revenues Interchange revenues totaled 149.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 30.0 million, or 17 , from the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in purchase volume and effective interchange rate earned as discussed under Comparison of Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operating Revenues Interchange Revenues." 
 Interest Income, net Net interest income totaled 43.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.5 million, or 50 , from the comparable prior year period. The increase in net interest income was primarily the result of an increase in cash from deposit programs with our partners and increases in short-term interest rates for the comparable period, as discussed under Comparison of Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operating Revenues Interest Income, net."

 Operating Expenses 
 The following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses among sales and marketing, compensation and benefits, processing, and other general and administrative expenses: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Amount of Total Operating Revenues Amount of Total Operating Revenues (In thousands, except percentages) Operating expenses: Sales and marketing expenses 167,948 13.2 194,530 17.1 Compensation and benefits expenses 189,967 15.0 192,934 17.0 Processing expenses 631,789 49.8 460,555 40.6 Other general and administrative expenses 295,193 23.3 238,324 21.0 Total operating expenses 1,284,897 101.3 1,086,343 95.7 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses totaled 167.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 26.6 million, or 14 , from the comparable prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in sales commissions due to lower revenues generated from certain products that are subject to tiered revenue-sharing agreements, partially offset by higher supply chain expenses, which consist of debit card plastics and related materials costs, due to notifications of terms and conditions we mailed to accountholders in our B2B Services segment. 
 Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expenses totaled 190.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.9 million, or 2 , from the comparable prior year period. The decrease was driven primarily by lower salary and wages as a result of our Headcount Reduction and lower employee stock-based compensation expense, primarily due to a higher number of forfeited awards versus the prior year comparable period. These decreases were partially offset by third-party call center support costs associated with the growth of certain BaaS programs within our B2B Services segment and severance benefits associated with the Headcount Reduction. 
 Processing Expenses Processing expenses totaled 631.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 171.2 million, or 37 , from the comparable prior year period. This increase was driven primarily by the same factors as discussed above under Comparison of Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Operating Expenses Processing Expenses." 
 Other General and Administrative Expenses Other general and administrative expenses totaled 295.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 56.9 million, or 24 , from the comparable prior year period. This increase was primarily due to penalties paid under the Consent Order and higher professional services fees related to our AML program, including improvements to our compliance controls, policies and procedures. Other general and administrative expenses also increased due to an increase in overall transaction losses attributable to an increase in the amount of customer dispute volume across our portfolios, and the settlement payment and impairment charges related to internal-use software and other related assets associated with the termination of our partnership agreement to develop a new core banking system, as previously disclosed during the first quarter of 2024.

 Our income tax expense totaled 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 10.4 million income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 9.0 million, or 87 , from the prior year comparable period, primarily due to a decrease in our year-to-date taxable income. 
 The decrease in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the prior year comparable period was primarily due to a decrease in state income tax expense, net of federal benefits, the impact of general business credits, tax benefits from bank owned life insurance policies, and a reduction of 1.6 million in the amount of compensation expense that was subject to the IRC Section 162(m) limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. 
 These decreases in our effective tax rate were partially offset by an increase of 0.2 million in the tax expense associated with shortfalls from stock-based compensation, an increase in tax expense due to nondeductible expenses and penalties, and a tax charge of 1.5 million and a surrender penalty of 0.7 million. The increase in nondeductible expenses and penalties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily related to the tax effect associated with the civil money penalty for the Consent Order.

 Segment Results 
 Consumer Services 
 The results of operations and key metrics of our Consumer Services segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 Segment revenues within Consumer Services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 20.2 million, or 17 , and 91.9 million, or 24 , respectively, from the prior year comparable periods, while our segment expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 17.1 million, or 23 , and 59.5 million, or 24 , respectively. 
 Our gross dollar volume, number of active accounts, number of direct deposit active accounts and purchase volume each decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 14 , 18 , 15 and 18 , respectively, from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to each of the several factors discussed above in "Overview." These factors include macro-economic factors leading to economic challenges for consumers and other competitive trends that have impacted acquisition at retail locations, our decision to wind-down many of our legacy accountholder programs in support of GO2bank, as well as the non-renewal of one of our retail partner programs, as previously disclosed. Our gross dollar volume and purchase volume decreased year-over-year by similar levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for the same reasons discussed above. As a result of these decreases in each of our key metrics, our monthly maintenance fee revenues, new card fee revenues, ATM fee revenues and interchange revenues decreased year-over-year. In addition, our interchange rate declined due to a mix-shift toward categories of consumer purchases with lower effective rates, as well as a decrease in breakage revenue on our gift card portfolios for each of the comparable periods. 
 Consumer Services segment expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the comparable prior year periods due to several factors, including a decrease in sales commissions from lower revenues on products subject to tiered revenue-sharing agreements, and a decrease in processing expenses from lower volumes in this segment, as well as our processor migration, as discussed above in "Overview." Transactions losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the prior year 
 37

 comparable periods, attributable to a decrease in the amount of customer dispute volume across our portfolios in this segment and favorable reductions in our dispute loss rates. Overall, segment profit decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 7 and 23 , respectively, from the prior year comparable periods. 
 B2B Services 
 The results of operations and key metrics of our B2B Services segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 Segment revenues within our B2B Services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 77.2 million, or 39 , and 218.5 million, or 40 , respectively, compared to the prior year periods, while our segment expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 68.3 million, or 38 and 212.2 million, or 43 , respectively. 
 Our gross dollar volume, number of active accounts and purchase volume each increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 46 , 11 and 10 , respectively, from the prior year comparable period. We have continued to experience organic growth from both new and existing users concentrated in certain BaaS programs that tend to yield higher gross dollar volume per active user but do not generate comparable levels of interchange fees. The growth in gross dollar volume from these BaaS programs resulted in a net increase in segment revenue due to higher program management service fees earned from these BaaS partners. This increase was partially offset by the non-renewals of certain other BaaS partners, as previously disclosed. Our gross dollar volume and purchase volume increased year-over-year by similar levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for the same reasons discussed above. 
 B2B Services segment expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable prior year periods, principally due to higher processing expenses with the growth of certain BaaS account programs, as well as higher third-party call center support costs as a result of an increase in gross dollar volume and the number of active accounts. Transaction losses decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to favorable reductions in our dispute loss rates, and increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on a year over year basis. Overall, our segment profit increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 47 and 11 , respectively, from the prior year comparable periods. This segment also experienced margin compression during each period because certain BaaS

 partnerships are structured based on a fixed profit and, therefore, our segment profit for certain arrangements will not scale with revenue growth. 
 Money Movement Services 
 The results of operations and key metrics of our Money Movement Services segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 Segment revenues within our Money Movement services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.2 million, or 1 , and increased 7.7 million, or 4 , respectively, from the comparable prior year periods. Segment expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.1 million, or 1 , and 2.5 million, or 3 , respectively. 
 The decrease in segment revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by lower cash transfer revenues. Our cash transfer revenues decreased from the comparable prior year period primarily due to a 1 decrease in the number of cash transfers processed during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and an unfavorable mix of cash transfer types and locations where the transactions occurred, as the fees we receive vary depending on these factors. Our tax processing revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained consistent year over year. Due to the seasonal nature of our tax products and services, substantially all of our tax processing revenues are earned during the first half of each year. 
 The increase in segment revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by an increase in our tax processing revenues, partially offset by a decrease in cash transfer revenues. While the number of tax refunds processed decreased by 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our tax processing revenues increased due to a favorable mix-shift in the distribution channel in which the tax refund was processed and from the expansion of our taxpayer advance programs. These increases were partially offset by a 6 decline in the number of cash transfers processed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decline was due to a lower number of active accounts within our Consumer Services segment discussed above. The Green Dot Network is a service provider to accountholders in both our Consumer Services and B2B Services segments, as well as third-party programs. 
 Segment expenses decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily from decreases in sales commissions from lower cash transfer revenues, partially offset by third-party costs and related expenses due to growth across our tax processing services.

 Corporate and Other 
 The results of operations and key metrics of our Corporate and Other segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change (In thousands, except percentages) Financial Results Unallocated revenue and inter-segment eliminations (283) (928) 645 (69.5) 3,095 3,496 (401) (11.5) Unallocated corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations 51,244 49,496 1,748 3.5 167,599 160,257 7,342 4.6 Total (51,527) (50,424) (1,103) 2.2 (164,504) (156,761) (7,743) 4.9 
 Revenues within Corporate and Other are comprised of net interest income, certain other investment income earned by our bank, interest profit sharing arrangements with certain BaaS partners (a reduction of revenue) and eliminations of inter-segment revenues. Unallocated corporate expenses include eliminations of inter-segment expenses and our fixed expenses such as salaries, wages and related benefits for our employees, professional services fees, software licenses, telephone and communication costs, rent, utilities and insurance. These costs are not considered when our CODM evaluates the performance of our three reportable segments since they are not directly attributable to any reporting segment. Non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, impairment charges and other non-recurring expenses that are not considered by our CODM when evaluating our overall consolidated financial results are excluded from our unallocated corporate expenses above. Refer to Note 19 Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for a summary reconciliation. 
 Revenues within our Corporate and Other segment were driven primarily by an increase in net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 92 and 50 , respectively, over the prior year comparable periods, partially offset by the portion of interest shared with certain BaaS partners (a reduction of revenue). Net interest income increased as a result of an increase in cash from deposit programs with our partners and yields earned at the Federal Reserve. 
 Unallocated corporate expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 4 and 5 , respectively, over the prior year comparable periods. The increases were driven primarily from higher professional services fees related to our AML program, including improvements to our compliance controls, policies and procedures, partially offset by lower salary and wages from the Headcount Reduction. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table summarizes our major sources and uses of cash for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in) Operating activities 104,395 132,448 Investing activities 85,818 18,420 Financing activities 576,878 (255,278) Increase (decrease) in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 767,091 (104,410) 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we financed our operations primarily through our cash flows provided by operating activities, and from time to time, our short-term working capital activities through our borrowings under our credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, our primary source of liquidity was unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling 1.5 billion. We also consider our 2.2 billion of available-for-sale investment securities to be highly liquid instruments. 
 We use trend and variance analysis as well as our detailed budgets and forecasts to project future cash needs, making adjustments to the projections when needed. We believe that our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and net proceeds from the issuance and sale of our senior unsecured 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 notes will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, and any other capital needs for at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. We continue to monitor the impact of material trends on our business to ensure our liquidity and capital resources remain appropriate throughout this period of uncertainty. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our 104.4 million of net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of 31.8 million of net losses, adjusted for certain non-cash operating items of 139.5 million and decreases in net changes in our working capital assets and liabilities of 3.3 million, which includes the payment of 44 million for the civil money penalty included in our Consent Order. 
 Our 132.4 million of net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of 30.3 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash operating items of 121.8 million and decreases in net changes in our working capital assets and liabilities of 19.7 million. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Our 85.8 million of net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale securities, net of purchases, of 143.1 million and the surrender of a portion of our bank-owned life insurance policies of 55.1 million, partially offset by capital contributions related to our investment in TailFin Labs, LLC of 35.0 million, the acquisition of property and equipment of 52.2 million and net changes in loans of 24.4 million. Our final payment under our commitment with TailFin Labs, LLC was made in January 2024. 
 Our 18.4 million of net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale securities of 131.8 million, partially offset by capital contributions related to our investment in TailFin Labs, LLC of 35.0 million, the acquisition of property and equipment of 55.5 million and net changes in loans of 21.6 million. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Our 576.9 million of net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was principally the result of a net increase in customer deposits of 547.5 million and in obligations to customers of 46.0 million. Refer to additional discussion below for our borrowings and repayments of debt. 
 Our 255.3 million of net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was principally the result of a net decrease in customer deposits of 238.4 million and a net decrease of 8.8 million in obligations to customers. We also repaid 8.0 million, net of borrowings, on our revolving line of credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Sources of Liquidity 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 In September 2024, we issued and sold senior unsecured notes (the "Notes") in an aggregate principal amount of 45 million. The Notes have a five-year term, maturing September 15, 2029. The principal amounts bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.75 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears. The net proceeds of the offering were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility discussed below, and for general corporate purposes. In October 2024, we issued and sold additional Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 5 million. 
 2019 Revolving Facility 
 In October 2019, we entered into a secured credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and other lenders party thereto. The credit agreement provided for a 100.0 million five-year revolving line of credit (the "2019 Revolving Facility"), which matured in October 2024. The proceeds of any borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Facility were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the credit agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the then-outstanding balance on the 2019 Revolving Facility was repaid in full, and the 2019 Revolving Facility terminated at its maturity date.

 Material Cash Requirements 
 While the overall macro-economic environment, the effect of high inflation and interest rates, and other factors described in "Outlook and Other Trends Affecting Our Business" above have created economic uncertainty and impacted how we manage our liquidity and capital resources, we anticipate that we will continue to develop and invest in property, equipment and internal-use software as necessary in the normal course of our business. The amount and timing of these payments and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business and our business outlook as a result of macro-economic uncertainties. We intend to continue to invest in new products and programs, including GO2bank, new features for our existing products and IT infrastructure in order to scale and operate effectively to meet our strategic objectives. We expect our capital expenditures in 2024 to be lower compared to our capital expenditures in 2023, but at similar levels compared to our annual investments in recent years. We expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows provided by operating activities. 
 We have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies and we anticipate that we may continue to do so in the future. The nature of these transactions, however, makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements. 
 Additionally, we may make periodic cash contributions to our subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, to maintain its capital, leverage and other financial commitments at levels we have agreed to with our regulators. If another economic relief package is signed into law that provides for substantial additional direct payments and unemployment benefits, we may need to increase the size of our cash contributions to Green Dot Bank to maintain its capital, leverage and other financial commitments. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to our contractual obligations disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Capital Requirements for Bank Holding Companies 
 Our subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System and our primary regulators are the Federal Reserve Board and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. We and Green Dot Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, we and Green Dot Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
 The Basel III rules, which were promulgated by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, provide for risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity standards. Under the Basel III rules, we must maintain a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6 , a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8 and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 . Either or both of Green Dot Corporation and Green Dot Bank may qualify for and opt to use, from time to time, the community bank leverage ratio framework under the Federal Reserve s version of the U.S. Basel III Rules. Under the community bank leverage ratio framework, a qualifying community banking organization may generally satisfy its capital requirements (and capital conservation buffer) under the U.S. Basel III rules provided that it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio greater than 9 and satisfies other applicable conditions. Green Dot Corporation and Green Dot Bank qualify for and opt into use of the community bank leverage ratio framework. We expect that Green Dot Corporation will continue to qualify for and use the community bank leverage ratio framework, and that Green Dot Bank will calculate and disclose its risk-based capital ratios and Tier 1 leverage ratio under standardized approach of the U.S. Basel III Rules. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we and Green Dot Bank were categorized as "well capitalized" under applicable regulatory standards. To be categorized as "well capitalized," we and Green Dot Bank must maintain specific total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since September 30, 2024 which management believes would have changed our category as "well capitalized." 
 The definitions associated with the amounts and ratios below are as follows: 
 Ratio Definition Tier 1 leverage ratio 
 Tier 1 capital divided by average total assets 
 Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio 
 Common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets 
 Tier 1 capital ratio 
 Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets 
 Total risk-based capital ratio 
 Total capital divided by risk-weighted assets 
 Terms Definition Tier 1 capital and Common equity Tier 1 capital Includes common stock and retained earnings, adjusted for items primarily related to accumulated OCI, goodwill, deferred tax assets and intangibles. 
 Total capital 
 Tier 1 capital plus supplemental capital items such as the allowance for credit losses, subject to certain limits 
 Average total assets 
 Average total consolidated assets during the period less deductions and adjustments primarily related to goodwill, deferred tax assets and intangibles assets 
 Risk-weighted assets 
 Represents the amount of assets or exposure multiplied by the standardized risk weight ) associated with that type of asset or exposure. The standardized risk weights are prescribed in the bank capital rules and reflect regulatory judgment regarding the riskiness of a type of asset or exposure

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the potential for economic losses from changes in market factors such as foreign currency exchange rates, credit, interest rates and equity prices. We believe that we have limited exposure to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. We have no significant foreign operations. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Interest rates 
 While operating net interest income is a meaningful component to our consolidated operating results, we do not consider our investment portfolio to be subject to material interest rate risk since it is comprised predominantly of fixed rate securities. The composition of our portfolio is price sensitive to rate changes, which can impact unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio. However, we have the ability, liquidity and intent to hold these instruments until such securities in our portfolio recover their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity. Our cash and cash equivalents are also subject to changes in short-term rates. The Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") decreased the federal funds target rate in September 2024 to a range of 4.75 -5.0 , the first rate cut in over four years, and further reduced interest rates by an additional 25 basis points in early November 2024. Although the general market consensus is that interest rates will gradually decrease further over the near term, there remains a possibility that an elevated interest rate environment may persist for the foreseeable future. The FOMC's decision-making policies for short-term interest rates will continue to impact the amount of net interest income we earn in the future. In addition, certain of our BaaS partner arrangements allow for the BaaS partner to share in a significant portion of the interest earned from accountholder deposits (which are recorded as a reduction of revenue) and yields on our investment portfolio tend to lag interest rate increases as securities mature and proceeds are reinvested. Accordingly, the net effect has had and we expect may continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In September and October 2024, we issued and sold Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 50 million. The principal amounts of the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.75 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears and maturing in September 2029. Refer to Note 9 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information. Should we require additional liquidity, our borrowings are expected to be at then current market rates of interest and may expose us to interest rate risk. Although any short-term borrowings would likely be insensitive to interest rate changes, interest expense on short-term borrowings will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short-term interest rates. 
 We actively monitor our interest rate exposure and our objective is to reduce, where we deem appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates. In order to accomplish this objective, we may enter into derivative financial instruments, such as forward contracts and interest rate hedge contracts only to the extent necessary to manage our exposure. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Inflation risks 
 It is difficult to assess whether inflation has or will have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, if our borrowing rates were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through rate increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, interest rate increases may adversely impact our customers spending levels or our customers ability to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. However, we believe this risk is largely offset by the higher interest rate yields on our cash and investment portfolios as well as anticipated increases in consumer spending caused by inflation that would result in increased interchange revenue. Further, because the majority of our investment portfolio is subject to longer maturity dates, we believe the risk of realized losses from selling fixed income securities at a discount to the market is immaterial. 
 Credit and liquidity risks 
 We are exposed to credit and liquidity risks associated with the financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, available-for-sale investment securities, settlement assets due from retail distributors, third-party payment processors and other partners that collect funds and fees from our customers, and amounts due from our issuing banks for fees collected on our behalf. 
 We manage the credit and liquidity risks associated with our cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale investment securities, loans and amounts due from issuing banks by maintaining an investment policy that restricts our correspondent banking relationships to approved, well capitalized institutions and restricts investments to highly liquid, low credit risk assets. Our policy has limits related to liquidity ratios, the concentration that we may have with 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 a single institution or issuer and effective maturity dates as well as restrictions on the type of assets that we may invest in. The management Asset Liability Committee is responsible for monitoring compliance with our Capital Asset Liability Management policy and related limits on an ongoing basis, and reports regularly to the risk committee of our Board of Directors. 
 Our exposure to credit risk associated with settlement assets is mitigated due to the short time period, currently an average of two days that settlement assets are outstanding. We perform an initial credit review and assign a credit limit to each new retail distributor, third-party payment processors and other partners. We monitor each partner's settlement asset exposure and its compliance with its specified contractual settlement terms on a daily basis and assess their credit limit and financial condition on a periodic basis. Our management's Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for monitoring partner exposure and assigning credit limits and reports regularly to the risk committee of our Board of Directors. We continue to monitor our exposure to credit risk with our retail distributors and other business partners in light of the current macro-economic uncertainties. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 13d-15(e)) at the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, at the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Change in internal control over financial reporting There was no material change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced a ny significant impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most of our employees have shifted to a remote workforce strategy in the U.S. The design of our processes and controls allows for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. We are continually monitoring and assessing our remote work environment to minimize the impact, if any, on the design and operating effectiveness on our internal controls. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

 PART II 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Refer to Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for information regarding our legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 
 The loss of operating revenues from our BaaS partners and Walmart or any of our largest retail distributors as well as third-party processors or other major consumers would adversely affect our business. 
 A significant portion of our operating revenues are derived from our BaaS partners and the products and services sold at our largest retail distributors. Approximately 59 and 53 of our total operating revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, was generated from a single BaaS partner. Additionally, as a percentage of total operating revenues, operating revenues derived from products and services sold at the store locations of Walmart was approximately 10 for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We expect that Walmart will continue to have a significant impact on our operating revenues in future periods, particularly in our Consumer Services segment. It would be difficult to replace Walmart and the operating revenues derived from products and services sold at their stores. Accordingly, the loss of Walmart or any significant decrease in customers spending levels and ability or willingness to purchase our account products through Walmart, for any reason, including inflation, would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our large retail distributors, significant BaaS partner or third-party processors could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain consumers, BaaS partners, third-party processors and other retail distributors, and could lessen our negotiating power with our remaining and prospective retail distributors, BaaS partners and third-party processors. 
 The term of our Walmart MoneyCard agreement (which governs the MoneyCard program) expires on January 31, 2027, unless renewed under its automatic renewal provision, which provides for a one-year extension. Our contracts with Walmart and our other largest retail distributors can in limited circumstances, such as our material breach or insolvency or, in the case of Walmart, our failure to meet agreed-upon service levels, certain changes in control, and our inability or unwillingness to agree to requested pricing changes, be terminated by these retail distributors on relatively short notice. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our relationships with our largest retail distributors, significant BaaS partner or third-party processors on the same or more favorable terms in future periods or that our relationships will continue beyond the terms of our existing contracts with them. Our operating revenues and results of operations could suffer if, among other things, any of our retail distributors, significant BaaS partners or third-party processors renegotiates, terminates or fails to renew, or to renew on similar or favorable terms, its agreement with us or otherwise chooses to modify the level of support it provides for our products. 
 Our base of tax preparation partners is concentrated, and the performance of our Money Movement Services segment depends in part on our ability to retain existing partners. 
 If one or more of our major tax preparation partners were to substantially reduce or stop offering our services to their customers, our tax refund processing services business, a component of our Money Movement Services segment, would be harmed. Substantially all the revenues we generate from our tax refund processing services business have come from sales through a relatively small number of tax preparation firms. We do not have long-term contractual commitments from most of our current tax preparation partners and our tax preparation partners for any reason may elect to not renew their contracts with us with little or no advance notice. As a result, we cannot be certain that any of our current tax preparation partners will continue to partner with us past the terms in their current agreements. A termination of our relationships with certain tax preparation partners that provide commercial tax preparation software would result in lost revenue and the loss of the ability to secure future relationships with new or existing tax preparation firms that use such tax software. 
 Our future success depends upon the active and effective promotion of our products and services by our BaaS partners, retail distributors and tax preparation partners. 
 Most of our operating revenues are derived from platform management fees that we earn from our BaaS partners and products and services sold at the stores of our retail distributors. In addition, the revenues we generate from our tax refund processing services are largely derived from products and services sold through retail tax preparation businesses and income tax software providers. Revenues from our BaaS partners, retail distributors 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 and tax preparation partners depend on a number of factors outside our control and may vary from period to period. Our platform management fees depend upon the success of our BaaS partners' efforts to promote their own products and services which incorporate our products and services. Additionally, because we compete with many other providers of products and services for placement and promotion of products in the stores of our retail distributors or in conjunction with the delivery of tax preparation services by our tax preparation providers, our success depends on the willingness of our retail distributors and tax preparation partners to promote our products and services successfully. In general, our contracts with these third parties allow them to exercise significant discretion over the placement and promotion of our or their products and services, and for a variety of reasons they could give higher priority to other products or services they are offering or the products and services of other companies. Accordingly, losing the commitment of our BaaS partners, retail distributors and tax preparation partners might limit or reduce platform management fees and the sales of our products and services. Our operating revenues and operating expenses may also be negatively affected by the operational decisions of our BaaS partners, retail distributors and tax preparation partners. For example, if a retail distributor reduces shelf space for our products or implements changes in its systems that disrupt the integration between its systems and ours, our product sales could be reduced or decline, and we may incur additional merchandising costs to ensure our products are appropriately stocked. Similarly, for a variety of reasons, many of our tax preparation partners that provide commercial income tax preparation software offer their customers several alternatives for tax refund processing services, including those of our competitors. Even if our BaaS partners, retail distributors and tax preparation partners actively and effectively promote our or their products and services, there can be no assurance that their efforts will maintain or result in growth of our operating revenues. 
 Future revenue growth depends on our ability to retain and attract new long-term users of our products. 
 Our ability to increase account usage and accountholder retention and to attract new long-term users of our products can have a significant impact on our operating revenues. We may be unable to generate increases in account usage, accountholder retention or attract new long-term users of our products for a number of reasons, including if we are unable to maintain our existing distribution channels, predict accurately consumer preferences or industry changes and modify our products and services on a timely basis in response thereto, produce new features and services that appeal to existing and prospective customers, and influence accountholder behavior through accountholder retention and usage incentives. Our results of operations could vary materially from period to period based on the degree to which we are successful in increasing usage and retention and attracting long-term users of our products. 
 Seasonal fluctuations in the use of our products and services impact our results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our results of operations and cash flows vary from quarter to quarter, and periodically decline, due to the seasonal nature of the use of our products and services. For example, our results of operations for the first half of each year have been favorably affected by large numbers of taxpayers electing to receive their tax refunds via direct deposit on our accounts, which caused our operating revenues to be typically higher in the first half of those years than they were in the corresponding second half of those years. Our tax refund processing services business is also highly seasonal as it generates the substantial majority of its revenue in the first quarter, and substantially all of its revenue in the first half of each calendar year. To the extent that seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, or are not offset by other factors, our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities could fluctuate materially from period to period. 
 The industries in which we compete are highly competitive. 
 The industries in which we compete are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant changes. We compete against companies and financial institutions across the retail banking, financial services, transaction processing, consumer technology and financial technology services industries, and may compete with others in the market who may in the future provide offerings similar to ours, particularly vendors which provide program management and other services though a platform similar to our banking platform. These and other competitors in the banking and electronic payments industries are introducing innovative products and services that directly compete or may compete with ours. We expect that this competition will continue as banking and electronic payments industries continue to evolve, particularly if non-traditional payments processors and other parties gain greater market share in these industries. If we are unable to differentiate our products and platform from and/or successfully compete with those of our competitors, our revenues, results of operations, prospects for future growth and overall business could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Many existing and potential competitors are entities substantially larger in size, more highly diversified in revenue and substantially more established with significantly more broadly known brand awareness than ours. As 
 48

 such, many of our competitors can leverage their size, robust networks, financial wherewithal, brand awareness, pricing power and technological assets to compete with us. Additionally, some of our current and potential competitors are subject to fewer regulations and restrictions than we are, and thus may be able to respond more quickly in the face of regulatory and technological changes. 
 We are also experiencing competition as a result of relatively new competitors offering free or low-cost alternatives to our products and services. Digital-centric financial services platforms have gained market share through the marketing of their largely free bank account offerings. To the extent these competitors continue to take market share at our expense, we expect that the purchase and use of our products and services would decline. In order to compete across the markets served by our Consumer Services and Money Movement Services segments, we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our retail distributors and our tax preparation partners, or directly to consumers, and decrease the prices of our products and services, any of which would likely adversely impact our results of operations. 
 We may not keep pace with the rapid technological developments in the industries in which we compete and the larger electronic payments industry. 
 The electronic payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. We rely in part on third parties for the development of, and access to, new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to our industry will continue to emerge, and these new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently utilize in our products and services. Additionally, we may make future investments in, or enter into strategic alliances to develop, new technologies and services or to implement infrastructure change to further our strategic objectives, strengthen our existing businesses and remain competitive. However, our ability to develop or transition to new services and technologies may be inhibited by a lack of industry-wide standards, by difficulties encountered in our development of new services and technologies, by resistance from our retail distributors, BaaS partners, third-party processors or consumers to these changes, or by the intellectual property rights of third parties. Investments in new services and technologies or enhancements are inherently risky, and may not be successful or may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our products and services could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 
 Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities using deposit account products (including demand deposit accounts and prepaid cards), reload products, or customer information and may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of Artificial Intelligence. Illegal activities involving our products and services often include malicious social engineering schemes. Fraudulent activity related to tax and other governmental benefits continues to persist at elevated levels. This transaction fraud has negatively impacted and is expected to continue to impact many financial services companies including us in relation to our products. 
 Illegal activities may also include fraudulent payment or refund schemes and identity theft. We rely upon third parties for transaction processing services, which subjects us and our customers to risks related to the vulnerabilities of those third parties. A single significant incident of fraud, or increases in the overall level of fraud, involving our deposit account products, and other products and services, have in the past and could in the future, result in reputational damage to us in addition to losses. Such damage could reduce the use and acceptance of our deposit account products and other products and services, cause retail distributors to cease doing business with us, or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs. Fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions, including significant monetary fines, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 To address the challenges that we face with respect to fraudulent activity, we have implemented risk control mechanisms that have made it more difficult for all customers, including legitimate customers, to obtain and use our products and services. We believe it is likely that our risk control mechanisms may continue to adversely affect our new account and card activations for the foreseeable future and that our operating revenues may be negatively impacted as a result. Further, implementing such risk control mechanisms can be costly and has and may continue to negatively impact our operating margins as we continuously seek to enhance our risk controls. 
 We are exposed to losses from customer accounts. 
 Fraudulent activity involving our products may lead to customer disputed transactions, for which we may be liable under banking regulations and payment network rules. Our fraud detection and risk control mechanisms may not prevent all fraudulent or illegal activity. To the extent we incur losses from disputed transactions, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, our

 accountholders can incur charges in excess of the funds available in their accounts, and we may become liable for these overdrafts. We offer an optional overdraft protection program service on certain demand deposit account programs that allows eligible accountholders who opt-in to spend up to a pre-authorized amount in excess of their available account balance. For accountholders who are not enrolled or do not meet the eligibility requirements of our overdraft protection program, we generally decline authorization attempts for amounts that exceed the available accountholder s balance, however, the application of card association rules, the timing of the settlement of transactions and the assessment of the account s monthly maintenance fee, among other things, can still result in overdrawn accounts. Our overdraft exposure in these instances arises primarily from late-posting. A late-post occurs when a merchant posts a transaction within a payment network-permitted time frame, but subsequent to our release of the authorization for that transaction, as permitted by card association rules. Under card association rules, we may be liable for the transaction amount even if the accountholder has made additional purchases in the intervening period and funds are no longer available in the account at the time the transaction is posted. 
 We maintain reserves to cover the risk that we may not recover these amounts due from our accountholders, but our exposure may increase above these reserves for a variety of reasons, including our failure to predict the actual recovery rate accurately. To the extent we incur losses from overdrafts above our reserves or we determine that it is necessary to increase our reserves substantially, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We face settlement risks from our retail distributors and banking partners, which may increase during an economic recession. 
 A large portion of our business is conducted through retail distributors that sell our products and services to consumers at their store locations or other banking partners that collect funds and fees from our customers on our behalf. Our retail distributors and banking partners collect funds from the consumers who purchase our products and services and then must remit these funds directly to our subsidiary bank. While the remittance of these funds by the retail distributor or banking partner takes on average two business days, we have in the past and may in the future experience lengthy delays. Such delays or refusal to pay exposes us to increased settlement risk. If a retail distributor or other banking partner becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, commits fraud or otherwise fails to remit proceeds to our card issuing bank from the sales of our products and services, we are liable for any amounts owed to our customers. As of September 30, 2024, we had assets subject to settlement risk of 587.1 million. Given the possibility of recurring volatility in global financial markets, the approaches we use to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of our retail distributors or other banking partners may be inadequate, and we may be unable to detect and take steps to mitigate an increased credit risk in a timely manner. Economic recessions could result in settlement losses, whether or not directly related to our business. We are not insured against these risks. Significant settlement losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Worsening economic conditions, high rates of inflation, or other potential causes of economic distress could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results. 
 Global and macro-economic factors have resulted and may continue to result in high inflation rates, interest rates, or unemployment rates, leading to economic challenges for consumers and our retail distributors and other partners as well as reduced transaction and spending volumes on accounts. Additionally, these effects increase the settlement risk from our retail distributors and banking partners and could cause us to experience contraction in the number of locations within our network of retail distributors due to store closures or other developments, with attendant negative impacts to our operating revenues and results of operations. If current market conditions persist or deteriorate, we may decide to adjust pricing to account for an increasing cost of funds and increased credit risk, and thereby erode our margins and negatively impact our future financial performance and the price of our Class A common stock. Additionally, significant inflationary pressure increases borrowing rates, and we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through rate increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, increased interest rates may adversely impact our customers spending levels or our customers ability to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. 
 Please see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information regarding the potential impact of the various market risks on our business. 
 Economic, political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending. 
 The electronic payments industry, including the prepaid and debit card financial services segment within that industry, depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer spending. An economic recession may result in us experiencing a reduction in the number of our accounts that are purchased or reloaded, the number of transactions involving our cards and the use of our reload network and related services. A sustained reduction in the use of our 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 products and related services, either as a result of a general reduction in consumer spending or as a result of a disproportionate reduction in the use of card-based payment systems, would materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We must be able to operate and scale our technology effectively. 
 Our ability to continue to provide our products and services to network participants, as well as to enhance our existing products and services and offer new products and services, is dependent on our information technology systems. If we are unable to manage and scale the technology associated with our business effectively, we could experience increased costs, reductions in system availability and losses of our network participants. Any failure of our systems in scalability and functionality would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We make significant investments in products and services that may not be successful. 
 Our prospects for growth depend on our ability to innovate by offering new, and adding value to our existing, product and service offerings and on our ability to effectively commercialize such innovations. While we will continue to make investments in research, development, and marketing for new products and services, if customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant value, they may fail to accept our new products and services, which would negatively impact our operating revenues. We may not achieve significant operating revenues from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and services may not be as high as the margins we have experienced in the past. 
 Our business could suffer if there is a decline in the use of prepaid cards or demand deposit accounts as a payment mechanism or there are adverse developments with respect to the financial services industry in general. 
 As the financial services industry evolves, consumers may find prepaid financial services or demand deposit accounts to be less attractive than other financial services. Consumers might not use prepaid financial services or demand deposit accounts for any number of reasons, including the general perception of our industry, new technologies, a decrease in our distribution partners willingness to sell these products as a result of a more challenging regulatory environment or other factors outside of our control. If consumers do not continue or increase their usage of prepaid cards or demand deposit accounts, including making changes in the way such products are funded, our operating revenues may decline. Any projected growth for the industry may not occur or may occur more slowly than estimated. If there is a shift in the mix of payment forms, such as cash, credit cards, traditional debit cards and prepaid cards, away from our products and services, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS 
 Our business is dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of computer network systems and data centers, including third party systems. 
 Our ability to provide reliable service to customers and other network participants depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems and data centers as well as those of our retail distributors, network acceptance members and third-party processors. Our business involves the movement of large sums of money, the processing of large numbers of transactions and the management of the data necessary to do both. Our success in our account programs, including our BaaS programs, as well as our money movement services, depends upon the efficient and error-free handling of the money that is collected, remitted or deposited in connection with the provision of our products and services. We rely on the ability of our employees, systems and processes and those of the banks that issue our cards, our retail distributors, tax refund preparation partners, other business partners and third-party processors to process and facilitate these transactions in an efficient, uninterrupted and error-free manner. Their failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our operating revenues and results of operations, particularly during the tax season, when we derive substantially all of our operating revenues for our tax refund processing services and a significant portion of our other operating revenues. 
 Our systems and the systems of third-party processors are susceptible to outages and interruptions due to fire, natural disaster, cyber-attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, software or hardware defects, terrorist attacks, pandemics and similar events. We use both internally developed and third-party systems, including cloud computing and storage systems, for our services and certain aspects of transaction processing. Interruptions in our service may result for a number of reasons. Additionally, the data center hosting facilities that we use could be closed without adequate notice or suffer unanticipated problems resulting in lengthy interruptions in our service. 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 Moreover, as we continue to add cloud based solutions or additional capacity to our existing data centers, we could experience problems transferring customer accounts and data, impairing the delivery of our service. 
 Our technology platforms continue to evolve as we regularly invest in enhancing our systems. As a result, some customers may experience disruptions in service despite significant investments in planning and testing on the part of us and our technology partners. In addition, the implementation of technological changes could cause significant disruptions to our customers and our business and may cause processing errors. 
 Any damage to, or failure of, or delay in our processes or systems generally, or those of our vendors (including as a result of disruptions at our third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud providers), or an improper action by our employees, agents or third-party vendors, could result in interruptions in our service, causing customers, retail distributors and other partners to become dissatisfied with our products and services or obligate us to issue credits or pay fines or other penalties to them. Sustained or repeated process or system failures could reduce the attractiveness of our products and services, including our banking platform, and result in contract terminations, thereby reducing operating revenue and harming our results of operations. Further, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may adversely impact use of our products and services, including our banking platform, and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and business partners. Additionally, some of our contracts with retail distributors, including our contract with Walmart, contain service level standards pertaining to the operation of our systems, and provide the retail distributor with the right to collect damages and to potentially terminate its contract with us for system downtime exceeding stated limits. If we face system interruptions or failures, our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to cover the losses or damages that we incur. In addition, our insurance costs may also increase substantially in the future to cover the costs our insurance carriers may incur. 
 A cyber-attack, incident or security breach could expose us to liability and protracted and costly litigation, regulatory penalties, and could adversely affect our reputation and operating revenues. 
 We and our retail distributors, tax preparation partners, network acceptance members, third-party processors and the merchants that accept our cards receive, transmit and store confidential customer and other information, including personal information, in connection with the sale and use of our products and services. Despite the encryption software and the other technologies and systems we use to provide security for storage, processing and transmission of confidential customer and other information these technologies or systems have been, and continue to be, vulnerable to cyber-attacks, incidents and data security breaches by third parties and we have experienced, and may in the future experience, successful attacks, incidents and breaches. The risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures has been heightened by advances in computer capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers, including state sponsored hackers. Our retail distributors, tax preparation partners, network acceptance members, other business partners, third-party processors and the merchants that accept our cards also may experience similar cyber-attacks, incidents or security breaches or discover securities vulnerabilities involving the receipt, transmission and storage of our confidential customer and other information. Improper access to our or these third parties systems or databases could result in the theft, publication, deletion or modification of confidential customer and other information. 
 A data security breach of the systems on which sensitive accountholder or other customer or end-customer data and account information are stored have led, and could in the future lead, to fraudulent activity involving our products and services, reputational damage and claims, and could lead to regulatory actions, including penalties, against us. Further, a cyber-attack or other incident could go undetected and persist in our systems for extended periods. Regardless of whether or not we are sued or face regulatory actions, a breach will require us to carefully assess the materiality of a cyber-attack or other incident. Depending on the nature and magnitude of the accessed data, this effort may require substantial resources. If we are sued in connection with any data security breach, we could be involved in protracted and costly litigation and might be forced to pay damages and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues and profitability. We would also likely have to pay (or indemnify the banks that issue our products and services which includes cards) fines, penalties and/or other assessments imposed by Visa or Mastercard as a result of any data security breach. Further, a significant data security breach could lead to additional regulation, which could impose new and costly compliance obligations. In addition, a data security breach or perceived security vulnerability at any of the third-party banks that issue our cards or at any of our retail distributors, tax preparation partners, network acceptance members, other business partners, third-party processors or the merchants that accept our cards could result in significant reputational harm to us and cause the use and acceptance of our cards or other products and services to decline, either of which could have a significant adverse impact on our operating revenues and future growth prospects. Moreover, it may require substantial financial resources to address and remediate any such breach, including additional costs for hiring an external party to conduct a forensic investigation, replacement cards, manufacturing, distribution, re-stocking fees, fraud monitoring, and other added security measures, among others, which could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results.

 Additionally, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data security liabilities actually incurred, will cover any indemnification claims against us relating to any incident, that insurance will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The assertion of large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation. 
 Failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protection laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences, civil or criminal penalties and business reputation risk. 
 Complex existing and emerging local, state, and federal laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal information. These privacy laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal information, or to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. 
 Replacing third-party vendors would be difficult and disruptive to our business. 
 Some services relating to our business, including fraud management and other customer verification services, cash processing, card production, and customer service, are outsourced to third-party vendors. We also depend on third-party banks to assist with our tax refund processing services. It would be difficult to replace some of our third-party vendors in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services during the term of their agreements with us or if they elected not to renew their contracts with us, and our business and operations would be adversely affected. Additionally, replacing third-party vendors with in-house solutions may lead to unanticipated operating costs and potential exposure to increased regulatory scrutiny. In particular, due to the seasonality in our business, any material service interruptions, service delays or changes in service contracts with key vendors during the tax season would result in losses that have an even greater adverse effect on that business than would be the case with our overall business. 
 Further, we have in the past and may in the future experience operational issues with the third-party call centers that we rely on to provide customer support. Any prolonged closure or disruption in the services provided by such call centers would have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Some of our operations, including a significant portion of our software development operations, are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to additional risks. 
 A significant portion of our software development operations are based in Shanghai, China. A prolonged disruption at our China facility for any reason due to natural or man-made disasters, outbreaks of disease, climate change or other events outside of our control, such as equipment malfunction or large-scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers, could potentially delay our ability to launch new products or services or impact our ability to deliver current products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Additionally, as a result of our international operations, we face numerous other challenges and risks, including: 
 increased complexity and costs of managing international operations; 
 regional economic and geopolitical instability and military conflicts; 
 limited protection of our intellectual property and other assets; 
 compliance with and unanticipated changes in local laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations; 
 foreign currency exchange fluctuations relating to our international operating activities; 
 local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices; and 
 differing employment practices and labor relations.

 REGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS 
 As a bank holding company, we are subject to extensive and potentially changing regulation and are required to serve as a source of strength for Green Dot Bank. 
 As a bank holding company, we, along with Green Dot Bank, are subject to comprehensive supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and the State of Utah Department of Financial Institutions and must comply with applicable laws and regulations and other commitments we have agreed to, including financial commitments with respect to minimum capital and leverage requirements. If regulators believe that we or Green Dot Bank have not complied with any of these requirements, we may become subject to formal or informal enforcement actions, proceedings, or investigations, which could result in regulatory orders, penalties, restitution, restrictions on our business operations or requirements to take corrective actions, which may, individually or in the aggregate, affect our results of operations and restrict our ability to grow. For example, in July 2024 we and our subsidiary bank received the Consent Order from the Federal Reserve Board relating principally to various aspects of compliance risk management, including consumer compliance and compliance with AML regulations. The Consent Order included a civil money penalty related to these issues in the amount of 44 million which was subsequently paid in July 2024. We previously accrued an estimated liability of 20 million related to the Consent Order during the three months ended December 31, 2023, and the remaining portion was accrued during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Additionally, in response to enhanced regulatory scrutiny, we have increased our investment in our regulatory and compliance infrastructure and will continue with further increases. If we fail to comply with the applicable capital and leverage requirements, or if Green Dot Bank fails to comply with its applicable capital and leverage requirements, the Federal Reserve Board may limit our or Green Dot Bank's ability to pay dividends or fund stock repurchases, or if we become less than adequately capitalized, require us to raise additional capital. In addition, if at any time we or Green Dot Bank fail to be well capitalized or well managed, we may not commence, or acquire any shares of a company engaged in, any activities only permissible for an FHC, without prior Federal Reserve approval. 
 The restriction on our ability to commence, or acquire any shares of a company engaged in, any activities only permissible for an FHC, without prior Federal Reserve approval would also generally apply if Green Dot Bank received a CRA rating of less than Satisfactory. Currently, under the Bank Holding Company Act (the "BHC Act"), we may not be able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses. Such restrictions might limit our ability to pursue future business opportunities which we might otherwise consider, but which might fall outside the scope of permissible activities. U.S. bank regulatory agencies from time to time take supervisory actions under certain circumstances that restrict or limit a financial institution's activities, including in connection with examinations, which take place on a continual basis. We are subject to significant legal restrictions on our ability to publicly disclose the existence of these actions or any of the related details. In addition, as part of the regular examination process, our and Green Dot Bank's regulators may direct us or our subsidiaries to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. Such restrictions may include not being able to engage in certain categories of new activities or acquire shares or control of other companies. 
 The failure by Green Dot Bank to properly classify its deposits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 The FDIC issued a final rule relating to the classification of brokered deposits, with full compliance required in 2022. The final rule established a framework for analyzing certain provisions of the deposit broker definition, including placing deposits, facilitating the placement of deposits and primary purpose, for purposes of the classification of deposits as brokered deposits and exemptions from such a classification. As a result of the final rule, Green Dot Bank reclassified most of its deposits as non-brokered. If our reclassification is deemed non-compliant, we could be subject to regulatory fines and penalties, increased regulatory oversight, restrictions on our activities, and increased litigation risk. 
 Failure by us and our business partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 The banking, financial technology, transaction processing and tax refund processing services industries are highly regulated, and failure by us, the banks that issue our cards or the businesses that participate in our reload network or other business partners to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could negatively impact our business. We are subject to state money transmission licensing requirements and a wide range of federal and other state laws and regulations. In particular, our products and services are subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to protect consumers, such as various disclosure and consent requirements, mandated or prohibited terms and conditions, prohibitions on discrimination based on certain prohibited bases, prohibitions on unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, or to help detect and prevent money 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities. For example, we are subject to the AML reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the BSA, as amended by the PATRIOT Act. Monitoring and complying with all applicable laws, regulations and licensing requirements can be difficult and costly. Failure to fully comply with these requirements exposes us to the risk of being required to undertake substantial remediation efforts and to the risk of, among other things, enforcement actions, lawsuits, monetary damages, fines, penalties and reputational harm, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or business prospects. 
 From time to time, federal and state legislators and regulatory authorities, including state attorney generals, increase their focus on the banking, consumer financial services and tax preparation industries and have in the past and may in the future propose and adopt new legislation or guidance that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for financial institutions and financial services companies. Accordingly, changes in laws and regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof may occur that could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business, require significant systems redevelopment, or render our products or services less profitable or obsolete, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, we could face more stringent AML rules and regulations, as well as more stringent licensing rules and regulations, compliance with which could be expensive and time consuming. In addition, adverse rulings relating to the industries in which we participate could cause our products and services to be subject to additional laws and regulations, which could make our products and services less profitable. Further, with the current administration and leadership at federal agencies such as the CFPB, we expect that financial institutions will remain heavily regulated in the near future and that additional laws or regulations may be adopted that further regulate specific banking practices, including with respect to the fees we are permitted to charge to customers. 
 If additional regulatory requirements were imposed on our bank or the sale of our products and services, the requirements could lead to a loss of retail distributors, network participants, tax preparation partners or other business partners, which could materially and adversely impact our operations. Moreover, if our products are adversely impacted by the interpretation or enforcement of these regulations or if we or any of our retail distributors or tax preparation partners were unwilling or unable to make such operational changes to comply with the interpretation or enforcement thereof, we would no longer be able to sell our products and services through that noncompliant retail distributor or tax preparation partner, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and operating results. 
 Failure by us or those businesses to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could result in fines, penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our business, or federal or state actions, any of which could significantly harm our reputation with consumers, banks that issue our cards and regulators, and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Many of these laws can be unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance with them could be difficult and costly. If new regulations or laws result in changes in the way we are regulated, these regulations could expose us to increased regulatory oversight, more burdensome regulation of our business, and increased litigation risk, each of which could increase our costs and decrease our operating revenues. Furthermore, limitations placed on the fees we charge or the disclosures that must be provided with respect to our products and services could increase our costs and decrease our operating revenues. 
 Changes in rules or standards set by the payment networks, or changes in debit network fees or products or interchange rates, could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 We are subject to association rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for acts or omissions by us or businesses that work with us, including card processors. The termination of the card association registrations held by us or any changes in card association or other debit network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of existing rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide our products and services could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, from time to time, card associations may increase the fees that they charge, which could increase our operating expenses, reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Furthermore, a material portion of our operating revenues is derived from interchange fees. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interchange revenues represented 12 of our total operating revenues, and we expect interchange revenues to continue to represent a significant percentage of our total operating revenues. The amount of interchange revenues that we earn is highly dependent on the interchange rates that the payment networks set and adjust from time to time. 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to implement regulations that have substantially limited interchange fees for many issuers. While the interchange rates that may be earned by us and Green Dot Bank are exempt from the limitations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, federal legislators and regulatory authorities have become increasingly focused on interchange fees, and continue to propose new legislation that could result in significant adverse changes to the rates we are able to charge and there can be no assurance that future regulation or changes by the payment networks will not substantially impact our interchange revenues. If interchange rates decline, whether due to actions by the payment networks or future regulation, we would likely need to change our fee structure to offset the loss of interchange revenues. However, our ability to make these changes is limited by the terms of our contracts and other commercial factors, such as price competition. To the extent we increase the pricing of our products and services, we might find it more difficult to acquire consumers and to maintain or grow card usage and customer retention, and we could suffer reputational damage and become subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. We also might have to discontinue certain products or services. As a result, our total operating revenues, operating results, prospects for future growth and overall business could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Litigation or investigations could result in significant settlements, sanctions, fines or penalties. 
 We are subject to regulatory oversight in the normal course of our business and have been, currently are and from time to time in the future may be subject to securities class actions, commercial and other litigation or regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations. The outcome of litigation and regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations is difficult to predict. Plaintiffs or regulatory agencies or authorities in these matters have sought and may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, seek to have aspects of our business suspended or modified or seek to impose sanctions, including significant monetary fines. For example, in July 2024 we and our subsidiary bank received the Consent Order from the Federal Reserve Board relating principally to various aspects of compliance risk management, including consumer compliance and compliance with AML regulations. The Consent Order included a civil money penalty related to these issues in the amount of 44 million which was subsequently paid in July 2024. We previously accrued an estimated liability of 20 million related to the Consent Order during the three months ended December 31, 2023, and the remaining portion was accrued during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Additionally, the monetary and other impacts of these actions, litigations, proceedings or investigations may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend, settle or otherwise resolve these matters have been and may be significant. Further, an unfavorable resolution of litigation, proceedings or investigations against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. In this regard, such costs could make it more difficult to maintain the capital, leverage and other financial commitments at levels we have agreed to with the Federal Reserve Board and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. If regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations were to be initiated against us by private or governmental entities, adverse publicity that may be associated with these proceedings or investigations could negatively impact our relationships with retail distributors, tax preparation partners, network acceptance members, financial institutions and other lending partners, other business partners and card processors and decrease acceptance and use of, and loyalty to, our products and related services, and could impact the price of our Class A common stock. In addition, such proceedings or investigations could increase the risk that we will be involved in litigation. For the foregoing reasons, any regulatory or judicial proceedings or investigations that are initiated against us by private or governmental entities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or could cause our stock price to decline. Refer to Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information regarding certain of our legal and other proceedings. 
 We may be unable to adequately protect our brand and our intellectual property rights related to our products and services or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. 
 Our brands and marks are important to our business, and we utilize trademark registrations and other means to protect them. Our business would be harmed if we were unable to protect our brand against infringement. We also rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect the intellectual property rights related to our products and services. We currently have 17 issued patents and 1 patent application pending. Although we generally seek patent protection for inventions and improvements that we anticipate will be incorporated into our products and services, there is always a chance that our patents or patent applications could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that an issued patent will not adequately cover the scope of our inventions or improvements incorporated into our products or services. Additionally, our patents could be circumvented by third parties. 
 We may unknowingly violate the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others and, thus, may be subject to claims by third parties. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the mobile technology 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its elements infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. Regardless of the merit of these claims, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to defending against these claims or to protecting and enforcing our own rights. We might also be required to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements and there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. Some of our intellectual property rights may not be protected by intellectual property laws, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. The loss of our intellectual property or the inability to secure or enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend successfully against an infringement action could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL NEEDS AND INDEBTEDNESS 
 We might require additional capital to support our business in the future, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 If our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balances and any cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our future cash requirements, we will need to access additional capital to fund our operations. We may also need to raise additional capital to take advantage of new business or acquisition opportunities. However, we may not be able to raise needed cash in a timely basis on terms acceptable to us or at all. Financings, if available, may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders. The holders of new securities may also receive rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we were to raise cash through a debt financing, the terms of the financing might impose additional conditions or restrictions on our operations that could adversely affect our business. If we require new sources of financing but they are insufficient or unavailable, we would be required to modify our operating plans to take into account the limitations of available funding, which would harm our ability to maintain or grow our business. Should we require additional credit at levels we are unable to access, the cost of credit is greater than expected, or our cost-savings measures are ineffective or result in us incurring greater costs, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
 We have increased debt service obligations as a result of the issuance of our senior unsecured notes. 
 In September and October 2024, we issued and sold senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of 50.0 million that mature in September 2029. As a result of these transactions, we have incurred additional debt service obligations in addition to normal operating expenses and planned capital expenditures. Our increased level of indebtedness may have several important effects on our future operations, including, without limitation, a portion of our cash flow must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on the senior unsecured notes, reducing funds available for distribution to stockholders and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness will be dependent upon our future performance, as well as Green Dot Bank and its ability to pay dividends to us, which will be subject to regulatory restrictions, general economic, industry and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors affecting us and Green Dot Bank, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the senior unsecured notes contain certain affirmative and negative non-financial covenants applicable to us and Green Dot Bank that could limit our ability to take advantage of financing, merger, acquisition or other opportunities, to fund our business operations or to fully implement our current and future operating strategies. 
 We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to generate cash flow at or above its current level and that we will be able to pay principal and interest on the senior unsecured notes as they become due. Further, we cannot assure you that our maintenance of our indebtedness or occurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. 
 GENERAL RISKS 
 Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline. 
 If our quarterly and annual results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our Class A common stock, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our quarterly or annual results of operations might result from a number of factors including the occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in these risk factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to: 
 the timing and volume of purchases and use of our products and services; 
 the timing and volume of tax refunds or other government payments processed by us; 
 the timing and success of new product or service introductions by us or our competitors; 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 fluctuations in customer retention rates; 
 changes in the mix of products and services that we sell or changes in the mix of our client retail distributors; 
 the timing of commencement of new and existing product roll outs, developments and initiatives and the lag before those new products, channels or retail distributors generate material operating revenues; 
 our ability to effectively sell our products through direct-to-consumer initiatives; 
 costs associated with significant changes in our risk policies and controls; 
 the amount and timing of major advertising campaigns, including sponsorships; 
 the amount and timing of capital expenditures and operating costs; 
 interest rate volatility; 
 our ability to control costs, including third-party service provider costs and sales and marketing expenses; 
 volatility in the trading price of our Class A common stock; 
 changes in the political or regulatory environment affecting the industries in which we operate; 
 economic recessions or uncertainty in financial markets, and the uncertainty regarding the impact of inflation; and 
 other factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics as well as the other items included in these risk factors. 
 Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance. 
 From time to time, we issue guidance in our quarterly earnings conference calls, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release. Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will prove to be incorrect or will vary significantly from actual results. Actual results will vary from our guidance and the variations may be material, especially in times of economic uncertainty. 
 Our future success depends on our ability to attract, integrate, retain and incentivize key personnel. 
 Our ability to manage and grow our business will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, integrate, retain and recognize key personnel, namely our management team and experienced sales, marketing and program and technology development personnel. We may experience difficulty in managing transitions and assimilating newly-hired personnel, and if we fail to manage these transitions successfully, we could experience significant delays or difficulty in the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely harmed. Competition for qualified management, sales, marketing and program and technology development personnel can be intense. Competitors have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our top management and employees. In order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we must provide competitive pay packages, including cash and equity-based compensation and the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. Additionally, our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team, work for us on an at-will basis and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. 
 Acquisitions or investments, or the failure to consummate such transactions, could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition. 
 We have in the past acquired, and we may acquire in the future, other businesses and technologies. Identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or successfully complete identified acquisitions. Failure to complete an acquisition could adversely affect our business as we could be required to pay a termination fee under certain circumstances or be subject to litigation, and our stock price may also suffer as the failure to consummate such an acquisition may result in negative perception in the investment community. 
 Further, the process of integrating an acquired business, product, service or technology can involve a number of special risks and challenges, including: 
 increased regulatory and compliance requirements; 
 implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 diversion of management time and focus from operation of our then-existing business; 
 integration and coordination of product, sales, marketing, program and systems management functions; 
 transition of the acquired company s users and customers onto our systems; 
 integration of the acquired company s systems and operations generally with ours; 
 integration of employees from the acquired company into our organization; 
 loss or termination, including costs associated with the termination or replacement of employees; 
 liability for activities of the acquired company prior to the acquisition, including violations of law, commercial disputes, and tax and other known and unknown liabilities; and 
 increased litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims brought by terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties. 
 If we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired business or technology or otherwise address these special risks and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of that acquisition, we might incur unanticipated liabilities, or we might otherwise suffer harm to our business generally. Furthermore, acquisitions and investments are often speculative in nature and the actual benefits we derive from them could be lower or take longer to materialize than we expect. In addition, to the extent we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash, it would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other purposes. Future acquisitions or investments could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or goodwill impairment charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and negatively impact our stockholders. 
 An impairment charge of goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our net goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our consolidated assets. Our net goodwill and intangible assets were 403.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or ("U.S. GAAP"), we are required to test the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or sooner if events occur that indicate impairment could exist, such as a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit s fair value, legal and regulatory factors, operating performance indicators, competition and other factors. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. 
 If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired. 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have in the past and may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. If we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis and might suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violate NYSE listing standards, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and could result in regulatory action, and could require us to restate our financial statements. Any such restatement could result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the SEC. 
 Our business could be negatively affected by actions of stockholders. 
 The actions of stockholders could adversely affect our business. Specifically, certain actions of certain types of stockholders, including without limitation public proposals, requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or special demands or requests, could disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming or divert the attention of our management and employees and increase the volatility of our stock. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of our stockholders may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable and need to make changes, which may be exploited by our competitors and make it more difficult to attract and retain personnel as well as customers, service providers and partners. Actions by our stockholders may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 Our charter documents, Delaware law and our status as a bank holding company could discourage, delay or prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable. 
 Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions under Delaware law, could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock, and result in the trading price of our Class A common stock being lower than it otherwise would be. In addition to the foregoing, under the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, and their respective implementing regulations, Federal Reserve Board approval is necessary prior to any person or company acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company, subject to certain exceptions. Control, among other considerations, exists if an individual or company acquires 25 or more of any class of voting securities, and may be presumed to exist if a person acquires 10 or more of any class of voting securities. These restrictions could affect the willingness or ability of a third party to acquire control of us for so long as we are a bank holding company.
