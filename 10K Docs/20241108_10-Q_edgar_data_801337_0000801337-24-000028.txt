 changes in loan demand or real estate values; 
 changes in the mix of loan geographies, sectors, or types, and the level of non-performing assets, charge-offs, and delinquencies; 
 changes in our estimates of current expected credit losses based upon periodic review under relevant regulatory and accounting requirements; 
 the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices applicable to us, including impacts of recently adopted accounting guidance; 
 legal and regulatory developments, including any due to recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, the resolution of legal proceedings or regulatory or other governmental inquiries, and the results of regulatory examinations or reviews; 
 iii

Factors or events that could cause the Company s actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all of them. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Webster Financial Corporation is a bank holding company and financial holding company under the BHC Act, incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1986, and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. Webster Bank is a leading commercial bank in the Northeast that provides a wide range of digital and traditional financial solutions across three differentiated lines of business: Commercial Banking, Healthcare Financial Services, and Consumer Banking. While its core footprint spans the northeastern U.S. from New York to Massachusetts, certain businesses operate in extended geographies. 
 The following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is necessary to understand the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023. This information should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying Notes thereto, contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements of this report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying Notes thereto, contained in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2023, are not necessarily indicative of future results that may be attained for the entire year or other interim periods.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The non-GAAP financial measures identified in the preceding table provide both management and investors with information useful in understanding the Company s financial position, results of operations, the strength of its capital position, and overall business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for performance measurement purposes, as well as for internal planning and forecasting, and by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties to assess peer company operating performance. Management believes that this presentation, together with the accompanying reconciliations, provides investors with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company s business and allows investors to view its performance in a similar manner. 
 Tangible book value per common share represents stockholders equity less preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets (tangible common equity) divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the reporting period. The tangible common equity ratio represents tangible common equity divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (tangible assets). Both of these measures are used by management to evaluate the Company s capital position. The annualized return on average tangible common stockholders equity is calculated using net income available to common stockholders, adjusted for the annualized tax-effected amortization of intangible assets, as a percentage of average tangible common equity. This measure is used by management to assess the Company s performance against its peer financial institutions. The efficiency ratio, which represents the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, is calculated excluding certain non-operational items in order to measure how well the Company is managing its recurring operating expenses. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis financial measures. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these with other companies that present financial measures having the same or similar names. 
 The following tables reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measures defined by GAAP: At September 30, (Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 Tangible book value per common share: Stockholders equity 9,198,050 8,199,201 Less: Preferred stock 283,979 283,979 Common stockholders equity 8,914,071 7,915,222 Less: Goodwill and other intangible assets 3,212,050 2,843,217 Tangible common stockholders equity 5,702,021 5,072,005 Common shares outstanding 171,428 172,056 Tangible book value per common share 33.26 29.48 Book value per common share (GAAP) 52.00 46.00 Tangible common equity ratio: Tangible common stockholders equity 5,702,021 5,072,005 Total assets 79,453,900 73,130,851 Less: Goodwill and other intangible assets 3,212,050 2,843,217 Tangible assets 76,241,850 70,287,634 Tangible common equity ratio 7.48 7.22 Common stockholders equity to total assets (GAAP) 11.22 10.82

Financial Statements. 
 (2) Strategic restructuring costs and other primarily includes severance, technology contract termination costs, and the partial impairment of the payroll finance customer relationship intangible asset for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (3) Other income (non-GAAP) includes the taxable equivalent of net income generated from LIHTC investments. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the Company s primary source of revenue, representing 91.1 and 89.7 of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 86.7 and 87.6 of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets (i.e., loans and leases and investment securities) and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities (i.e., deposits and borrowings), which are used to fund interest-earning assets and other activities. Net interest margin is calculated as the ratio of FTE net interest income to average interest-earning assets. 
 Net interest income, net interest margin, and average yields and rates on an FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures, and are used by management to evaluate the comparability of the Company s revenue arising from both taxable and non-taxable sources. FTE adjustments are determined assuming a statutory federal income tax rate of 21 . 
 3 

Net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rate levels, re-pricing frequencies, contractual maturities, prepayment behavior, and the use of interest rate derivative financial instruments. These factors are affected by changes in economic conditions, which impacts monetary policies, competition for loans and deposits, as well as the extent of interest lost on non-performing assets. 
 Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
 Net interest income increased 2.7 million, or 0.5 , from 587.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 589.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. On an FTE basis, net interest income decreased 1.5 million. Net interest margin decreased 13 basis points from 3.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 3.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Average total interest-earning assets increased 2.7 billion, or 4.0 , from 67.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 69.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increases of 2.2 billion in average total investment securities, 0.9 billion in average loans and leases, and 0.2 billion in average loans held for sale, partially offset by 0.6 billion in average interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 20 basis points from 5.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.69 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased yields on investment securities. 
 Average total investment securities increased 2.2 billion, or 15.0 , from 14.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 16.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a higher volume of purchases, partially offset by paydown activities and sales of available-for-sale securities. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, the average total investment securities portfolio comprised 24.2 and 21.9 of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on investment securities increased 101 basis points from 3.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 4.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the reinvestment of funds received from the maturities and sales of lower yielding securities for securities at higher yields. 
 Average loans and leases increased 0.9 billion, or 1.6 , from 50.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 51.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate and residential mortgages, partially offset by a decrease in warehouse loans and the transfer of the payroll finance and factored receivables loan portfolios to held for sale in March 2024. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average loans and leases comprised 74.1 and 75.8 of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on loans and leases increased 2 basis points from 6.20 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 6.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion on loans acquired in the Sterling merger. 
 Average loans held for sale were 216.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and comprised 0.3 of total average interest-earning assets at September 30, 2024. The balance primarily reflects the higher yielding payroll finance and factored receivables loan portfolios, which were classified as held for sale in March 2024. Average loans held for sale were not significant for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Average interest-bearing deposits decreased 0.6 billion, or 47.0 , from 1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 0.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the Company s risk management approach to hold higher levels of on-balance sheet liquidity in 2023. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average interest-bearing deposits comprised 0.9 and 1.8 of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits decreased 11 basis points from 5.32 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.21 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the lower target range for the federal funds rate. 
 Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased 2.4 billion, or 3.8 , from 63.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 66.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase of 3.0 billion in average total deposits, partially offset by decreases of 0.4 billion in average FHLB advances and 0.2 billion in average long term debt. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased 35 basis points from 2.14 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to growth in higher cost deposit products.

Average total deposits increased 3.0 billion, or 5.0 , from 59.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 62.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a 4.1 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 1.1 billion decrease in non-interest-bearing deposits. The overall net increase in average total deposits was primarily due to the acquisition of Ametros, and growth in interLINK, interest-bearing checking, and HSA deposits, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest-bearing demand and treasury brokered certificates of deposit. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average total deposits comprised 94.6 and 93.5 of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on deposits increased 40 basis points from 1.96 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to growth in higher cost deposit products, particularly money markets accounts. Average higher cost time deposits as a percentage of average total interest-bearing deposits decreased from 15.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 13.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in treasury brokered certificates of deposit. 
 Average FHLB advances decreased 0.4 billion, or 13.9 , from 2.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the paydown of short-term advances. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average FHLB advances comprised 3.8 and 4.6 of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on FHLB advances increased 9 basis points from 5.34 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.43 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the refinancing of maturities in a higher interest rate environment. 
 Average long-term debt decreased 0.2 billion, or 13.3 , from 1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 0.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due the maturity of the 4.375 senior-fixed rate notes in February 2024. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average long-term debt comprised 1.4 and 1.6 of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on long-term debt decreased 14 basis points from 3.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 3.56 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, also primarily due to the maturity of the 4.375 senior-fixed rate notes in February 2024. 
 Comparison to Prior Year to Date

The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 35 basis points from 5.30 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.65 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to loan growth and increased yields on investment securities. 
 Average total investment securities increased 1.8 billion, or 12.3 , from 14.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 16.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due a higher volume of purchases, partially offset by paydown activities and sales of available-for-sale securities. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, the total average investment securities portfolio comprised 23.9 and 21.7 of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on investment securities increased 92 basis points from 2.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 3.87 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the reinvestment of funds received from the maturities and sales of lower yielding securities for securities at higher yields. 
 Average loans and leases increased 0.7 billion, or 1.3 , from 50.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 51.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate and residential mortgages, partially offset by a decrease in warehouse loans and the transfer of the payroll finance and factored receivables loan portfolios to held for sale in March 2024. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average loans and leases comprised 74.5 and 74.8 of average total interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on loans and leases increased 21 basis points from 6.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 6.23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion on loans acquired in the Sterling merger.

Average loans held for sale increased 115.0 million, or 319.6 , from 36.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 151.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the payroll finance and factored receivables loan portfolios, which were classified as held for sale in March 2024. At September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024, average loans held for sale comprised 0.2 and 0.1 of total average interest-earnings assets, respectively. The average yield on loans held for sale increased 810 basis points from 1.68 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 9.78 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher yields on the payroll finance and factored receivables loan portfolios classified as held for sale. 
 Average interest-bearing deposits decreased 1.3 billion, or 69.9 , from 1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 0.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the Company s risk management approach to hold higher levels of on-balance sheet liquidity in 2023. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average interest-bearing deposits comprised 0.8 and 2.8 of total average interest-earnings assets, respectively. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits held at the FRB increased 27 basis points from 5.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the higher interest rate environment. 
 Average FHLB and FRB stock decreased 102.2 million, or 23.1 , from 442.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 340.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a lower FHLB stock investment required as a result of the decrease in FHLB advances. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average FHLB and FRB stock comprised 0.5 and 0.7 of total average interest-earning assets, respectively. The average yield on FHLB and FRB stock decreased 34 basis points from 5.80 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.46 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also primarily due to the reduction in the required FHLB stock investment. 
 Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased 1.0 billion, or 1.6 , from 64.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 65.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase of 4.0 billion in average total deposits, partially offset by decreases of 2.5 billion in average FHLB advances 0.2 billion in average long-term debt, and 0.1 billion in average federal funds purchased. The average rate on interest-bearing liabilities increased 53 basis points from 1.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.46 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the higher interest rate environment. 
 Average total deposits increased 4.0 billion, or 6.9 , from 57.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 61.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting a 5.4 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 1.4 billion decrease in non-interest-bearing deposits. The overall net increase in deposits was primarily due to the acquisition of Ametros, and growth in interLINK, interest-bearing checking, and time deposits, partially offset by lower savings and non-interest-bearing demand deposits. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average total deposits comprised 94.4 and 89.7 of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on deposits increased 71 basis points from 1.61 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the higher interest rate environment and growth in higher cost deposit products, such as money markets accounts and certificates of deposit. Average higher cost time deposits as a percentage of average total interest-bearing deposits increased from 13.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 14.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a shift in customer preferences from non-interest-bearing demand to higher rate retail certificates of deposit. 
 Average FHLB advances decreased 2.5 billion, or 50.0 , from 5.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the paydown of short-term advances. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average FHLB advances comprised 3.9 and 7.9 of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on FHLB advances increased 38 basis points from 5.09 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the refinancing of maturities in a higher interest rate environment. 
 Average long-term debt decreased 0.2 billion, or 11.9 , from 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 0.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due the maturity of the 4.375 senior-fixed rate notes in February 2024. At September 30, 2024, and 2023, average long-term debt comprised 1.4 and 1.7 of total average interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. The average rate on long-term debt decreased 10 basis points from 3.68 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to 3.58 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also primarily due to the maturity of the 4.375 senior-fixed rate notes in February 2024.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
 The provision for credit losses increased 17.5 million, or 47.9 , from 36.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 54.0 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the impact of the current macroeconomic environment on credit performance, risk rating migration, loan portfolio mix, and organic loan growth. 
 Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
 The provision for credit losses increased 43.8 million, or 38.1 , from 114.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 158.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included a discrete merger-related charge of 6.8 million, which increased the provision for unfunded loan commitments. Excluding this charge, the provision for credit losses increased 37.0 million, primarily due to the impact of the current macroeconomic environment on credit performance, risk rating migration, loan portfolio mix, and organic loan growth.

Segment Reporting 
 The Company has three reportable segments, which reflect its primary differentiated lines of business: Commercial Banking, Healthcare Financial Services, and Consumer Banking. Segment performance is evaluated using PPNR, or PTNR, as appropriate. Certain Treasury activities and other functional divisions, such as information technology, human resources, risk management, bank operations, and the operations of interLINK, as well as amounts required to reconcile non-GAAP profitability metrics to those reported in accordance with GAAP, are included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 
 Effective January 1, 2024, the Company realigned certain of its Business Banking operations to better serve its customers and deliver operational efficiencies. Under this realignment, 1.5 billion of loans and 2.2 billion of deposits were reassigned from Commercial Banking to Consumer Banking. Prior period amounts have been recast accordingly. 
 In addition, with the acquisition of Ametros on January 24, 2024, the Company formed a new reportable segment called Healthcare Financial Services, which includes the aggregated financial information of the HSA Bank and Ametros businesses. 
 The following is a description of the Company s three reportable segments and their primary services at September 30, 2024: 
 Commercial Banking serves businesses with more than 10 million of revenue through its Commercial Real Estate, Equipment Finance, Middle Market, Regional Banking, Asset-Based Lending, Commercial Services, Public Sector Finance, Sponsor and Specialty Finance, Verticals and Support, Private Banking, and Treasury Management business units. 
 Healthcare Financial Services offers consumer-directed healthcare solutions that includes HSAs, health reimbursement arrangements, the administration of medical insurance claim settlements, flexible spending accounts, and commuter benefits.

 Consumer Banking offers consumer deposit and fee-based services, residential mortgages, home equity lines, secured and unsecured loans, debit and credit card products, and investment services to individual consumers and small businesses through its Consumer Lending and Business Banking business units. Consumer Banking operates a distribution network consisting of 196 banking centers and 347 ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services, primarily throughout southern New England and the New York metro and suburban markets.

Financial Condition 
 Total assets increased 4.5 billion, or 6.0 , from 74.9 billion at December 31, 2023, to 79.5 billion at September 30, 2024. The change in total assets was primarily attributed to the following items, which experienced changes greater than 100 million: 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased 1.5 billion, primarily due to timing and seasonal net inflows of deposits; 
 Total investment securities increased 1.1 billion, reflecting a 1.5 billion increase in the held-to-maturity portfolio, partially offset by a decrease of 0.4 billion in the available-for-sale portfolio. The net increase in total investment securities was primarily due to purchases exceeding paydown activities, particularly across the Agency MBS and Agency CMBS categories, partially offset by 1.6 billion in sales of Municipal bonds and notes, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS and Corporate debt; 
 Loans held for sale increased 111.1 million. The 117.6 million balance at September 30, 2024, primarily comprises the Company s payroll finance portfolio, which, along with the factored receivables portfolio, was classified as held for sale in March 2024 upon to Company s initiation of a plan to actively market and sell the portfolios. The factored receivables portfolio was sold during the third quarter of 2024; 
 Loans and leases increased 1.2 billion, primarily due to 8.3 billion of originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, particularly across the commercial non-mortgage and commercial real estate categories, partially offset by net principal paydowns, commercial loan sales, including the sale of the factored receivables portfolio and sale of multi-family loans (securitization), and the classification of the payroll finance portfolio as held for sale; 
 Goodwill and other net intangible assets increased a combined 377.5 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Ametros on January 24, 2024, which resulted in the recognition of 228.2 million in goodwill, a 182.8 million core deposit intangible asset, and a 6.1 million trade name. Offsetting this increase was the 19.7 million customer relationship intangible asset write-off associated with the factored receivables portfolio sale and a 1.9 million impairment loss on the payroll finance customer relationship intangible asset; and 
 Accrued interest receivable and other assets increased 323.8 million. Notable drivers of the change included increases in LIHTC investments, treasury derivative assets, other alternative investments, and miscellaneous receivables. 
 Total liabilities increased 4.0 billion, or 6.0 , from 66.3 billion at December 31, 2023, to 70.3 billion at September 30, 2024. The change in total liabilities was primarily attributed to the following items: 
 Total deposits increased 3.7 billion, primarily reflecting an increase in interest-bearing deposits, as non-interest-bearing deposits remained relatively flat. The net increase in interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to an increase in interLINK money market sweep deposits, higher savings and checking account balances, which were due, in part, to seasonal net inflows, HSA deposit growth, and the addition of Ametros, partially offset by a decrease in brokered certificates of deposit; 
 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings decreased 358.2 million, primarily due to the maturity of a 216.3 million non-callable, fixed repurchase agreement in January 2024, and a change in short-term funding mix. There were no federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024; 
 FHLB advances increased 750.2 million, primarily due to a change in short-term funding mix; 
 Long-term debt decreased 137.9 million, primarily due to the maturity of its 4.375 senior fixed-rate notes on February 15, 2024; and 
 Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased 16.3 million. Notable drivers of the change included an increase in unfunded commitments for LIHTC investments, partially offset by decreases in treasury derivative liabilities, accrued interest payable, and operating lease liabilities. 
 Total stockholders equity increased 0.5 billion, or 5.8 , from 8.7 billion at December 31, 2023, to 9.2 billion at September 30, 2024. The change in total stockholders equity was attributed to the following items: 
 Net income of 590.9 million; 
 Other comprehensive income, net of tax, of 177.3 million; 
 Dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders of 206.6 million and 12.5 million, respectively;

Investment Securities 
 Through its Corporate Treasury function, the Company maintains and invests in debt securities that are primarily used to provide a source of liquidity for operating needs, as a means to manage the Company s interest-rate risk, and to generate interest income. The Company s investment securities are classified into two major categories: available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 
 The ALCO manages the Company s investment securities in accordance with regulatory guidelines and corporate policies, which include limitations on aspects such as concentrations in and types of investments, as well as minimum risk ratings per type of security. In addition, the OCC may further establish individual limits on certain types of investments if the concentration in any such security presents a safety and soundness concern. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had total investment securities of 17.2 billion and 16.0 billion, respectively, with an average risk weighting for regulatory purposes of 14.5 and 17.2 , respectively. The Bank held the entirety of the Company s investment securities portfolio at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. However, the Holding Company may also directly hold investment securities. 
 The following table summarizes the balances and percentage composition of the Company s investment securities: At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 (In thousands) Amount Amount Available-for-sale: Government agency debentures 274,825 3.2 264,633 3.0 Municipal bonds and notes 190,982 2.2 1,573,233 17.6 Agency CMO 43,019 0.5 48,941 0.5 Agency MBS 3,972,180 46.2 3,347,098 37.4 Agency CMBS 2,736,835 31.9 2,288,071 25.5 CMBS 696,810 8.1 763,749 8.5 Corporate debt 629,116 7.3 622,155 6.9 Private label MBS 41,834 0.5 42,808 0.5 Other 9,377 0.1 9,041 0.1 Total available-for-sale 8,594,978 100.0 8,959,729 100.0 Held-to-maturity: Agency CMO 20,753 0.2 23,470 0.3 Agency MBS 3,207,275 37.4 2,409,521 34.1 Agency CMBS 4,365,634 51.0 3,625,627 51.2 Municipal bonds and notes (1)

 (1) The balances at both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, exclude the 0.2 million ACL recorded on held-to-maturity securities. 
 Available-for-sale securities decreased 0.4 billion, or 4.1 , from 9.0 billion at December 31, 2023, to 8.6 billion at September 30, 2024, primarily due to the sale of 1.6 billion in Municipal bonds and notes, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, and Corporate debt securities, which resulted in 81.9 million of net realized losses, 2.6 million of which were attributed to a decline in credit quality, and therefore, have been included in the Provision for credit losses. This decrease was partially offset by purchases exceeding paydown activities, particularly across the Agency MBS and Agency CMBS categories. The average FTE yield on the available-for-sale portfolio was 4.30 and 4.04 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 3.14 and 2.96 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The 116 and 108 basis point increases, respectively, are primarily due to higher interest rates on recent securities purchases, as compared to interest rates on securities with paydown activities or that were sold. 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities were 0.6 billion and 0.8 billion, respectively. The 0.2 billion decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates, as well as net realized losses from sales of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are evaluated for credit losses on a quarterly basis. At both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, no ACL was recorded on available-for-sale securities as each of the securities in the Company s portfolio are investment grade and current as to principal and interest, and their price changes are consistent with interest and credit spreads when adjusting for convexity, rating, and industry differences. As of September 30, 2024, based on current market conditions and the Company s targeted balance sheet composition strategy, the Company intends to hold its available-for-sale securities in unrealized loss positions through the anticipated recovery period.

Held-to-maturity securities increased 1.5 billion, or 21.1 , from 7.1 billion at December 31, 2023, to 8.6 billion at September 30, 2024, primarily due to purchases exceeding paydown activities, particularly across the Agency MBS and Agency CMBS categories. The average FTE yield on the held-to-maturity portfolio was 3.90 and 3.68 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 3.01 and 2.94 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The 89 and 74 basis point increases, respectively, are primarily due to higher interest rates on recent securities purchases, as compared to interest rates on securities with paydown activities. 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, gross unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities were 0.7 billion and 0.8 billion, respectively. The 0.1 billion decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates. Held-to-maturity securities are evaluated for credit losses on a quarterly basis under the CECL methodology. At both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the ACL on held-to-maturity securities was 0.2 million.

Portfolio Concentrations 
 The Company actively monitors and manages concentrations of credit risk pertaining to specific industries and geographies that may exist in its loan and lease portfolio. 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, commercial non-mortgage, commercial real estate, and multi-family loans comprised 75.3 and 75.0 , respectively, of the Company s loan and lease portfolio, with a large portion of the borrowers or properties associated with these loans geographically concentrated in New York City and the proximate areas. 
 The following table summarizes commercial non-mortgage loans by industry, as determined using standardized industry classification codes, which are used by the Company to categorize loans based on the borrower s type of business: At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 (In thousands) Amount Amount Finance 4,269,135 24.5 4,109,280 24.4 Services 2,744,013 15.8 2,928,621 17.3 Communications 1,390,254 8.0 1,166,668 6.9 Manufacturing 1,079,136 6.2 1,163,798 6.9 Healthcare 947,757 5.4 848,867 5.0 Retail Wholesale 855,166 4.9 874,547 5.2 Real Estate 801,700 4.6 815,769 4.8 Transportation Public Utilities 544,562 3.1 547,967 3.3 Construction 413,108 2.4 477,303 2.8 Other 4,365,231 25.1 3,952,655 23.4 Total Commercial non-mortgage 17,410,062 100.0 16,885,475 100.0

 (1) Includes 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion of rent-regulated multi-family loans at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Given the foundational change in office demand driven by the acceptance of remote work options, the commercial real estate market has experienced an increase in office property vacancies following the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, commercial real estate performance across the United States related to the office sector continues to be an area of uncertainty. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s outstanding balance for commercial real estate office loans was 0.9 billion, or 1.7 of total loans and leases. In addition, at September 30, 2024, the Company has established reserves of 56.8 million against commercial real estate office loans. While the Company does anticipate ongoing change in the office sector, management believes that its reserve levels reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio.

Credit Policies and Procedures 
 The Bank has credit policies and procedures in place designed to support its lending activities within an acceptable level of risk, which are reviewed and approved by management and the Board of Directors on a regular basis. To assist with this process, management inspects reports generated by the Company s loan reporting systems related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing loans, and potential problem loans. 
 Commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, and equipment finance loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate and service its debt. Assessment of the borrower s management is a critical element of the underwriting process and credit decision. Once it has been determined that the borrower s management possesses sound ethics and a solid business acumen, current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay obligations, as contracted. Commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, and equipment finance loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower, and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. However, the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected, and the collateral securing these loans, as applicable, may fluctuate in value. Most commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, and equipment finance loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal balance. 
 Commercial real estate loans, including multi-family, are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to those for commercial non-mortgage, asset-based, and equipment finance loans. These loans are primarily viewed as cash flow loans, and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Repayment of commercial real estate loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan, the market in which the property is located, and the tenants of the property securing the loan. The properties securing the Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location, which reduces the Company s exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. All transactions are appraised to determine market value. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. Management periodically utilizes third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio. 
 Consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio. These policies and procedures, coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized loan structures, are spread across many different borrowers, minimizing the level of credit risk. Trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis, and policies and procedures are modified or developed, as needed. Underwriting factors for residential mortgage and home equity loans include the borrower s FICO score, the loan amount relative to property value, and the borrower s debt-to-income level. The Bank originates both qualified mortgage and non-qualified mortgage loans, as defined by applicable CFPB rules. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 
 The ACL on loans and leases increased 52.1 million, or 8.2 , from 635.7 million at December 31, 2023, to 687.8 million at September 30, 2024, primarily due to the impact of the current macroeconomic environment on credit performance, risk rating migration, loan portfolio mix, and organic loan growth, partially offset by net charge-offs. 
 The following table summarizes the percentage allocation of the ACL across the loans and leases categories:

Methodology 
 The Company s ACL on loans and leases is considered to be a critical accounting policy. The ACL on loans and leases is a contra-asset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses that are expected to occur over the life of the asset. Executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the allowance, which is maintained at a level that management deems to be sufficient to cover expected losses within the loan and lease portfolios. 
 The ACL on loans and leases is determined using the CECL model, whereby an expected lifetime credit loss is recognized at the origination or purchase of an asset, including those acquired through a business combination, which is then reassessed at each reporting date over the contractual life of the asset. The calculation of expected credit losses includes consideration of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Generally, expected credit losses are determined through a pooled, collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics. However, if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches that of the collectively assessed pool, it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses. The total ACL on loans and leases recorded by management represents the aggregated estimated credit loss determined through both the collective and individual assessments. 
 Collectively Assessed Loans and Leases . Collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on product type and credit quality, and expected losses are determined using models that follow a PD, LGD, EAD, or loss rate framework. For portfolios using the PD, LGD, and EAD framework, expected credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting, expected loss given the occurrence of a default, and the expected exposure of a loan at default. Summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio. The Company s PD and LGD calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions, historical loss information, loan-level risk attributes, and credit quality indicators. The calculation of EAD follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of a similar segment within the same portfolio. The calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses, the loan s amortization schedule, and prepayment rates. Under the loss rate framework, expected credit losses are estimated using a loss rate that is multiplied by the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date. For each loan segment identified, management applies an expected historical loss trend based on third-party loss estimates, and correlates them to observed economic metrics, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. 
 The Company s models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The development of the reasonable and supportable forecast assumes each macroeconomic variable will revert to long-term expectations, with reversion characteristics unique to specific economic indicators and forecasts. The reasonable and supportable forecast period is two years after which the reversion period is one year. Models use output reversion and revert to mean historical portfolio loss rates on a straight-line basis in the third year of the forecast. 
 The Company incorporates forecasts of macroeconomic variables in the determination of expected credit losses. Macroeconomic variables are selected for each class of financing receivable based on relevant factors, such as asset type and the correlation of the variables to credit losses, among others. Data from the forecast scenario of these macroeconomic variables are used as inputs to the modeled loss calculation. 
 A portion of the collective ACL is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics that are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. Qualitative factors are based on management s judgement of the Company, market, industry, or business specific data including loan trends, portfolio segment composition, and loan rating or credit scores. Qualitative adjustments may be applied in relation to economic forecasts when relevant facts and circumstances are expected to impact credit losses, particularly in times of significant volatility in economic activity. 
 Individually Assessed Loans and Leases . If the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches the risk characteristics of the collectively assessed pool, it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses. Generally, all non-accrual loans and loans with a charge-off are individually assessed. The measurement method used to calculate the expected credit loss on an individually assessed loan or lease is dependent on the type and whether the loan or lease is considered to be collateral dependent. Methods for collateral dependent loans are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell (when the basis of repayment is the sale of collateral), or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. For non-collateral dependent loans, either a discounted cash flow method or other loss factor method is used. Any individually assessed loan or lease for which no specific valuation allowance is deemed necessary is either the result of sufficient cash flows or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost of the asset.

Asset Quality Ratios 
 The Company manages asset quality using risk tolerance levels established through the Company s underwriting standards, servicing, and management of its loan and lease portfolio. Loans and leases for which a heightened risk of loss has been identified are regularly monitored to mitigate further deterioration and preserve asset quality in future periods. Non-performing assets, credit losses, and net charge-offs are considered by management to be key measures of asset quality.

 (1) Percentage represents annualized year-to-date net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans and leases within the comparable category. 
 Comparison to Prior Year Quarter 
 Net charge-offs increased 6.1 million, or 20.9 , to 35.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 29.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in net charge-offs in the commercial non-mortgage and multi-family categories, partially offset by a decrease in net charge-offs in the asset-based lending category. 
 Comparison to Prior Year to Date 
 Net charge-offs increased 31.9 million, or 43.1 , to 106.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 74.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in net charge-offs in the commercial non-mortgage and multi-family categories, partially offset by decreases in net charge-offs in the asset-based lending and commercial real estate categories.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company manages its cash flow requirements through proactive liquidity measures at both the Holding Company and the Bank. In order to maintain stable, cost-effective funding, and to promote overall balance sheet strength, the liquidity position of the Company is continuously monitored, and adjustments are made to balance sources and uses of funds, as appropriate. 
 At September 30, 2024, management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s liquidity position, capital resources, or operating activities. Although regulatory agencies have not issued formal guidance mandating more stringent liquidity and capital requirements, the Company is anticipating a greater focus on the liquidity and capital adequacy of financial institutions in response to the high-profile bank failures that occurred in 2023 and related turmoil in the banking industry. The Company has taken appropriate measures to mitigate the risk that such requirements, if implemented, may have on its business, financial positions, and results of operations. 
 Cash inflows are provided through a variety of sources, including principal and interest payments on loans and investments, unpledged securities that can be sold or utilized to secure funding, and new deposits. The Company is committed to maintaining a strong base of core deposits, which consists of demand, interest-bearing checking, savings, health savings, and money market accounts, to support growth in its loan portfolios. Management actively monitors the interest rate environment and makes adjustments to its deposit strategy in response to evolving market conditions, funding needs, and client relationship dynamics. 
 Holding Company Liquidity. The primary source of liquidity at the Holding Company is dividends from the Bank. To a lesser extent, investment income, net proceeds from investment sales, borrowings, and public offerings may provide additional liquidity. The Holding Company generally uses its funds for principal and interest payments on senior notes, subordinated notes, and junior subordinated debt, dividend payments to preferred and common stockholders, repurchases of its common stock, and purchases of investment securities, as applicable. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank paid 100.0 million and 400.0 million in dividends to the Holding Company, respectively. At September 30, 2024, there was 762.3 million of retained earnings available for the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Holding Company. On October 22, 2024, the Bank was approved to pay the Holding Company 200.0 million in dividends for the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 There are certain restrictions on the Bank s payment of dividends to the Holding Company, which can be found within Note 9: Regulatory Capital and Restrictions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements of this report, and in the section captioned Supervision and Regulation in Part I - Item 1. Business of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders remained at 0.40 per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2024. On October 22, 2024, it was announced that the Holding Company s Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.40 per share on Webster common stock. For the Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, quarterly cash dividends of 328.125 per share and 16.25 per share, respectively, were declared. The Company continues to monitor economic forecasts, anticipated earnings, and its capital position in the determination of its dividend payments. 
 The Holding Company maintains a common stock repurchase program, which was approved by the Board of Directors, that authorizes management to purchase shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, and pursuant to any adopted predetermined trading plan, subject to certain conditions. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Holding Company did not repurchase any shares of Webster common stock under the program. At September 30, 2024, the Holding Company s remaining purchase authority was 228.0 million. In addition, the Company will periodically acquire common shares outside of the repurchase program related to employee stock compensation plan activity. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 5,502 shares at a weighted-average price of 45.10 per share, totaling 0.2 million, for this purpose. 
 Webster Bank Liquidity. The Bank s primary source of funding is its core deposits. Including time deposits, the Bank had a loan to deposit ratio of 80.5 and 83.5 at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The Bank is required by OCC regulations to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. The adequacy of liquidity, as assessed by the OCC, depends on factors such as overall asset and liability structure, market conditions, competition, and the nature of the institution s deposit and loan customers. At September 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulatory liquidity requirements. The Company has designed a detailed contingency plan in order to respond to any liquidity concerns in a prompt and comprehensive manner, including early detection of potential problems and corrective action to address liquidity stress scenarios. 
 26 

Capital Requirements. The Holding Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and/or the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (applies to the Bank only), both the Holding Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated pursuant to regulatory directives. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
 Quantitative measures established by Basel III to ensure capital adequacy require the Holding Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of CET1 Risk-Based Capital, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, Total Risk-Based Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage Capital, as defined in the regulations. At September 30, 2024, both the Holding Company and the Bank were classified as well-capitalized. Management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to quarter-end that would change this designation. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company performed a risk-weighted asset optimization analysis of certain of its loan portfolios and off-balance sheet commitments to determine eligibility for reduced risk-weighting. As a result of this analysis, the Company experienced a reduction in risk-weighted assets of approximately 2.1 billion, which, in turn, resulted in increases to its CET1 Risk-Based Capital, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios of 41, 43, and 51 basis points, respectively, at September 30, 2024. 
 In accordance with regulatory capital rules, the Company elected an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of CECL on its regulatory capital over a two-year deferral period, which ended on January 1, 2022, and subsequent three-year transition period ending on December 31, 2024. During the three-year transition period, capital ratios will phase out the aggregate amount of the regulatory capital benefit provided from the delayed CECL adoption in the initial two years. For 2024, the Company is allowed 25 of the regulatory capital benefit as of December 31, 2021, with full absorption occurring in 2025. At September 30, 2024, the regulatory capital benefit allowed from the delayed CECL adoption resulted in a 3, 3, 3, and 2 basis point increase to the Holding Company s and the Bank s CET1 Risk-Based Capital, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, Total Risk-Based Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage Capital, respectively. Both the Holding Company s and the Bank s regulatory ratios remain in excess of being well-capitalized, even without the regulatory capital benefit of the delayed CECL adoption impact. 
 Additional information regarding the required regulatory capital levels and ratios applicable to the Holding Company and the Bank can be found within Note 9: Regulatory Capital and Restrictions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements.

Sources and Uses of Funds 
 Sources of Funds. Deposits are the primary source of cash flows for the Bank s lending activities and general operational needs. Loan and securities repayments, proceeds from sales of loans and securities held for sale, and maturities also provide cash flows. While scheduled loan and securities repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, prepayments and other deposit inflows are influenced by economic conditions and prevailing interest rates, the timing of which are inherently uncertain. Additional sources of funds are provided by both short-term and long-term borrowings, and to a lesser extent, dividends received as part of the Bank's membership with the FHLB and FRB. 
 Deposits. The Bank offers a wide variety of checking and savings deposit products designed to meet the transactional and investment needs of its consumer and business customers. The Bank s deposit services include, but are not limited to, ATM and debit card use, direct deposit, ACH payments, mobile banking, internet-based banking, banking by mail, account transfers, and overdraft protection, among others. The Bank manages the flow of funds in its deposit accounts and interest rates consistent with FDIC regulations. The Bank s Consumer and Digital Pricing Committee and its Commercial and Institutional Liability and Loan Pricing Committee both meet regularly to determine pricing and marketing initiatives. 
 Total deposits were 64.5 billion and 60.8 billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 3.7 billion increase is primarily due to an increase in interLINK money market sweep deposits, higher savings and interest-bearing checking account balances, which were due, in part, from seasonal net inflows, HSA deposit growth, and the addition of Ametros, partially offset by a decrease in brokered certificates of deposit. 
 The following table summarizes daily average balances of deposits by type and the weighted-average rates paid thereon: Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate Non-interest-bearing: Demand 10,243,045 11,335,734 Interest-bearing: Checking 9,744,885 1.96 8,762,995 1.57 Health savings accounts 8,546,941 0.15 8,235,632 0.15 Money market 19,945,165 4.17 17,088,597 3.85 Savings 6,909,526 1.69 6,822,307 0.83 Time deposits 7,190,093 4.51 7,342,757 4.10 Total interest-bearing 52,336,610 2.82 48,252,288 2.44 Total average deposits 62,579,655 2.36 59,588,022 1.96 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Average Balance Average Rate Average Balance Average Rate Non-interest-bearing: Demand 10,327,076 11,775,500 Interest-bearing: Checking 9,475,927 1.89 8,826,074 1.37 Health savings accounts 8,560,303 0.15 8,259,408 0.15 Money market 18,905,798 4.16 15,154,298 3.42 Savings 6,845,957 1.50 7,461,886 0.69 Time deposits 7,508,481 4.60 6,192,415 3.66 Total interest-bearing 51,296,466 2.78 45,894,081 2.02 Total average deposits 61,623,542 2.32 57,669,581 1.61 
 Uninsured deposits represent the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit or similar state deposit insurance regime, and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit accounts that are classified as deposits and not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. The Company calculates its uninsured deposit balances based on the methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting requirements, which includes an estimated portion and affiliate deposits. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, total uninsured deposits as per regulatory reporting requirements and reported on Schedule RC-O of the Bank s Call Report were 22.7 billion and 21.0 billion, respectively.

The following table summarizes uninsured deposits information at September 30, 2024, after certain exclusions: (In thousands) At September 30, 2024 Uninsured deposits, per regulatory reporting requirements 22,745,086 Less: Affiliate deposits (3,877,474) Collateralized deposits (5,677,567) Uninsured deposits, after exclusions 13,190,045 Immediately available liquidity (1)

 (1) Reflects 11.1 billion and 9.2 billion of additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB and the FRB, respectively, and 2.4 billion of interest-bearing deposits held at FRB. 
 Uninsured deposits, after adjusting for affiliate deposits and collateralized deposits, represented 20.4 of total deposits at September 30, 2024. Management believes that this presentation provides a more accurate view of deposits at risk given that affiliate deposits are not customer facing, and therefore are eliminated upon consolidation, and collateralized deposits are secured by other means. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s uninsured deposits as a percentage of total deposits, adjusted for affiliate deposits and collateralized deposits, is consistent with the percentage reported at September 30, 2024. 
 The following table summarizes the portion of U.S. time deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit and time deposits otherwise uninsured by contractual maturity: (In thousands) September 30, 2024 Portion of U.S. time deposits in excess of insurance limit 522,148 Time deposits otherwise uninsured with a maturity of: 3 months or less 251,896 Over 3 months through 6 months 240,689 Over 6 months through 12 months 28,797 Over 12 months 766 
 Additional information regarding period-end deposit balances and rates can be found within Note 6: Deposits in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements. 
 Borrowings. The Bank s primary borrowing sources include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, and long-term debt. Total borrowings were 4.1 billion and 3.9 billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represented 5.2 of total assets. The 0.2 billion net increase is due to an increase of 0.7 billion in FHLB advances, partially offset by decreases of 0.3 billion, 0.1 billion, and 0.1 billion in securities sold under agreements to repurchase, fed funds purchased and long-term debt, respectively. 
 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally a form of short-term funding for the Bank in which it sells securities to counterparties with an agreement to buy them back in the future at a fixed price. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled 0.1 billion and 0.4 billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 0.3 billion decrease is primarily due to the maturity of a 216.3 million non-callable, fixed repurchase agreement in January 2024, along with a change in short-term funding mix. 
 The Bank may also purchase term and overnight federal funds to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Due to a change in short-term funding mix, there were no federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024. Federal funds purchased totaled 0.1 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 FHLB advances are not only utilized as a source of funding, but also for interest rate risk management purposes. FHLB advances totaled 3.1 billion and 2.4 billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 750.2 million increase is primarily due to a change in short-term funding mix. 
 Long-term debt consists of senior fixed-rate notes maturing in 2029, subordinated fixed-to-floating-rate notes maturing in 2029 and 2030, and floating-rate junior subordinated notes maturing in 2033. Long-term debt totaled 0.9 billion and 1.0 billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The 0.1 billion decrease is primarily due to the maturity of its 4.375 senior fixed-rate notes on February 15, 2024. 
 The Bank had additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB of 11.1 billion and 12.5 billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bank also had additional borrowing capacity from the FRB of 9.2 billion and 6.6 billion at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Unencumbered investment securities of 0.4 billion at September 30, 2024, could have been used for collateral on borrowings or to increase borrowing capacity by either 0.2 billion with the FHLB or 0.3 billion with the FRB.

 Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Stock. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 11 district FHLBs, each of which is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. An activity-based capital stock investment in the FHLB is required in order for the Bank to maintain its membership and access advances and other extensions of credit for sources of funds and liquidity purposes. The FHLB capital stock investment is restricted as there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FHLB. The Bank held FHLB capital stock of 131.6 million and 99.0 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The most recent FHLB quarterly cash dividend was paid on November 4, 2024, in an amount equal to an annual yield of 8.36 . 
 The Bank is also required to hold FRB stock equal to 6 of its capital and surplus, of which 50 is paid. The remaining 50 is subject to call when deemed necessary by the Federal Reserve System. Similar to FHLB stock, the FRB capital stock investment is restricted as there is no market for it, and it can only be redeemed by the FRB. The Bank held FRB capital stock of 229.2 million and 227.9 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The most recent FRB semi-annual cash dividend was paid on June 28, 2024, in an amount equal to an annual yield of 4.44 . 
 Uses of Funds. The Company enters into various contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments and that could impact its short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The following table summarizes significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations at September 30, 2024. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may differ from the amounts presented. Based on the Company s current liquidity position, it is expected that our sources of funds will be sufficient to fulfill these obligations when they come due. 
 Payments Due by Period (1) 
 (In thousands) 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Senior notes 300,000 300,000 Subordinated notes 499,000 499,000 Junior subordinated debt 77,320 77,320 FHLB advances 2,700,000 400,000 222 218 9,765 3,110,205 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 100,232 100,232 Time deposits 3,330,154 3,957,088 65,166 33,570 19,819 14,234 7,420,031 Operating lease liabilities 7,092 40,696 36,121 31,489 27,754 87,481 230,633 Contingent consideration 12,500 207 12,707 Royalty liabilities 8,678 1,560 10,238 Total contractual obligations 6,158,656 4,399,551 101,287 65,281 47,791 987,800 11,760,366 
 (1) Interest payments on borrowings have been excluded. 
 In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company offers financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and commercial and standby letters of credit, which involve, to a varying degree, elements of credit risk. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially funded, the total commitment amount of 12.6 billion at September 30, 2024, does not necessarily reflect future cash payments. 
 30 

The Company also enters into commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds and tax credit structures to assist the Bank in meeting its responsibilities under the CRA. The total unfunded commitment for these alternative investments was 818.4 million at September 30, 2024. However, the timing of capital calls cannot be reasonably estimated, and depending on the nature of the contract, the entirety of the capital committed by the Company may not be called. 
 Pension obligations are funded by the Company, as needed, to provide for participant benefit payments as it relates to the Company s frozen, non-contributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan. Decisions to contribute to the defined benefit pension plan are made based upon pension funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act, the maximum amount deductible under the Internal Revenue Code, the actual performance of plan assets, and trends in the regulatory environment. The Company does not currently anticipate that it will be required to contribute to the defined benefit pension plan in 2024. The Company s non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans and other post-employment benefit plans are unfunded. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of 13.9 million and 6.6 million of accrued interest and penalties, respectively. The ultimate timing and amount of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. 
 On November 29, 2023, the FDIC published a final rule implementing a special assessment for certain banks to recover losses incurred by protecting uninsured depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank upon their failure in March 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company s accrual for its estimated special assessment charge was 45.7 million, which is anticipated to be collected over a remainder of eight quarterly assessment periods. The FDIC retains the right to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period, and impose shortfall special assessments if actual losses exceed the amounts collected. The Company continues to monitor the estimated loss attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which could impact the amount of its accrued liability. 
 In connection with the completion of a multi-family securitization during the third quarter of 2024, the Company assumed an obligation to reimburse, or guarantee, losses incurred by the multi-family securitization trusts of up to 12 of the aggregate UPB of the loans at the time of sale. Essentially, this obligation represents a first credit loss enhancement provided by the Company. Based on the credit quality of the multi-family loans at the time of sale, among other factors, the Company estimated the fair value of its reimbursement obligation to be 3.3 million. However, in the event that value of the assets in the multi-family securitization trusts significantly declined, the Company s maximum exposure to loss could be 36.4 million. 
 Additional information regarding credit-related financial instruments, the FDIC special assessment, alternative investments, and the multifamily securitization can be found within Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies, Note 10: Variable Interest Entities, and Note 2: Business Developments, respectively, in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1.

Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk 
 An effective asset/liability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both short-term and long-term interest rate risk when determining the Company s strategy and action. To facilitate this process, interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Company s ALCO, whose primary goal is to manage interest rate risk and maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments. The ALCO meets frequently to make decisions on the Company s investment and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook, its interest rate expectations, the risk position, and other factors. 
 Four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk: 
 the size, duration, and credit risk of the investment portfolio; 
 the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio; 
 interest rate contracts; and 
 the pricing and structure of loans and deposits. 
 The Company measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis and asset/liability modeling software to calculate the earnings at risk and equity at risk. Essentially, interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion, and the net interest income results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate base scenario. The flat rate base scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelve-month forecast horizon. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the flat rate base scenario assumed a federal funds rate of 5.00 and 5.50 , respectively. The federal funds rate target range was 4.75-5.00 at September 30, 2024, and 5.25-5.50 at December 31, 2023, respectively. Further, in the third quarter of 2024, other key model assumptions related to loan prepayment speeds, deposit beta, and average lives were updated based on the most recent studies. While these updates partially contributed to a change in asset/liability sensitivities, the overall impact to net interest income was not material. 
 The following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of up and down 100, 200, and 300 basis points might have on the Company s net interest income over a twelve-month period starting at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, as compared to actual net interest income and assuming no changes in interest rates: 
 -300bp -200bp -100bp +100bp +200bp +300bp September 30, 2024 (2.0) (0.7) 0.2 0.3 0.5 December 31, 2023 (7.2) (4.5) (2.0) 1.7 3.3 5.4 
 Asset sensitivity in terms of net interest income decreased at September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to changes in the overall balance sheet composition, which included an increase in fixed-rate investment securities as a result of securities repositioning in 2024, and an increase in higher cost deposit products, such as interLINK money market sweep deposits, certificates of deposit, and online savings. 
 The following table summarizes the estimated impact that yield curve twists or immediate non-parallel changes in interest rates of up and down 50 and 100 basis points might have on the Company s net interest income over a twelve-month period starting at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023: 
 Short End of the Yield Curve Long End of the Yield Curve -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp -100bp -50bp +50bp +100bp September 30, 2024 2.1 1.1 (0.8) (1.7) (2.3) (1.1) 1.0 2.0 December 31, 2023 (1.8) (0.8) 0.4 0.7 (2.3) (1.1) 1.1 2.2 
 These non-parallel scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down 50 and 100 basis points, while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged, and vice versa. The short end of the yield curve is defined as terms less than eighteen months, and the long end of the yield curve is defined as terms greater than eighteen months. The results reflect the annualized impact of immediate interest rate changes. 
 Sensitivity to the short end of the yield curve for net interest income changed from being asset sensitive to liability sensitive at September 30, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to a change in deposit mix. As discussed above, in 2024, the Company experienced an increase in higher cost deposit products, such as interLINK money market sweep deposits, certificates of deposit, and online savings. In addition, the Company s 2024 securities repositioning resulted in an increase in fixed-rate investment securities, further contributing to decreased asset sensitivity at the short end of the yield curve. Sensitivity to the long end of the yield curve generally remained unchanged from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024. 
 The following table summarizes the estimated economic value of assets and liabilities, and the corresponding estimated change in economic value if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by 100 basis points at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023: 
 (Dollars in thousands) Book Value Estimated Economic Value Estimated Economic Value Change -100bp +100bp September 30, 2024 Assets 79,453,900 74,744,991 2,047,006 (2,182,312) Liabilities 70,255,850 62,938,567 2,247,866 (1,962,062) Net 9,198,050 11,806,424 (200,860) (220,250) Net change as base net economic value (1.7) (1.9) December 31, 2023 Assets 74,945,249 70,356,779 1,297,870 (1,350,496) Liabilities 66,255,253 61,722,480 1,960,088 (1,786,228) Net 8,689,996 8,634,299 (662,218) 435,732 Net change as base net economic value (7.7) 5.0 
 Changes in economic value can best be described through duration, which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates. For fixed-rate financial instruments, it can be thought of as the weighted-average expected time to receive future cash flows, whereas for floating-rate financial instruments, it can be thought of as the weighted-average expected time until the next rate reset. Overall, the longer the duration, the greater the price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates. Generally, increases in interest rates reduce the economic value of fixed-rate financial assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, the economic value of financial liabilities decreases for the same reason. A reduction in the economic value of financial liabilities is a benefit to the Company. Floating-rate financial instruments may have durations as short as one day, and therefore, may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates. 
 Duration gap represents the difference between the duration of financial assets and financial liabilities. A duration gap at or near zero would imply that the balance sheet is matched, and therefore, would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company s duration gap was negative 0.4 years and negative 1.1 years, respectively. A negative duration gap implies that the duration of financial liabilities is longer than the duration of financial assets, and therefore, liabilities have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates at a slower pace. Consequently, the Company s net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise, as the benefit of the decreased value of financial liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of financial assets. The opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall. Earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise, and decrease when interest rates fall over the long term, absent the effects of any new business booked in the future. 
 These earnings and net economic value estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ, and also assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates. Management believes that the Company s interest rate risk position at September 30, 2024, represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook. The Company continues to monitor interest rates and other relevant factors given recent market volatility and is prepared to take additional action, as necessary.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying notes thereto, in accordance with GAAP and practices generally applicable to the financial services industry, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. While management s estimates are made based on historical experience, current available information, and other factors that are deemed to be relevant, actual results could significantly differ from those estimates. 
 Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and can be susceptible to significant change in the near term. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Management has identified that the Company s most critical accounting estimates are those related to its ACL on loans and leases and business combinations accounting policies. These accounting policies and their underlying estimates are discussed directly with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases 
 The ACL on loans and leases is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense, which represents management s best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses within the Company s loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date. The calculation of expected credit losses is determined using predictive methods and models that follow a PD, LGD, EAD, or loss rate framework and include consideration of past events, current conditions, macroeconomic variables (i.e., unemployment, gross domestic product, property values, and interest rate spreads), and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Changes to the ACL on loans and leases, and therefore, to the related provision for credit losses, can materially affect financial results. 
 The determination of the appropriate level of ACL on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing qualitative and quantitative information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, all of which may undergo frequent and material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and macroeconomic variables that the Company is more susceptible to, unforeseen events such as natural disasters and pandemics, along with new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors, both within and outside the Company s control, may indicate the need for an increase or decrease in the ACL on loans and leases. 
 It is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall reserve because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the ACL and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Further, changes in factors and inputs may also be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. 
 Executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the ACL on loans and leases on a quarterly basis. Although the overall balance is determined based on specific portfolio segments and individually assessed assets, the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses for any of the loan and lease portfolios. 
 Additional information regarding the determination of the ACL on loans and leases, including the Company s valuation methodology, can be found under the section captioned Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases contained elsewhere in this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and within Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Business Combinations 
 The acquisition method of accounting generally requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The determination of fair value often involves the use of internal or third-party valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow analyses or appraisals. Particularly, the valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of the core deposit intangible asset acquired in the Ametros acquisition includes estimates related to discount rates, client attrition rates, an alternative cost of funds, and other relevant factors, which are inherently subjective. A description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Ametros acquisition can be found within Note 2: Business Developments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements.

 million, the forgiveness of million in long-term debt, and the assumption of a million liability for the Seller s transaction expenses, has been preliminarily allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their acquisition-date fair values, as summarized in the following table: (In thousands) Fair Value Purchase price consideration Assets: Cash and due from banks Premises and equipment

 ) Other liabilities: Accounts payable Accrued expenses Deferred revenue Members funds Operating lease liabilities Total other liabilities Total liabilities assumed Net assets acquired Pre-existing equity interest (2) 
 Goodwill 
 (1) The million reflects the amount held in Ametros operating cash account at the Bank on January 24, 2024. Upon acquisition, such cash and the Bank s corresponding deposit liability owed to Ametros were eliminated in consolidation, which resulted in a decrease to interest-bearing deposits for the Bank and the Bank s legal title to the funds being held in such operating cash account. 
 (2) Prior to the acquisition date, the Company had a equity interest in Ametros. The consideration transferred reflects the purchase price for the remaining of the business. Upon acquisition, the Company recognized a million gain in Other income on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income, which represents the difference between the cost basis and estimated acquisition-date fair value of the Company s pre-existing equity interest in Ametros. 
 The million of preliminary goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Information regarding the allocation of goodwill to the Company s reportable segments can be found within Note 14: Segment Reporting. 
 The Company considers its valuations of other intangible assets, deferred taxes, and certain other assets and other liabilities to be provisional, as management continues to identify and assess information regarding the nature of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including extended information gathering and management review procedures. Although the Company believes that the information available as of September 30, 2024, provides a reasonable basis for estimating fair value, it is possible that additional information becomes available during the one-year measurement period following the close of the acquisition, which could result in changes to the fair values presented. 
 The results of operations related to the acquired Ametros business are included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income subsequent to the acquisition date, and were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 43 

million core deposit intangible asset and a million trade name intangible asset. A core deposit intangible asset represents the value of relationships with deposit customers. The fair value of the core deposit intangible asset was estimated using a net cost savings method, a form of discounted cash flow methodology, which gave appropriate consideration to expected client attrition rates and other applicable adjustments to the projected deposit balance, the interest cost and net maintenance cost associated with the client deposit base, an alternative cost of funds, and a discount rate that was used to discount the future economic benefits of the core deposit intangible asset to present value. The core deposit intangible asset is being amortized on an accelerated basis over an estimated useful life of years, which is the period over which the estimated economic benefits are estimated to be received. The fair value of the trade name intangible asset for the Ametros brand was estimated using a relief-from-royalty methodology, which models the cost savings from owning the brand rather than licensing it from a third party. The trade name intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of years. 
 Funds held in escrow and Members funds. Funds held in escrow represent amounts held in interest-bearing checking accounts at insured depository institutions other than the Bank for the purpose of providing post-settlement medical administration services on a respective member s behalf. Members funds is the corresponding liability to the Funds held in escrow. Given that these amounts can be withdrawn and/or directed for use on demand, as long as in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement, their carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
 Multi-family Securitization 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company completed a multi-family securitization, in which it transferred million of multi-family loans million carrying amount plus million accrued interest receivable) to a third-party depositor, who placed the multi-family loans into a third-party trust, in exchange for net cash proceeds of million. Through a two-step process, pass-through certificates were issued, which are secured by the multi-family loans and guaranteed by Freddie Mac. The transfer of the multi-family loans was accounted for as a sale in accordance with ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. Servicing rights were not retained. 
 Per the terms of the securitization agreement, the Company assumed an obligation to reimburse Freddie Mac for any payments made under Freddie Mac s guarantee of the certificates. The reimbursement obligation covers losses up to 12 of the aggregate UPB of the multi-family loans at the time of sale, and is secured in full by an irrevocable letter of credit issued by the FHLB. Essentially, this reimbursement obligation represents a first credit loss enhancement provided by the Company to Freddie Mac. Based on the credit quality of the multi-family loans at the time of sale, among other factors, the Company estimated the fair value of its reimbursement obligation to be million. The fair value of the reimbursement obligation is included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Including the reimbursement obligation, the transaction resulted in a net gain on sale of million, which is included in Other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Until the Company s obligation to reimburse Freddie Mac for the first 12 of losses is reduced to 25 of the initial amount, it may have the option to exercise certain contingent repurchase rights over the transferred multi-family loans, unless it elects to waive or assign those rights. At the time of sale, the Company does not intend to repurchase any of the multi-family loans. 
 Held-for-Sale Payroll Finance Portfolio and Sale of Factored Receivables Portfolio 
 In March 2024, the Company initiated a plan to actively sell its payroll finance and factored receivables loan portfolios, along with the related customer contracts. This decision was a direct result of the Company s continuous reassessment of its strategic model in an effort to identify opportunities to improve its core financial products and services. 
 On September 27, 2024, the Company sold its factored receivables loan portfolio of million, and the related customer contracts, for proceeds of million. After the write-off of the factored receivables customer relationship intangible asset, which had a net carrying amount of million, less million of selling costs, the sale of assets resulted in a million net loss on sale. The net loss is included in Other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and in the Corporate and Reconciling category for segment reporting purposes in accordance with the Company s methodology. 
 As of the third quarter of 2024, the Company still intends to sell its payroll finance loan portfolio, which had a carrying amount of million at September 30, 2024. Accordingly, the portfolio remains classified as held for sale, and therefore, is included in Loans held for sale on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Joint Venture with Marathon Asset Management 
 On July 19, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Marathon Asset Management to form a private credit joint venture which will deliver direct lending solutions for sponsor-backed middle market companies across the country.

individual mortgage loans with an aggregate UPB of billion. In connection with the sale, the Company received net cash proceeds of million and derecognized million of mortgage servicing rights from Accrued interest receivable and other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The resulting million net gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights is included in Other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 interLINK Acquisition 
 On January 11, 2023, the Company acquired ownership of interLINK from StoneCastle Partners LLC. interLINK is a technology-enabled deposit management platform that administers over 9 billion of deposits from FDIC-insured cash sweep programs between banks and broker/dealers and clearing firms. The acquisition provided the Company with access to a unique source of core deposit funding and scalable liquidity and added another technology-enabled channel to its already differentiated, omnichannel deposit gathering capabilities. 
 The total purchase price of the acquisition was million, which included cash paid of million and million of contingent consideration measured at fair value. The contingent consideration is payable in cash upon the achievement of discrete customer and deposit growth events within three years of the acquisition date. Additional information regarding contingent consideration, including the determination of fair value, can be found within Note 13: Fair Value Measurements. 
 The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination, and resulted in the addition of million in net assets measured at fair value, which primarily comprised million of broker dealer relationship intangible assets, million of developed technology, a million non-competition agreement intangible asset, and million of royalty liabilities. The million of goodwill recognized is deductible for tax purposes.

 The million decrease in gross unrealized losses from December 31, 2023, to September 30, 2024, is primarily due to lower interest rates, as well as net realized losses from sales of available-for-sale securities. The Company assesses each available-for-sale security that is in an unrealized loss position to determine whether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is a result of a credit loss or other factors. At both September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, no ACL was recorded on available-for-sale securities as each of the securities in the Company s portfolio are investment grade, current as to principal and interest, and their price changes are consistent with interest and credit spreads when adjusting for convexity, rating, and industry differences. 
 As of September 30, 2024, based on current market conditions and the Company s targeted balance sheet composition strategy, the Company intends to hold its available-for-sale securities with unrealized loss positions through the anticipated recovery period. The issuers of these available-for-sale securities have not, to the Company s knowledge, established any cause for default. Market prices are expected to approach par as the securities approach maturity.

 Collateral Dependent Loans and Leases 
 A non-accrual loan or lease is considered collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and when repayment is substantially expected to be provided through the operation or sale of collateral. Commercial non-mortgage loans, asset-based loans, and equipment financing loans and leases are generally secured by machinery and equipment, inventory, receivables, or other non-real estate assets, whereas commercial real estate, multi-family, residential, home equity, and other consumer loans are secured by real estate. 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of collateral dependent loans was million and million, respectively, for commercial loans and leases, and million and million, respectively, for consumer loans. The ACL for collateral dependent loans and leases is individually assessed based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell at the reporting date.

 At September 30, 2024, the Company had million of cash collateral received and 15.7 million of cash collateral posted included in Cash and due from banks on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company had million in initial margin posted at clearing houses. The Company regularly evaluates the credit risk of its derivative customers, taking into account the likelihood of default, net exposures, and remaining contractual life, among other related factors. Credit risk exposure is mitigated as transactions with customers are generally secured by the same collateral of the underlying transactions. The current net credit exposure relating to derivative contracts with customers was million at September 30, 2024. In addition, the Company also monitors potential future exposure, representing its best estimate of exposure to remaining contractual maturity. The potential future exposure relating to derivative contracts with customers was million at September 30, 2024. The Company has incorporated a credit valuation adjustment (contra-liability) to reflect non-performance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives, which totaled million and million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Various factors impact changes in the valuation adjustment over time, such as changes in the credit spreads of the contracted parties, and changes in market rates and volatilities, which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments.

 Alternative Investments. Equity investments have a readily determinable fair value when unadjusted quoted prices are available in an active market for identical assets. Accordingly, these alternative investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2023, equity investments with a readily determinable fair value had a total carrying amount of million, with remaining unfunded commitment. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company sold its equity investments with a readily determinable fair value for proceeds of million. Prior to the sale, these alternative investments experienced total write-ups in fair value of million. 
 Equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value may qualify for the NAV practical expedient if they meet certain requirements. The Company s alternative investments measured at NAV consist of investments in non-public entities that cannot be redeemed since investments are distributed as the fund is liquidated. Alternative investments measured at NAV are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, these alternative investments had a total carrying amount of million and million, respectively, and a remaining unfunded commitment of million and million, respectively. 
 Contingent Consideration. The Company recorded contingent consideration at fair value related to two earn-out agreements associated with the acquisition of interLINK in January 2023. The terms of the purchase agreement specified that the seller would receive earn-outs based on the ability of the Company to: (i) re-sign the existing broker dealers under contract, and (ii) generate billion in new broker dealer deposit programs within three years of the acquisition date. The estimated fair values of the contingent consideration liabilities are measured on a recurring basis and determined using an income approach considering management s evaluation of the probability of achievement, forecasted achievement date (payment term), and a discount rate equivalent to the cost of debt. These significant inputs, which are the responsibility of management and calculated with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist, are not observable, and accordingly, are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 (ii) Deposit program growth 
 At December 31, 2023 Agreement Maximum Amount Probability of Achievement Payment Term (in years) Discount Rate Fair Value (i) Re-sign broker dealers (ii) Deposit program growth 
 (1) The Company re-signed one of the existing broker dealers under contract in January 2024, which resulted in the cash payment of million during the first quarter of 2024 to settle a portion of its contingent consideration obligation with StoneCastle Partners LLC in accordance with the purchase agreement. 
 Contingent consideration liabilities are included within Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities are included in Other expense on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

million and million, respectively, of which million and million, respectively, were considered to be measured at fair value. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were million and million, respectively, in total write-ups due to observable price changes, and and million of total write-downs due to impairment, respectively. 
 Loans Transferred to Held for Sale. Once a decision has been made to sell loans not previously classified as held for sale, these loans are transferred into the held for sale category and carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. At the time of transfer and classification as held for sale, any amount by which cost exceeds fair value is accounted for as a valuation allowance. This activity generally pertains to loans with observable inputs, and therefore, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, should these loans include adjustments for changes in loan characteristics based on unobservable inputs, the loans would then be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were million and million loans that were transferred to held for sale on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively. 
 Collateral Dependent Loans and Leases. Loans and leases for which repayment is substantially expected to be provided through the operation or sale of collateral are considered collateral dependent, and are valued based on the estimated fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell at the reporting date, using customized discounting criteria. Accordingly, collateral dependent loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets. OREO and repossessed assets are held at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be measured at fair value when recorded below cost. The fair value of OREO is calculated using independent appraisals or internal valuation methods, less estimated selling costs, and may consider available pricing guides, auction results, and price opinions. Certain repossessed assets may also require assumptions about factors that are not observable in an active market when determining fair value. Accordingly, OREO and repossessed assets are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the total carrying value of OREO and repossessed assets was million and million, respectively. In addition, the amortized cost of consumer loans secured by residential real estate property that were in process of foreclosure at September 30, 2024, was million. 
 Estimated Fair Values of Financial Instruments and Mortgage Servicing Assets 
 The Company is required to disclose the estimated fair values of certain financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate fair value for those assets and liabilities. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents . Given the short time frame to maturity, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, which comprises cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits, approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Held-to-Maturity Securities . When quoted market prices are not available, the Company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value. These fair value measurements consider observable data, such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. Management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing service s results and has a process in place to challenge their valuations and methodologies. Held-to-maturity securities, which include Agency CMO, Agency MBS, Agency CMBS, Municipal bonds and notes, and CMBS, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Loans and Leases, net . Except for collateral dependent loans and leases, the fair value of loans and leases held for investment is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology, based on future prepayments and market interest rates inclusive of an illiquidity discount for comparable loans and leases. The associated cash flows are then adjusted for associated credit risks and other potential losses, as appropriate. Loans and leases are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Note 14: 
 reportable segments, which reflect its primary differentiated lines of business: Commercial Banking, Healthcare Financial Services, and Consumer Banking. Segment performance is evaluated using PPNR, or PTNR, as appropriate. Certain Treasury activities and other functional divisions, such as information technology, human resources, risk management, bank operations, and the operations of interLINK, as well as amounts required to reconcile non-GAAP profitability metrics to those reported in accordance with GAAP, are included in the Corporate and Reconciling category. 
 Effective January 1, 2024, the Company realigned certain of its Business Banking operations to better serve its customers and deliver operational efficiencies. Under this realignment, billion of loans and billion of deposits were reassigned, and million of goodwill was reallocated on a relative fair value basis, from Commercial Banking to Consumer Banking. There was no goodwill impairment as a result of this realignment. Prior period amounts have been recast accordingly. 
 In addition, with the acquisition of Ametros on January 24, 2024, the Company formed a new reportable segment called Healthcare Financial Services, which includes the aggregated financial information of the HSA Bank and Ametros businesses. The allocation of the purchase price for the Ametros acquisition is considered preliminary at September 30, 2024. The million of preliminary goodwill recorded related to Ametros has been allocated entirely to Healthcare Financial Services. 
 The allocation of the purchase price for the interLINK acquisition on January 11, 2023, was considered final as of June 30, 2023. The million of goodwill recorded related to interLINK was allocated entirely to Commercial Banking. 
 The following is a description of the Company s three reportable segments and their primary services at September 30, 2024: 
 Commercial Banking serves businesses with more than 10 million of revenue through its Commercial Real Estate, Equipment Finance, Middle Market, Regional Banking, Asset-Based Lending, Commercial Services, Public Sector Finance, Sponsor and Specialty Finance, Verticals and Support, Private Banking, and Treasury Management business units. 
 Healthcare Financial Services offers consumer-directed healthcare solutions that includes HSAs, health reimbursement arrangements, the administration of medical insurance claim settlements, flexible spending accounts, and commuter benefits. Accounts are distributed nationwide directly to employers and individual consumers, as well as through national and regional insurance carriers, benefit consultants, and financial advisors. 
 Consumer Banking offers consumer deposit and fee-based services, residential mortgages, home equity lines, secured and unsecured loans, debit and credit card products, and investment services to individual consumers and small businesses through its Consumer Lending and Business Banking business units. Consumer Banking operates a distribution network consisting of 196 banking centers and 347 ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services, primarily throughout southern New England and the New York metro and suburban markets. 
 Segment Reporting Methodology 
 The Company uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by reportable segment, which is based on a series of management estimates for FTP and allocations for non-interest expense, provision for credit losses, income taxes, and equity capital. These estimates and allocations, certain of which are subjective in nature, are periodically reviewed and refined. For additional information regarding the Company s segment reporting methodology, please refer to Note 21: Segment Reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

million and million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. Both of these balances were recorded in connection with contracts with customers from the acquired Ametros business. Ametros contracts with customers include a fixed, non-refundable fee that represents an advance payment for access to future discounted medical products and services. This up-front fee is initially deferred and subsequently recognized into Other income ratably over the estimated life expectancy of the member. An insignificant amount of such fee revenue was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Contracts with customers did not generate significant contract assets or contract liabilities at December 31, 2023.

Note 16: 
 Standby letters of credit Commercial letters of credit Total credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk 
 The Company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to its customers (i.e., revolving credit arrangements, term loan commitments, and short-term borrowing agreements), generally with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and that require payment of a fee. Substantially all of the Company s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon its customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding, and are often secured by real estate collateral. Since the majority of the Company s commitments typically expire without being funded, the total contractual amount does not necessarily represent the Company s future payment requirements. 
 Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee its customers performance to a third party. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of its agreement with a third-party, the Company would be required to fund the commitment. The contractual amount of each standby letter of credit represents the maximum amount of potential future payments the Company could be required to make. Historically, the majority of the Company s standby letters of credit expire without being funded. However, if the commitment were funded, the Company has recourse against the customer. The Company s standby letter of credit agreements are often secured by cash or other collateral. 
 Commercial letters of credit are issued to finance either domestic or foreign customer trade arrangements. As a general rule, drafts are committed to be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in transit. Similar to standby letters of credit, the Company s commercial letter of credit agreements are often secured by the underlying goods subject to trade. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments 
 An ACL is recorded under the CECL methodology and included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to provide for the unused portion of commitments to lend that are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the ACL on unfunded loan commitments totaled million and million, respectively. Litigation 
 The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and unasserted claims and assessments in the ordinary course of business. Legal contingencies are evaluated based on information currently available, including advice of counsel and assessment of available insurance coverage. The Company establishes an accrual for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Once established, each accrual is adjusted to reflect any subsequent developments. Legal contingencies are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings may occur that could cause the Company to either adjust its litigation accrual or incur actual losses that exceed the current estimate, which ultimately could have a material adverse effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on its business, financial condition, or operating results. The Company will consider settlement of cases when it is in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The Company intends to defend itself in all claims asserted against it, and management currently believes that the outcome of these contingencies will not be material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the Company or its consolidated financial position. 
 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment 
 On November 29, 2023, the FDIC published a final rule implementing a special assessment for certain banks to recover losses incurred by protecting uninsured depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank upon their failure in March 2023. The special assessment is to be collected for an anticipated total of ten quarterly assessment periods, which began during the second quarter of 2024. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company s accrual for its estimated special assessment charge was million and million, respectively. The FDIC retains the right to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period, and impose shortfall special assessments if actual losses exceed the amounts collected. The Company continues to monitor the estimated loss attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which could impact the amount of its accrued liability.

 he Company has evaluated subsequent events from the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and accompanying Notes thereto, through the date of issuance, and determined that no significant events were identified requiring recognition or disclosure. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Information regarding quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk can be found in Part I within Note 12: Derivative Financial Instruments in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements, and under the section captioned Asset/Liability Management and Market Risk contained in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (who is our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Because of its inherent limitations, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
