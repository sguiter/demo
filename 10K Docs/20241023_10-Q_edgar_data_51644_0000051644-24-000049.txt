 Uncommitted Lines of Credit 
 We also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates and that are primarily used to fund working capital needs. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations.

 . We concluded that the fair value of the remaining reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and the remaining reporting unit was not impaired. 
 The fair value of both the reporting unit pre-classification and the fair values of the disposal groups and the remaining reporting unit that is in our ongoing operations for which we performed the quantitative interim impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We generally apply an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our quantitative impairment test analysis, although higher weighting was given to the market approach for determining the fair value of disposal groups. For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to the reporting unit and disposal groups include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples. Additionally, our determination of the market approach for the disposal groups also considered ranges of initial offers received as part of the sale process. 
 The discount rate used for the reporting unit and disposal groups is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. For the interim impairment tests of goodwill, the discount rates used ranged from to , and the terminal value growth rates were and . The terminal value growth rates represent the expected long-term growth rates. The revenue growth rates utilized in the interim impairment tests were between and . Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit and disposal groups provide for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit and disposal groups conduct business and the maturity of the reporting units and disposal groups. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and could result in an impairment charge in the future.

The amounts payable within the next twelve months are classified in accrued liabilities; any amounts payable thereafter are classified in other non-current liabilities. 
 Financial Instruments that are not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 
 Our long-term debt is comprised of senior notes and other notes payable. The fair value of our senior notes, which are traded over-the-counter, is based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Therefore, these senior notes are classified as Level 2. Our other notes payable are not actively traded, and their fair value is not solely derived from readily observable inputs. The fair value of our other notes payable is determined based on a discounted cash flow model and other proprietary valuation methods, and therefore is classified as Level 3. See Note 3 for further information on our long-term debt.

 Legal Matters 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings, and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the normal course of business. The types of allegations that arise in connection with such legal proceedings vary in nature, but can include claims related to contract, employment, tax and intellectual property matters. We evaluate all cases each reporting period and record liabilities for losses from legal proceedings when we determine that it is probable that the outcome in a legal proceeding will be unfavorable and the amount, or potential range, of loss can be reasonably estimated. In certain cases, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages. While any outcome related to litigation or such governmental proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to help you understand The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company, IPG, we, us or our ). MD A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ), as well as our other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Our 2023 Annual Report includes additional information about our significant accounting policies and practices as well as details about the most significant risks and uncertainties associated with our financial and operating results. Our MD A includes the following sections: 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY provides a discussion about our strategic outlook, factors influencing our business and an overview of our results of operations.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES provides an update to the discussion in our 2023 Annual Report of our accounting policies that require critical judgment, assumptions and estimates. 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, by reference to Note 13 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, provides a discussion of certain accounting standards that have been recently adopted or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations. 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP financial measures and sets forth the reasons we believe that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure contained therein provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition.

Our financial goals include competitive organic growth of revenue before billable expenses and expansion of Adjusted EBITA margin, as defined and discussed within the Non-GAAP Financial Measure section of this MD A, which we expect will further strengthen our balance sheet and total liquidity and increase value to our stakeholders. Accordingly, we remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients while concurrently managing our cost structure. We continually seek greater efficiency in the delivery of our services, focusing on more effective resource utilization, including the productivity of our employees, real estate, information technology and shared services, such as finance, human resources and legal. The improvements we have made and continue to make in our financial reporting and business information systems in recent years allow us more timely and actionable insights from our global operations. Our disciplined approach to our balance sheet and liquidity provides us with a solid financial foundation and financial flexibility to manage and grow our business. We believe that our strategy and execution position us to meet our financial goals and to deliver long-term value to all of our stakeholders. 
 Current Market Conditions 
 The global macroeconomic backdrop continues to be characterized by complex business, economic and geopolitical crosscurrents. D espite the potential for volatility, however, the macroeconomic business environment is broadly supportive, with the easing of US monetary policy and the consensus conviction that the U.S. has avoided a long-anticipated recession. Nonetheless, shifting political and economic developments domestically and the persistence of regional conflicts around the world has served to introduce a measure of macro caution. It is notable that media markets continue their robust and varied growth, most notably in digital addressable channels. Along with proliferating media complexity, consumers continue to evolve at pace in the ways they interact with brands. These latter trends in concert with a solid economy offer notable support to investment by large marketers in the advanced capabilities in which we specialize. 
 The principal macroeconomic risks to our performance include the impact of any general or regional economic slowdown or contraction, the extent of inflation of labor costs and potential for labor shortages, continuing inflationary pressures on our clients and their customers, and the economic impacts of geopolitical conflict and resulting potential for uncertainty and restrictions on spending on the part of some clients and consumers. See Item 1A, Risk Factors , in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Our Financial Information 
 When we analyze period-to-period changes in our operating performance, we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and the remainder we call organic change, which indicates how our underlying business performed. We exclude the impact of billable expenses in analyzing our operating performance as the fluctuations from period to period are not indicative of the performance of our underlying businesses and have no impact on our operating income or net income. 
 The change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the prior-period reported results using the current-period exchange rates and comparing these prior-period adjusted amounts to the prior-period reported results. Although the U.S. Dollar is our reporting currency, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies. Therefore, our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses. Our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency. Both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar affect our consolidated results of operations, and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact to our operations related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region. The foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the first nine months of 2024 were the Argentine Peso, the Japanese Yen and the Chilean Peso. The foreign currencies that most favorably impacted our results during the first nine months of 2024 were the British Pound Sterling, the Colombian Peso and the Euro. 
 For purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred. We continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses, and over the past several years, we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan. 
 The metrics that we use to evaluate our financial performance include organic change in revenue before billable expenses as well as the change in certain operating expenses, and the components thereof, expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenue before billable expenses, as well as Adjusted EBITA. These metrics are also used by management to assess the financial performance of our reportable segments, MD E, IA C, and SC E. In certain of our discussions, we analyze revenue before billable expenses by geographic region and by business sector, in which we focus on our top 500 clients, which typically constitute approximately 85 of our annual consolidated revenue before billable expenses.

Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The Consolidated Financial Statements and MD A presented herein reflect the latest estimates and assumptions made by us that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to assess the fair values of the Company s goodwill, long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets; assessment of the annual effective tax rate; valuation of deferred income taxes and the allowance for expected credit losses on future uncollectible accounts receivable. If actual market conditions vary significantly from those currently projected, these estimates and assumptions could materially change resulting in adjustments to the carrying values of our assets and liabilities.

Our org ani c revenue before billable expenses wa s flat d uring the third quarter of 2024, compared to an organic decrease of (0.4) during the third quarter of 2023. This was a result of net client wins and increased spending from existing clients in our food beverage and consumer goods sectors being offset by net client losses and lower spending from existing clients in our auto transportation and technology telecom sectors. During the third quarter of 2024, our Adjusted EBITA margin on revenue before billable expense s was unchanged at 17.2 from the prior-year period as revenue before billable expenses and operating expenses, excluding billable expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill, dec reased. Se e further discussion below in the Results of Operations section.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Consolidated Results of Operations Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue before billable expenses 
 Our revenue before billable expenses is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients. Most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue. Our revenue before billable expenses is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter, reflecting the seasonal spending of our clients. 
 Components of Change Change Three months ended September 30, 2023 Foreign Currency Net Acquisitions/ (Divestitures) Organic Three months ended September 30, 2024 Organic Total Consolidated 2,309.0 (10.4) (56.1) 0.2 2,242.7 0.0 (2.9) Domestic 1,509.9 (42.3) 0.2 1,467.8 0.0 (2.8) International 799.1 (10.4) (13.8) 0.0 774.9 0.0 (3.0) United Kingdom 193.0 4.1 (2.0) (1.3) 193.8 (0.7) 0.4 Continental Europe 178.3 0.5 (2.3) 1.0 177.5 0.6 (0.4) Asia Pacific 175.3 (0.2) (5.3) (12.9) 156.9 (7.4) (10.5) Latin America 114.8 (12.8) (1.3) 11.2 111.9 9.8 (2.5) Other 137.7 (2.0) (2.9) 2.0 134.8 1.5 (2.1) 
 The organic change of revenue before billable expenses was 0.0 during the third quarter of 2024. The organic change in our domestic market was primarily due to revenue increases at our media businesses, sports marketing business, public relations agencies and data management and analytics, offset by revenue decreases at our advertising businesses and digital project-based offerings. In our international markets, the organic change was driven by revenue increases at our advertising businesses primarily in our Continental Europe and Latin America regions and revenue increases at our media businesses in our Latin America and United Kingdom regions, offset by revenue decreases at our media businesses primarily in our Asia Pacific and Continental Europe regions. 
 Components of Change Change Nine months ended September 30, 2023 Foreign Currency Net Acquisitions/ (Divestitures) Organic Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Organic Total Consolidated 6,814.4 (21.5) (108.4) 68.2 6,752.7 1.0 (0.9) Domestic 4,512.3 (94.1) 51.4 4,469.6 1.1 (0.9) International 2,302.1 (21.5) (14.3) 16.8 2,283.1 0.7 (0.8) United Kingdom 548.1 14.0 (2.0) 5.4 565.5 1.0 3.2 Continental Europe 534.5 (0.8) (5.3) 27.8 556.2 5.2 4.1 Asia Pacific 511.8 (12.0) (2.8) (30.0) 467.0 (5.9) (8.8) Latin America 301.9 (17.3) (1.3) 17.9 301.2 5.9 (0.2) Other 405.8 (5.4) (2.9) (4.3) 393.2 (1.1) (3.1) 
 The organic increase of revenue before billable expenses was 1.0 during the first nine months of 2024. The organic increase in our domestic market was primarily due to revenue increases at our media businesses, public relations agencies and advertising businesses, partially offset by revenue decreases at our digital project-based offerings. In our international markets, the 0.7 organic increase was driven by revenue increases at our advertising businesses in our Continental Europe and United Kingdom regions and at our media businesses in our Latin America region, partially offset by revenue decreases at our digital project-based offerings across nearly all regions and revenue decreases across most disciplines in our Asia Pacific region.

 Total salaries and related expenses decreased (4.4) during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by decreased base salaries, benefits and tax, performance-based employee compensation expense and temporary help expense. 
 Total salaries and related expenses decreased (2.4) during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by factors similar to those noted above for the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by increased severance expense.

 Office and other direct expenses increased by 2.6 during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase in office and other direct expenses was mainly due to increases in expenses related to technology software, as well as increases in expenses related to company meetings and conferences and bad debt expense. 
 Office and other direct expenses increased by 1.8 during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase in office and other direct expenses was primarily due to increases in expenses related to technology software, bad debt expense, and expenses related to new business development, partially offset by decreases in occupancy expense. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A are primarily the unallocated expenses of our "Corporate and Other" group, as detailed further in the segment discussion later in this MD A, excluding depreciation and amortizatio n. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A increased as compared to the prior-year period, primarily du e to increases in base salaries, benefits and tax technology software expenses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 CASH FLOW OVERVIEW 
 The following table summarizes key financial data relating to our liquidity, capital resources and uses of capital. 
 Nine months ended September 30, Cash Flow Data 2024 2023 Net income 
 357.4 646.5 Adjustments to reconcile to net cash used in operating activities 1 
 505.7 272.9 Net cash used in working capital 2 
 (619.1) (1,099.1) Changes in other non-current assets and liabilities (56.9) (160.4) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 187.1 (340.1) Net cash used in investing activities (131.8) (204.3) Net cash used in financing activities (897.6) (390.0) 
 
 1 Consist primarily of goodwill impairment, depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets, amortization of restricted stock and other non-cash compensation, deferred income taxes. 
 2 Reflects changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and contract liabilities. 
 Operating Activities 
 The presentation of the three components of net cash provided by operating activities above reflects the manner in which management views and analyzes this information. Management believes this presentation is useful as it presents cash provided by operating activities separately from the impact of changes in working capital, which is seasonal in nature and is impacted by the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients. Additionally, we view changes in other non-current assets and liabilities separately, as these items are not impacted by the factors described below. 
 Due to the seasonality of our business, we typically use cash from working capital in the first nine months of a year, with the largest impact in the first quarter, and generate cash from working capital in the fourth quarter, driven by the seasonally strong media spending by our clients. Quarterly and annual working capital results are impacted by the fluctuating annual media spending budgets of our clients as well as their changing media spending patterns throughout each year across various countries. 
 The timing of media buying on behalf of our clients across various countries affects our working capital and operating cash flow and can be volatile. In most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. To the extent possible, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients. The amounts involved, which substantially exceed our revenues, primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and contract liabilities. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass-through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers. Our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments. For example, while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the first nine months of 2024 was 187.1 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 340.1 in the first nine months of 2023, primarily attributable to a decrease in working capital usage of 480.0. Working capital use was primarily impacted by the spending levels of our clients and variation in the timing of collections and payments around the reporting period. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 was 131.8, which was a decrease of 72.5 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by a decrease of 97.0 in the purchase of short-term marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease from the net proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold of 32.8. Payments for capital expenditures decreased to 107.2 in the first nine months of 2024 from 127.1 in the first nine months of 2023, primarily attributable to lower spending on computer hardware and internal-use computer software, as well as lower spending on leasehold improvements. 
 Financing Activities

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - (continued) 
 (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 
 (Unaudited) 

Net cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 was 897.6, primarily driven by the payment of common stock dividends of 373.7, repayment of long-term debt of 250.1 and common stock repurchases of 230.1. 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2023 was 390.0, primarily driven by the payment of common stock dividends of 361.2 and common stock repurchases of 219.0, partially offset by net proceeds of 296.3 from the issuance our of 300.0 aggregate principal amount of 5.375 unsecured senior notes due 2033 (the "5.375 Senior Notes"). 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Changes 
 The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in a net decrease of 11.1 during the first nine months of 2024. The decrease was primarily a result of the U.S. Dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies, including the British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Brazilian Real as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. 
 LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK 
 We expect our cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. We also have a commercial paper program, a committed corporate credit facility, and uncommitted lines of credit to support our operating needs. Borrowings under our commercial paper program are supported by our committed corporate credit agreement. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity, with flexibility over significant uses of cash, including our capital expenditures, cash used for new acquisitions, our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends. 
 From time to time, we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile, enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk. Our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors, which include those specific to us, such as our credit ratings, and those related to the financial markets, such as the amount or terms of available credit. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity, or continue to access existing sources of liquidity, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Our most significant funding requirements include our operations, non-cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, common stock dividends, taxes, and debt service. Additionally, we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests. 
 Notable funding requirements include: 
 Debt service Our 4.200 unsecured senior notes in aggregate principal amount of 250.0 matured on April 15, 2024. We used cash on hand to fund the principal repayment. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding short-term borrowings of 23.9 from our uncommitted lines of credit used primarily to fund short-term working capital needs. The remainder of our debt is primarily long-term, with maturities scheduled from 2028 through 2048. 
 Acquisitions We paid deferred payments of 8.9 for prior-year acquisitions as well as ownership increases in our consolidated subsidiaries in the first nine months of 2024. In addition to potential cash expenditures for new acquisitions, we expect to pay approximately 5.0 over the next twelve months related to all completed acquisitions as of September 30, 2024. We may also be required to pay approximately 10.0 related to redeemable non-controlling interest held by minority shareholders, if exercised, over the next twelve months. We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to grow and continue to strengthen our market position, particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings, and to expand our presence in high-growth and key strategic world markets. 
 Dividends In the first nine months of 2024, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.330 per share on our common stock, which corresponded to an aggregate dividend payment of 373.7. Assuming we pay a quarterly dividend of 0.330 per share, and there is no significant change in the number of outstanding shares as of September 30, 2024, we would expect to pay approximately 491.0 over the next twelve months. Whether to declare and the amount of any such future dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors (the "Board") and will depend upon factors such as our earnings, financial position and cash requirements. 
 U.K. Pension Plan In December 2023, the Interpublic Limited Pension Plan in the U.K., (the "U.K. Pension Plan") the Company's U.K. defined benefit pension plan, entered into an agreement with an insurance company to purchase a group annuity, or "buy-in", that matches the plans future projected benefit obligations to covered participants. As part of the annuity purchase contract, the U.K. Pension Plan has the option to complete a "buy-out", which would transfer

all liabilities of the plan to the insurer, which the Company anticipates to be completed in the second half of 2025. The non-cash settlement charge, net of tax, associated with the transaction is currently estimated to be approximately 180.0 to 200.0 and is subject to finalization of terms and changes in the British Pound Sterling. 
 Share Repurchase Programs 
 On February 8, 2023, our Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 350.0, excluding fees, of our common stock. 
 On February 7, 2024, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 320.0, excluding fees, of our common stock, which was in addition to any amounts remaining under the 2023 share repurchase program. 
 We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules, derivative transactions or other means. We fully utilized the 2023 share repurchase program during the second quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 170.1, excluding fees, remains available under the 2024 share repurchase program. There is no expiration date associated with the 2024 share repurchase program. 
 FINANCING AND SOURCES OF FUNDS 
 Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies. Our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world, including at the holding company level. Below is a summary of our sources of liquidity. 
 Credit Agreement 
 We maintain a committed corporate credit facility, originally dated as of July 18, 2008, which has been amended and restated from time to time (the Credit Agreement ). We use our Credit Agreement to increase our financial flexibility, to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program. On May 29, 2024, we amended and restated the Credit Agreement. As amended, among other things, the maturity date of the Credit Agreement was extended to May 29, 2029, and the cost structure of the Credit Agreement was changed. The Credit Agreement continues to include a required leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00, among other customary covenants, including limitations on our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt. At the election of the Company, the leverage ratio may be changed to not more than 4.00 to 1.00 for four consecutive quarters, beginning with the fiscal quarter in which there is an occurrence of one or more acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of at least 200.0. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of 1,500.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. The Company has the ability to increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to 250.0, provided the Company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit of 50.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement; however, we had 9.3 of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, which reduced our total availability to 1,490.7. 
 We were in compliance with all of our covenants in the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. Management utilizes Credit Agreement EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as well as the amounts shown in the table below, calculated as required by the Credit Agreement, in order to assess our compliance with such covenants.

 2 Includes adjustments of the following items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations: provision for income taxes, total (expenses) and other income, equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates, and net income attributable to non-controlling interests. 
 Uncommitted Lines of Credit 
 We also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates and that are primarily used to fund working capital needs. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of 794.4, under which we had outstanding borrowings of 23.9 classified as short-term borrowings on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The average amount outstanding during the third quarter of 2024 was 46.9 with weighted-average interest rate of approximately 7.1 . 
 Commercial Paper 
 The Company is authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 1,500.0. Borrowings under the program are supported by the Credit Agreement described above. Proceeds of the commercial paper are used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other short-term liquidity needs. The maturities of the commercial paper vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. During the third quarter of 2024, there was no commercial paper activity, and as of September 30, 2024, there was no commercial paper outstanding. 
 Cash Pooling 
 We aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the United States, we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several IPG agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of set-off against amounts other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of September 30, 2024, the amount netted was 2,522.1. 
 DEBT CREDIT RATINGS 
 Our debt credit ratings as of October 18, 2024 , are listed below. 
 Moody s Investors Service S P Global Ratings Fitch Ratings Short-term rating P-2 A-2 F1 Long-term rating Baa2 BBB BBB+ Outlook Stable Positive Stable 
 A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency. The rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity, either adverse or favorable, because, among other things, they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise. For example, our Credit Agreement fees and borrowing rates are

based on a credit ratings grid, and our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient short-term debt ratings. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our 2023 Annual Report. As summarized in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in our 2023 Annual Report, we believe that certain of these policies are critical because they are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These critical estimates relate to revenue recognition, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, and pension and postretirement benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Estimation methodologies are applied consistently from year to year, and there have been no significant changes in the application of critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and further decline in macroeconomic conditions or increasing interest rates could have a negative impact on these estimates, including the fair value of certain assets. 
 
 Goodwill 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we concluded that declines in the forecasted performance of one of our reporting units included within our MD E segment, combined with the classification of R/GA and Huge, which comprised a significant portion of the reporting unit, as held for sale was a triggering event which required a goodwill impairment assessment. As of August 31, 2024, we performed a pre-classification goodwill impairment test and determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and therefore, goodwill of the reporting unit was impaired. The Company completed an analysis to allocate goodwill to the remaining reporting unit, R/GA and Huge using a relative fair value approach. Additionally, we performed a post-classification goodwill impairment test on R/GA and Huge, as well as an impairment test of the businesses remaining within the reporting unit. We determined that the carrying value of one disposal group exceeded its fair value and goodwill was impaired. As a result of both the pre-classification and post-classification impairment tests, the Company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of . We concluded that the fair value of the remaining reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and the remaining reporting unit was not impaired. 
 The fair value of both the reporting unit pre-classification and the fair values of the disposal groups and the remaining reporting unit that is in our ongoing operations for which we performed the quantitative interim impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We generally apply an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our quantitative impairment test analysis, although higher weighting was given to the market approach for determining the fair value of disposal groups. For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to the reporting unit and disposal groups include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples. Additionally, our determination of the market approach for the disposal groups also considered ranges of initial offers received as part of the sale process. 
 The discount rate used for the reporting unit and disposal groups is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. For the interim impairment tests of goodwill, the discount rates used ranged from 14.5 to 22.0 , and the terminal value growth rates were 2.5 and 3.0 . The terminal value growth rates represent the expected long-term growth rates. The revenue growth rates utilized in the interim impairment tests were between (2.0 and 6.0 . Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit and disposal groups provide for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit and disposal groups conduct business and the maturity of the reporting units and disposal groups. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and could result in an impairment charge in the future.

We also performed a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test. Our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for the reporting unit and disposal unit, where the low end of the range increases discount rates by 0.5 , and the high end of the range decreases discount rates by 0.5 . We use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test. 
 The table below displays the midpoint of the fair value range for the remaining reporting unit tested in the interim impairment test, indicating that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for the reporting unit. 
 2024 Interim Impairment Test Reporting Unit Goodwill Fair value exceeds carrying value by: A 402.5 > 2 
 Based on the analysis described above, we determined the goodwill of the remaining reporting unit was not impaired as of September 30, 2024, because the fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value. 
 We also considered the potential for goodwill impairment of our other reporting units. Our review of our other reporting units did not indicate an impairment triggering event as of September 30, 2024.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE 
 This MD A includes both financial measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as well as a non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP financial measure represents Net Income Available to IPG Common Stockholders before Provision for Income Taxes, Total (Expenses) and Other Income, Equity in Net Loss of Unconsolidated Affiliates, Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests, Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Impairment of Goodwill, which we refer to as Adjusted EBITA . 
 Adjusted EBITA should be viewed as supplemental to, and not as an alternative for, Net Income Available to IPG Common Stockholders calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP net income or operating income calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP operating income ). This section also includes reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as presented below. 
 Adjusted EBITA is used by our management as an additional measure of our Company s performance for purposes of business decision-making, including developing budgets, managing expenditures and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITA help our management identify additional trends in our Company s financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income or operating income. In addition, we use Adjusted EBITA in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees in order to evaluate our Company s performance. Our management recognizes that Adjusted EBITA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items, particularly those items that are recurring in nature. Management also reviews operating income and net income as well as the specific items that are excluded from Adjusted EBITA, but included in net income or operating income, as well as trends in those items. The amounts of those items are set forth, for the applicable periods, in the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITA to net income that accompany our disclosure documents containing non-GAAP financial measures, including the reconciliations contained in this MD A. 
 We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITA is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons why our management finds it useful and because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions. In addition, as more fully described below, we believe that providing Adjusted EBITA, together with a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income, helps investors make comparisons between our Company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different effective income tax rates and tax attributes, different capitalized asset values and/or different forms of employee compensation. However, Adjusted EBITA is intended to provide a supplemental way of comparing our Company with other public companies and is not intended as a substitute for comparisons based on net income or operating income. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies may use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures provided by each company under the applicable rules of the SEC. 
 The following is an explanation of the items excluded by us from Adjusted EBITA but included in net income: 
 
 Total (Expenses) and Other Income, Provision for Income Taxes, Equity in Net Loss of Unconsolidated Affiliates, and Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests. We exclude these items (i) because these items are not directly attributable to the performance of our business operations and, accordingly, their exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance and (ii) to assist management and investors in making comparisons to companies with different capital structures. Investors should note that these items will recur in future periods. 
 Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Impairment of Goodwill . Amortization of acquired intangibles is a non-cash expense relating to intangible assets arising from acquisitions that are expensed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets. Impairment of goodwill is a non-cash expense recognized when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill because we believe that (i) the amounts of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions and full amortization, or changes in the carrying values or fair values of goodwill reporting units. Accordingly, we believe that this exclusion assists management and investors in making period-to-period comparisons of operating performance. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue generation and should also note that such expenses may recur in future periods.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. From time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. Derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. There has been no significant change in our exposure to market risk during the third quarter of 2024. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 99 of our debt obligations bore interest rates at fixed rates. For further discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk , in our 2023 Annual Report. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 1 The total number of shares of our common stock purchased includes shares withheld under the terms of grants under employee stock-based compensation plans to offset tax withholding obligations that arose upon vesting and release of restricted shares (the Withheld Shares ). We repurchased 1,021 Withheld Shares in July 2024; 2,055 Withheld Shares in August 2024; and 1,040 Withheld Shares in September 2024, for a total of 4,116 Withheld Shares during the three-month period. 
 
 2 The average price per share for each of the months in the fiscal quarter and for the three-month period was calculated by dividing (a) the sum for the applicable period of the aggregate value of the tax withholding obligations and the aggregate amount we paid for shares acquired under our share repurchase program, described in Note 5 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, by (b) the sum of the number of Withheld Shares and the number of shares acquired in our share repurchase program.
