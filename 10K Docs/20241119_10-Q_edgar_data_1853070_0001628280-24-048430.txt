 In September 2024, we announced an agreement with flyExclusive, Inc. flyExclusive ), a leading provider of private jet charter services, to transition our fleet operations to flyExclusive. This move is expected to bring substantial cost savings and provide Volato with the opportunity to focus on what it believes to be its high-growth areas, including aircraft sales and proprietary software. We will continue to take delivery of new aircraft, and these aircraft may become part of flyExclusive's managed fleet. Volato will benefit from the margins on aircraft sales without the burden of operational costs, while also generating revenue from our proprietary software, including the Vaunt program, Volato s successful empty leg consumer app.

 Legal Contingencies

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations (MD A) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this MD A section to we, us, our, and the Company are intended to mean the business and operations of Volato Group, Inc. 
 
 Overview of Our Business 
 Our revenue was generated through our aircraft ownership program, a focused commercial strategy which includes deposit products, charter flights and aircraft management services. Our aircraft ownership program is an asset-lite model whereby we sell each fleet aircraft to a limited liability company (LLC) and sell LLC membership interests to third-party owners. The LLC then leases the aircraft back to us for management and charter operation on behalf of the LLC under 14 C.F.R. Part 135. In turn, program participants JetShare owners invest in those special purpose entities to fund the aircraft purchase. We operate the aircraft on behalf of the special purpose entity and enters into charter agreements with the individual JetShare owners to provide preferential access and charter pricing for our HondaJet fleet. 
 In September 2024, we announced an agreement with flyExclusive a leading provider of private jet charter services, to transition its fleet operations to flyExclusive. This move is expected to bring substantial cost savings and provide Volato with the opportunity to focus on what it believes to be its high-growth areas, including aircraft sales and proprietary software. We will continue to take delivery of new aircraft, and these aircraft may become part of flyExclusive's managed fleet. Volato will benefit from the margins on aircraft sales without the burden of operational costs, while also generating revenue from its proprietary software, including the Vaunt program, Volato s successful empty leg consumer app. 
 
 Financial highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include: 
 We generated total revenue of 40.3 million an increase of 36.6 million, or 1002 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to an increase from aircraft sales of 38.2 million; 
 Income from continuing operations was 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 3.7 million change from the 1.8 million loss during the prior year primarily related to aircraft sales during the current quarter; and 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of 1.7 million for the same period last year. 
 Financial highlights for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include: 
 We generated total revenue of 44.9 million an increase of 28.9 million, or 182 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to an increase in aircraft sales of 32.4 million; 
 Loss from continuing operations was 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 1.9 million decrease in loss from continuing operations over the prior year primarily related to higher aircraft sales of 32.4 million; and 
 Negative adjusted EBITDA was 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of 4.2 million for the same period last year.

Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations 
 We believe that the following factors have affected our financial condition and results of operations and are expected to continue to have a significant effect: 
 Market Competition 
 We competed for market share in the highly fragmented private aviation industry. The top 10 largest operators control approximately 25 of the total flight hours operated in the United States. For example, there are over 400 light jet operators (excluding air ambulance) offering Part 135 charter services in our primary network service area, flying approximately 293,000 flight hours. The breadth of operators and the product options (fractional, deposit/card programs, charter) makes the industry highly competitive. 
 Costs and Expense Management 
 In 2022 and 2023, we invested in the core business systems, processes and people required to safely operate a rapidly growing, publicly traded private aviation company. In September 2024, we announced an agreement with flyExclusive to transition our fleet operations to flyExclusive. This move is expected to bring substantial cost savings and provide us with the opportunity to focus on what we believe to be our high-growth areas, including aircraft sales and proprietary software. We will continue to take delivery of new aircraft, and these aircraft may become part of flyExclusive s managed fleet. We will benefit from the margins on aircraft sales without the burden of operational costs, while also generating revenue from its proprietary software, including the Vaunt program, our successful empty leg consumer app. 
 Economic Conditions 
 The private aviation industry is volatile and affected by economic cycles and trends. Our financial performance has been susceptible to economically driven changes in demand particularly for our discretionary charter and deposit products. Our cost structure and private aviation demand levels has been greatly impacted by the price of jet fuel, pilot salaries and availability, changes in government regulations, consumer confidence, safety concerns, and other factors. 
 Pilot Availability and Attrition 
 The competition for pilots has intensified in recent years. We have relied on increasing pilot pay and benefits to continue to attract qualified applicants including equity compensation.

 Loss on change in value of forward purchase agreement 
 As part of the Business Combination, we entered into the Forward Purchase Agreement. In July 2024, the Forward Purchase Agreement was terminated. As of September 30, 2024, we recorded a fair value adjustment on the Forward Purchase Agreement resulting in a zero non-cash loss on the change in fair value for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a non-cash loss of 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Expense

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are an addition, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to any performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures of financial results provide useful supplemental information about the Company to investors. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents, including that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Volato s financial measures. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 ADJUSTED EBITDA 
 We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted for (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision for income taxes (benefit) (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) equity-based compensation expense, and other non-operating items. We include Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure for assessing operating performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our principal sources of liquidity have historically consisted of financing activities, including proceeds from the issuance of stock, borrowings under our credit facilities, and capital raises from convertible debt and preferred stock. We additionally manage liquidity through the aircraft sales which provides up front deposits from our customers and aircraft usage. As of September 30, 2024, we had 5.6 million of cash and restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we converted our line of credit from a related party into convertible notes, and therefore have no credit facilities for future borrowings. 
 
 Our primary needs for liquidity are to fund working capital, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and for general corporate purposes. 
 We believe factors that could affect our liquidity include the ability of our OEM partners to meet our delivery schedule and our ability to sell those aircraft, our ability to raise additional funds on favorable terms, the timing and extent of spending on software development and other growth initiatives, our ability to manage our expense, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that our current liquidity is insufficient to fund future activities, we will need to raise additional funds. We may attempt to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, through debt financing arrangements, or both. Raising additional funds by issuing equity securities will dilute the ownership of existing shareholders. The occurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations, and any future instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that could restrict our operations. In the event that additional funds are required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 We have incurred negative cash flows from operating activities and significant losses from operations historically and plan to raise additional capital to fund our future operations. We believe that our current cash position, along with our anticipated margin from aircraft sales and proceeds from future debt and/or equity financings, when combined with prudent cash and expense management, will allow the us continue as a going concern and to fund our operations for at least one year from the date of these financials statements. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.

Table of Contents 

Our inability to raise additional capital or obtain other liquidity on acceptable terms in the near future would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any decline in the market price of our common stock could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time an price that we deem appropriate. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

The cash outflow from operating activities consisted of our net loss of 38.7 million, non-cash items of 3.4 million, and a change in net operating assets and liabilities of 24.2 million. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily as a result of an increase in customer deposits and deferred revenue of 8.9 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 3.0 million.

The cash outflow from operating activities consisted of our net loss of 29.2 million, non-cash items of 21 thousand, and a change in net operating assets and liabilities of 5.1 million. The change in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 2.6 million, an increase in customer deposits and deferred revenue of 4.7 million and a decrease in deposits of 3.9 million. The change in net assets and liabilities for discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 3.9 million.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 Our principal commitments consist of contractual cash obligations under our credit facilities and other loans, operating leases for certain controlled aircraft. We have committed to acquire four (4) Gulfstream G-280 aircraft for total consideration of 79.0 million of which 48 million was funded and paid through September 30, 2024. The first Gulfstream G280 was delivered in the third quarter of 2024 with the remaining three Gulfstream G280s expected to be delivered throughout fiscal year 2025. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain amounts included in or affecting the consolidated financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and related disclosure must be estimated, requiring management to make assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Management believes that the accounting policies set forth below comprise the most important critical accounting policies for the company. A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that involves difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management evaluates such policies on an ongoing basis, based upon historical results and experience, consultation with experts and other methods that management considers reasonable in the particular circumstances under which the judgments and estimates are made, as well as management s forecasts as to the manner in which such circumstances may change in the future. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We determine revenue recognition pursuant to ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, through the following steps: 
 1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer. 
 2. Identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract. 
 3. Determination of the transaction price. 
 4. Allocation of the transaction to the performance obligation(s) in the contract. 
 5. Recognition of revenue when, or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. 
 The Company generates revenue primarily through: (i) the sale of aircraft, and (iii) aircraft management services. 
 The Company generates revenue primarily through: (i) the sale of aircraft, and (ii) aircraft management services. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised service is transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies, as a performance obligation, each promise to transfer a good or service to a customer that is distinct. To identify its performance obligations, the Company considers all of the goods and services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. 
 
 For each revenue stream, we evaluate whether our obligation is to provide the good or service itself, as the principal, or to arrange for the good or service to be provided by the other party, as the agent, using the control model. For certain services provided to the customer, primarily in our aircraft management services revenue stream, the Company directs third-party providers to assist in our fulfillment of the performance obligation in contracts with our customers. Any cost reimbursements and third-party costs are recognized in revenue on a gross basis as Volato has pre-negotiated these costs and takes a certain amount of risk that it will not fully recover the costs incurred. In such circumstances, the Company is primarily responsible for satisfying the overall performance obligation with the customer and is considered the principal in the relationship because the Company has the ability to direct the third parties to provide services to our customers.

Intangible Assets 
 We record our intangible assets acquired in a business combination at cost in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, which was determined based on management s estimate of the period over which the asset will contribute to our future cash flows. We periodically reassess the useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate that useful lives have significantly changed from the previous estimate. 
 We review the intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that they are impaired. These events could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, a decline in operating performance, competition, sale, or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group is determined not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized and a write-down to fair value is recorded. 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. 
 If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, additional impairment testing is not required. We test for goodwill impairment annually during the fourth quarter on October 1. 
 Investment - Equity Method 
 The Company accounts for its equity method investment at cost, adjusted for the Company s share of the investee s earnings or losses, which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company periodically reviews the investment for other than temporary declines in fair value below cost and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. 
 Variable Interest Entity (VIE) Accounting 
 The Company evaluates its ownership, contractual relationships, and other interests in entities to determine the nature and extent of the interests, whether such interests are variable interests and whether the entities are VIEs in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidations. These evaluations can be complex and involve management s judgment as well as the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical information, among other factors. Based on these evaluations, if the Company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, this VIE entity is consolidated into the consolidated financial statements. 
 Revenue is recognized when control of the promised service is transferred to our member or the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. 
 The aircraft ownership program consists of facilitating the formation of limited liability companies owned by third-party members and subsequently selling an aircraft to the limited liability company. Under the aircraft ownership program, a customer can purchase an ownership share in a limited liability company which permits the owner to participate in the aircraft revenue share.

Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The Company recognizes the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of equity awards. This cost is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite vesting period or over the non-employee s period of providing goods or services. Any forfeitures of stock-based compensation are recorded as they occur. 
 The Company utilizes the Black Scholes valuation model to value the issuance of stock-based compensation. See Note 15, Shareholders Equity (Deficit) of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 JOBS Act 
 We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards, delaying the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 
 We may remain an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act or if we have total annual gross revenue of 1.07 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by the report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Management of the Company, including its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by the collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended on September 30, 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Effective in the second quarter of 2024, we no longer have a financial expert on our board of directors.

Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as the same may be amended or restated from time to time (the Certificate of Incorporation ), or these Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, as the same may be amended from time to time (these Bylaws ), the presence, in person or by proxy, at a stockholders meeting of the holders of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Corporation representing one third of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting, except that when specified business is to be voted on by a class or series of stock voting as a class, the holders of shares representing one third of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum of such class or series for the transaction of such business. If a quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 2.6 hereof until a quorum shall attend. The stockholders present at a duly convened meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any such other corporation to vote shares held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
