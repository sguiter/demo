 Acquired other non-current assets includes a sales-type lease receivable and notes receivable with an aggregate fair value of 
 million . The gross amount due under contracts was million , million of which was expected to be uncollectible. 
 The preliminary fair values of intangible assets were generally determined using income-based methods. The income method used for 
 customer relationship intangibles is the multi-period excess earnings method based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows 
 attributable to those assets. The relief from royalty method which the Company has used for the valuation of trade name and certain 
 technology intangibles, estimates fair value by reference to the royalties saved through ownership of the trade name rather than paying 
 a rent or royalty for its use. The fair value of certain technology-based intangibles was determined using a cost savings approach that 
 measures the value of an asset by estimating the cost savings achieved through owning the asset. 
 Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect consideration of other market participants, the amount and 
 timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates, discount rates, cost savings and profitability), royalty rates used in the 
 relief from royalty method, and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and 
 circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions used to calculate the fair values 
 of acquired intangible assets.

The unaudited pro f orma combined financial information above is based on the historical financial statements of Smurfit Kappa, 
 WestRock, and Smurfit Westrock, and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the Merger had 
 occurred on January 1, 2023, nor is it indicative of future results. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been 
 prepared by applying the accounting policies of Smurfit Westrock and includes, where applicable, adjustments for the following 
 factually supportable items or transactions, directly attributable to the Merger: (i) elimination of intercompany activity; (ii) 
 incremental depreciation expense from the preliminary fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment; (iii) amortization 
 expense from the preliminary fair value adjustments to acquired intangible assets; (iv) incremental stock-based compensation expense 
 associated with the Merger; (v) interest expense for acquisition financing and the amortization of the fair value adjustment to debt 
 assumed; (vi) removal of pension and other postretirement amortization expense resulting from the fair value adjustment to acquired 
 WestRock pension and other post-employment benefit assets and liabilities; (vii) changes to align accounting policies; and (viii) 
 associated tax-related impacts of adjustments .

 These pro forma adjustments are based on available information as of the date hereof and upon assumptions that the Company 
 believes are reasonable to reflect the impact of the Merger on the Company s historical financial information on a supplemental pro

 ii. North America , which includes operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
 iii. Latin America LATAM ), which includes operations in Central America and Caribbean, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
 Ecuador and Peru. 
 These changes reflect how we manage our business during the third quarter of 2024, following the completion of the Combination. No 
 operating segments have been aggregated for disclosure purposes. Prior period comparatives have been restated to reflect the change 
 in segments. 
 In the identification of the operating and reportable segments, we considered the level of integration of our different businesses as well 
 as our objective to develop long-term customer relationships by providing customers with differentiated packaging solutions that 
 enhance the customer s prospects of success in their end markets. 
 The Europe, MEA and APAC, North America, and LATAM segments are each highly integrated within the segment and there are 
 many interdependencies within these operations. They each include a system of mills and plants that primarily produce a full line of 
 containerboard that is converted into corrugated containers within each segment, or is sold to third parties. 
 In addition, the Europe, MEA and APAC segment also produces types of paper, such as solid board, sack kraft paper, machine glazed 
 and graphic paper; and other paper-based packaging, such as honeycomb, solid board packaging, folding cartons, inserts and labels; 
 and bag-in-box packaging (located in Europe, Argentina, Canada, Mexico and the U.S.). 
 The North America segment also produces paperboard and specialty grades; other paper-based packaging, such as folding cartons, 
 inserts, labels and displays and also engages in the assembly of displays as well as the distribution of packaging products. 
 The LATAM segment also comprises forestry; types of paper, such as boxboard and sack paper; and paper-based packaging, such as 
 folding cartons, honeycomb and paper sacks. 
 Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to 
 unrelated third parties.

The fair value of the Company's debt with fixed interest rates is based on quoted market prices. With the exception of financial 
 instruments included in the table above, the carrying amounts of all other debt instruments approximate their fair values. The variable 
 nature and repricing dates of the receivables securitization facilities and the revolving credit facility result in a carrying value 
 approximating its fair value. Both the revolving credit facility and the receivables securitization facilities are classified as Level 2 in 
 the fair value hierarchy.

There were no assets or liabilities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, classified as Level 3 in the fair value 
 hierarchy for the periods presented. 
 The fair value of listed financial assets is determined by reference to their bid price at the reporting date. Unlisted financial assets are 
 valued using recognized valuation techniques for the underlying security including discounted cash flows and similar unlisted equity 
 valuation models. 
 The fair value of foreign currency forwards, cross currency swaps and energy hedging contracts is based on their listed market pric e, if 
 available. If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual 
 forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on 
 government bonds). 
 The fair value of natural gas commodity derivatives is estimated based on observable inputs such as commodity future prices. We 
 utilize fixed price natural gas commodity derivatives to mitigate the associated price risk resulting from variability in the NYMEX 
 Henry Hub Index. The notional amount of the Company's natural gas commodity program at September 30, 2024 was million

 For derivative financial instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges, the entire change in fair value of the financial

million for its pro-rata share of PIUMPF s accumulated funding deficiency, including interest. Similarly, in April 2020, 
 WestRock received an updated demand letter related to one of its subsidiaries asserting that it owed million of additional 
 accumulated funding deficiency, including interest. In July 2021, PIUMPF filed suit against Westrock in the U.S. District Court for 
 the Northern District of Georgia claiming the right to recover WestRock s pro rata share of the pension fund s accumulated funding 
 deficiency along with interest, liquidated damages and attorney's fees. The federal court recently ordered the parties to mediate, and 
 the parties have agreed to mediate on November 21, 2024. We believe we are adequately reserved for this matter. 
 In connection with the Combination, we assumed withdrawal liabilities of million (balance of million at September 30, 
 2024 ), including liabilities associated with PIUMPF's accumulated funding deficiency demands. 
 With respect to certain other MEPPs, in the event we withdraw from one or more of the MEPPs in the future, it is reasonably possible 
 that we may incur withdrawal liabilities in connection with such withdrawals. Our estimate of any such withdrawal liabilities, both 
 individually and in the aggregate, are not material for the remaining plans in which we participate. 
 Pension Plan Contributions 
 Established funding standards govern the funding requirements for our qualified and approved pensions in various jurisdictions. We 
 fund the benefit payments of our non-qualified or unfunded plans as benefit payments come due.

of its Brazilian subsidiaries. The matter has proceeded through the 
 Brazil Administrative Council of Tax Appeals CARF principally in proceedings, covering tax years 2003 to 2008 and 2009 to 
 2012. The tax, penalty and interest claims relating to both tax periods were administratively finalized and they are now the subject of 
 two annulment actions WestRock has filed in the Brazil federal court. The fraud penalties and interest for tax years 2003 to 2008 
 remain pending in the court action relating to this period. For tax years 2009 to 2012 the government claim of fraud penalties and 
 interest was resolved and terminated by CARF in favor of WestRock in 2023. 
 We assert that we have no liability in these matters. The total amount in dispute before CARF and in the annulment actions relating to 
 the claimed tax deficiency was R million million as of September 30, 2024 , including various penalties and interest. The 
 U.S. dollar equivalent has fluctuated significantly due to changes in exchange rates. Resolution of the uncertain tax positions could 
 have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations or materially benefit our results of operations in future 
 periods depending upon their ultimate resolution. 
 PIUMPF-Related Litigation 
 Refer to Note 15. Retirement Plans for details of legal proceedings filed by PIUMPF against the Company. 
 Asbestos-Related Litigation 
 We have been named as a defendant in asbestos-related personal injury litigation , primarily in relation to the historical operations of 
 certain companies that have been acquired by the Company. To date, the costs resulting from the litigation, including settlement costs, 
 have not been significant. We accrue for the estimated value of pending claims and litigation costs using historical claims information, 
 as well as the estimated value of future claims based on our historical claims experience. As of September 30, 2024 , there were 
 approximately such lawsuits. We believe that we have substantial insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles and policy 
 limits, with respect to asbestos claims. We also have valid defenses to these asbestos-related personal injury claims and intend to 
 continue to defend them vigorously. Should the Company s litigation profile change substantially, or if there are adverse 
 developments in applicable law, it is possible that the Company could incur significantly more costs resolving these cases. We record 
 asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments 
 concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any 
 pertinent solvency issues surrounding the insurers. The Company does not expect the resolution of pending asbestos litigation and 
 proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, it is 
 possible such proceedings or matters could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash 
 flows. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had recorded liabilities in respect of these matters of million and estimated 
 insurance recoveries of million .

companies, of which Smurfit Kappa 
 Italia, a subsidiary of Smurfit Westrock, was one, that an investigation had found the companies to have engaged in anti-competitive 
 practices, in relation to which the AGCM levied a fine of approximately million on Smurfit Kappa Italia, which was paid in 
 2021. 
 In October 2019, Smurfit Kappa Italia appealed the AGCM s decision to the First Administrative Court of Appeal (TAR Lazio), 
 however Smurfit Kappa Italia was later notified that this appeal had been unsuccessful. In September 2021, Smurfit Kappa Italia filed 
 a further appeal to the Council of State which published its ruling in February 2023. While some grounds of appeal were dismissed, 
 the Council of State upheld Smurfit Kappa Italia s arguments regarding the quantification of the fine. As a result, the AGCM was 
 directed to recalculate Smurfit Kappa Italia s fine. On March 7, 2024, the AGCM notified Smurfit Kappa Italia that its fine had been 
 reduced by approximately million . Smurfit Kappa Italia has appealed the amount of this reduction and a decision on that appeal is 
 expected in 2025. 
 Separate to these proceedings regarding the fine, in May 2023, Smurfit Kappa Italia filed an application with the Council of State for 
 revocation of the February 2023 ruling to the extent that it failed to consider certain pleas that had been raised by Smurfit Kappa Italia 
 on appeal. If successful, the revocation will imply that the Council of State will have to (re-) assess those pleas, which in turn could 
 determine the partial annulment of the August 2019 ACGM decision, although this would not impact the size of the fine levied on 
 Smurfit Kappa Italia. A decision is expected in 2025. 
 After publication of the AGCM s August 2019 decision, a number of purchasers of corrugated sheets and boxes initiated litigation 
 proceedings against Smurfit Kappa companies, alleging that they were harmed by the alleged anti-competitive practices and seeking 
 damages. These actions are still in early stages and Smurfit Westrock cannot predict its potential liability or their outcomes with 
 certainty at this point in time. In addition, other parties have threatened litigation against Smurfit Westrock seeking damages (either 
 specified or unspecified). It cannot be anticipated whether these threatened actions will become actual litigation proceedings, nor 
 whether any amounts claimed will be the same as those that have been threatened. 
 International Arbitration Against Venezuela 
 Smurfit Kappa, which is now a subsidiary of Smurfit Westrock, announced in 2018 that due to the Government of Venezuela s 
 measures, Smurfit Kappa no longer exercised control over the business of Smurfit Kappa Carton de Venezuela. Smurfit Kappa s 
 Venezuelan operations were therefore deconsolidated in the third quarter of 2018. Later that year, Smurfit Kappa s wholly owned 
 subsidiary, Smurfit Holdings BV, filed an international arbitration claim against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela before the 
 World Bank s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes seeking compensation for Venezuela s unlawful seizure of 
 its Venezuelan business as well as for other arbitrary, inconsistent and disproportionate State measures that destroyed the value of its 
 investments in Venezuela. Following the exchange of written submissions, an oral hearing was held in September 2022 in Paris. 
 On 28 August 2024, upon the completion of its deliberations, the arbitral tribunal issued an award granting Smurfit Holdings BV, then 
 a wholly owned subsidiary of Smurfit Westrock, compensation in excess of million , plus legal costs of million , plus interest 
 from May 31, 2024 until the date of payment (the Award . In September 2024 Smurfit Holdings BV initiated proceedings against 
 the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to enforce the Award.

 Timber Note Receivable Securitization Arrangement 
 The Company is also a party to an arrangement involving securitization of its note receivable. Pursuant to the sale of forestlands in 
 2007, a special purpose entity SPE namely MeadWestvaco Timber Notes Holding, LLC MWV TN received an installment 
 note receivable Timber Note ). Using this installment note as collateral, the SPE received proceeds under secured financing 
 agreements, which is recorded as a non-recourse liability. 
 Using the Timber Note as collateral, MWV TN received million in proceeds under a secured financing agreement with a bank. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, the liability from this transaction is non-recourse to the Company and is payable from the Timber 
 Note proceeds upon its maturity in October 2027. As a result, the Timber Note is not available to satisfy any obligations of the 
 Company. MWV TN can elect to prepay at any time the liability in whole or in part, however, given that the Timber Note is not 
 prepayable, MWV TN expects to repay the liability at maturity from the Timber Note proceeds. 
 The Company is the primary beneficiary of MWV TN through various financing arrangements and due to the fact that it is responsible 
 for the entity s most significant economic activities. This entity is considered to be a variable interest entity. 
 The carrying value of the restricted asset and non-recourse liability as of September 30, 2024 approximates fair value due to their

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS OF SMURFIT WESTROCK 
 The following discussion and analysis of Smurfit Westrock s financial condition and results of operations should be read in 
 conjunction with Smurfit Westrock s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and their related notes included above, our 
 audited Consolidated Financial Statements and their related notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 , and Smurfit Kappa s 
 audited Consolidated Financial Statements and their related notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as well as the 
 information under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations of 
 Smurfit Kappa that were disclosed in Smurfit Westrock plc s Smurfit Westrock Registration Statement on Form S-4 (file number 
 333-278185) which was declared effective on April 26, 2024 (as supplemented by the prospectus filed with the SEC on April 26, 2024, 
 the Registration Statement ). This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Smurfit 
 Westrock s future results could differ materially from the results discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such 
 differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors below. 
 Please refer to the section below entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements " for additional information. 
 Smurfit Kappa was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Combination; therefore, the historical consolidated financial 
 statements of Smurfit Kappa for periods prior to the Combination were also considered to be the historical financial statements of the 
 Company. Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company and Smurfit Kappa refer 
 to Smurfit Kappa Group plc and its subsidiaries and their operations when referring to periods prior to the closing of the 
 Combination, and references to the Company and Smurfit Westrock refer to the combined company, Smurfit Westrock plc and its 
 subsidiaries, including, among others, Smurfit Kappa and WestRock, when referring the periods after the Combination. 
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes certain forward-looking statements (including within the meaning of Section 27A of 
 the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) regarding, among other 
 things, the plans, strategies, outcomes, and prospects, both business and financial, of Smurfit Westrock, the expected benefits of the 
 completed Combination of Smurfit Kappa and WestRock Company (including, but not limited to, synergies), and any other statements 
 regarding Smurfit Westrock s future expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, 
 or future events or performance. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the beliefs and expectations of the 
 management of Smurfit Westrock, are forward-looking statements. Words such as may , will , could , should , would , 
 anticipate , intend , estimate , project , plan , believe , expect , target , prospects , potential , commit , forecasts , 
 aims , considered , likely , estimate and variations of these words and similar future or conditional expressions are intended to 
 identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. While the Company believes these 
 expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve 
 known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. By their nature, forward-looking 
 statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend upon future circumstances that may or may not occur. 
 Actual results may differ materially from the current expectations of the Company depending upon a number of factors affecting its 
 business, including risks associated with the integration and performance of the Company following the Combination. Risks, 
 uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to, the 
 factors discussed below under the section entitled Risk Factors below and in subsequent filings with the SEC by the Company. 
 Forward-looking and other statements in this document may also address the Company s corporate responsibility progress, plans, and 
 goals (including environmental matters), and the inclusio n of such statements is not an indication that these contents are necessarily 
 material to investors or required to be disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, historical, 
 current, and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still 
 developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. 
 The Company s forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made. Neither the 
 Company nor any of its associates or directors, officers or advisers provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the 
 occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any such forward-looking statements will actually occur. You are cautioned not to 
 place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations (including 
 under the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, the UK Market Abuse Regulation and other applicable 
 regulations), the Company is under no obligation, and the Company expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or 
 revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

 sales, with operations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Smurfit Westrock partners with its 
 customers to provide differentiated, sustainable paper and packaging solutions that enhance its customers prospects of success in their

 Transaction Agreement and Combination with WestRock 
 On September 12, 2023, Smurfit Kappa, a public company incorporated in Dublin, Ireland, and WestRock, a public company 
 incorporated in Delaware, United States, announced they had reached a definitive agreement on the terms of a proposed combination. 
 As described elsewhere in this report, t he Combination closed on July 5, 2024. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, on the Closing 
 Date each issued ordinary share, par value 0.001 per share, of Smurfit Kappa (a Smurfit Kappa Share was exchanged for one 
 ordinary share, par value 0.001 per share, of Smurfit Westrock (a Smurfit Westrock Share and, in exchange for the net assets of 
 WestRock acquired through the Merger, each share of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, of WestRock (the WestRock 
 Common Stock ), was converted into the right to receive one Smurfit Westrock Share and 5.00 in cash (the Merger Consideration 
 for an aggregate cash consideration of 1,291 million (the Cash Consideration and issuance of 258,228,403 shares to WestRock 
 shareholders. 
 Upon completion of the Combination, Smurfit Kappa and WestRock each became wholly owned subsidiaries of Smurfit Westrock 
 with Smurfit Kappa shareholders owning approximately 50.3 and WestRock shareholders owning approximately 49.7 . Prior to the 
 closing of the Combination, Smurfit WestRock had no operations other than activities related to its formation and the Combination. 
 Given the non-operational nature of the Company prior to the Combination, the Smurfit Kappa Share Exchange is not considered a 
 business combination and does not give rise to any goodwill or adjustments to accounting basis. 
 The consolidated financial statements of Smurfit Westrock following the Smurfit Kappa Share Exchange are a continuation of the 
 financial statements of Smurfit Kappa and therefore, the historical consolidated financial information for periods prior to the 
 Combination including the comparatives presented, reflect the pre-Combination carrying values of Smurfit Kappa except for the 
 retrospective adjustment to reflect the Company s legal share capital as the successor after giving effect to the Smurfit Kappa Share 
 Exchange. 
 The Merger is recognized as a business combination under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805, Business 
 Combinations ASC 805 ). Smurfit Kappa was determined to be the accounting acquirer of WestRock. Accordingly, as noted 
 above, the financial statements reflected in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussions below include 
 WestRock's financial position and results of operations for the period subsequent to the completion of the Combination on July 5, 
 2024. All results reported for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 do not include the financial results of WestRock 
 for the first five days of July. 
 Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the 
 accounting for the Combination. 
 Following the completion of the Combination, we reassessed our reportable segments due to changes in our organizational structure 
 and how our chief operating decision maker CODM makes key operating decisions, allocates resources and assesses the 
 performance of our business. Consequently, subsequent to the Combination, we began to manage the combined business as three 
 reportable segments: (1) Europe, the Middle East and Africa MEA ), and Asia-Pacific APAC ), (2) North America, and (3) Latin 
 America LATAM ). As a result of the change in reportable segments, certain prior year amounts have been recast to conform to the 
 current year presentation. Throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity reflect 
 reclassifications related to the Company's change in reportable segments. Refer to Note 3. Segment Information of the Condensed 
 Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company s segment reporting structure.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 Smurfit Westrock s net sales increased by 4,756 million to 7,671 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 , from 
 2,915 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Net sales increased by 4,339 million to 13,570 million in the nine 
 months ended September 30, 2024 , from 9,231 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in both the three 
 and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was primarily due to the impact of 4,684 million which related to the acquisition of 
 WestRock . 
 Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders decreased by 379 million to a net loss of 150 million in the three months 
 ended September 30, 2024 , from net income of 229 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Net income attributable 
 to common stockholders decreased by 604 million to 173 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 777 million 
 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was 
 primarily due to a n increase in transaction and integration-related expenses associated with the Combination, and an increase in cost of 
 goods sold of 227 million for the amortization of the fair value step up on inventory recognized on WestRock s inventory acquired . 
 Refer to Results of Operations for a detailed review of Smurfit Westrock s performance. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 246 million to 702 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 
 from 948 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due t o a 111 million increase in the outflow in the change 
 in operating assets and liabilities due to additional operating cash flow activity as a result of the acquisition . Additionally, net cash 
 provided by operating activities decreased by 135 million due to a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items, including 
 depreciation, depletion and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income tax, and pension and other 
 postretirement funding more than cost. Du ring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , Smurfit Westrock invested 897 million in 
 capital expenditures and paid 716 million in cash for purchase of businesses, net of cash acquired. The Company also secured 3,127 
 million in additions to debt, partially offset by repayments of 1,640 million of debt, and 493 million in cash dividends were paid to 
 stockholders . See the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources bel o w for additional informa tion.

 three months ended September 30, 2023 . This increase was primarily due to the impact of 4,684 million which related to the

 primarily due to lower energy and raw material costs, partly offset by higher payroll and distribution costs. Energy costs decreased by 
 216 million, primarily due to lower gas and electricity prices. Raw material costs decreased by 44 million primarily due to lower 
 prices, partly offset by higher volumes. Payroll costs increased by 70 million, primarily due to inflationary pay increases and

 expenses of 619 million related to the acquisition of WestRock. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, SG A expenses increased 
 by 38 million driven by a variety of factors, including a 22 million increase in payroll costs driven by inflationary pay increases, 
 partially offset by lower h eadcount and a 31 million increase in share-based payments primarily due to an expense for the 
 incremental fair value on the modification of certain share-based payment awards in connection with the Combination. These 
 increases were partially offset by a 15 million net reduction in other costs.

 of the Combination. 
 Other expense, net, decreased by 6 million i n the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , to 13 million, from 19 million in the 
 nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This decrease was primarily due to a 6 million increase in income from equity method 
 investments; a 6 million increase in the profit from the sale of businesses; and a 7 million net positive impact from foreign currency 
 translation. The decrease in other expense, net was partially offset by 12 million expense recorded in the nine months ended

 of the Combination.

 consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023 , due to a 37 million positive impact from the acquisition of WestRock, 
 offset by a reduction in adjusted EBITDA of 37 million primarily due to a 63 million increase in raw material costs, a 38 million 
 increase payroll costs and 16 million increase in distribution costs, partially offset by a 76 million increase in net sales and an 8 
 million decrease in energy costs. Raw material costs increased by 63 million, primarily due to a 34 million increase from higher

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Smurfit Westrock s primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from its operations, its c ommercial paper program , and 
 committed credit lines. The uncommitted c ommercial paper program is supported by the 4.5 billion New RCF with a separate 
 swingline sub-facility which allows for same-day drawing in U.S. Dollar. The amount of commercial paper outstanding does not 
 reduce available capacity under the New RCF. The primary uses of this liquidity are to fund Smurfit Westrock s day-to-day 
 operations, capital expenditure, debt service, dividends and other investment activity, including acquisitions. 
 On April 3, 2024, Smurfit Kappa Treasury, completed an offering in the aggregate principal amount of 2,750 million of senior 
 unsecured notes in three series, comprised of the following: 750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.200 senior notes due 2030 
 (the 2030 Notes ), 1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 5.438 senior notes due 2034 (the 2034 Notes and 1,000 
 million aggregate principal amount of 5.777 senior notes due 2054 (the 2054 Notes and, together with the 2030 Notes and 2034 
 Notes, the Notes or the Financing (such offering, the Notes Offering ). 
 Net proceeds of the Offering were used to finance the Cash Consideration, fees, commissions, costs and expenses payable in 
 connection with the Combination and for general corporate purposes including the repayment of indebtedness. 
 On June 28, 2024, conditional upon the closing of the Combination, the Company entered into the New Credit Agreement with certain 
 lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as agent, providing for (i) the 600 million Term Loan Facility, (ii) a 
 multicurrency revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 4,500 million including a swingline sub-facility in an 
 aggregate principal amount of 500 million (together, defined above as the New RCF). As of September 30, 2024, there was no 
 amount outstanding under the facility. 
 On July 2, 2024, the Term Loan Facility of 600 million under the New Credit Agreement was cancelled prior to any drawdown and 
 no early termination penalties were incurred as a result of the cancellation. On July 5, 2024, the Company cancelled the 1,350 million 
 Existing RCF as part of the conditions of the New Credit Agreement upon the closing of the Combination on the Closing Date. 
 Additionally, following the Combination and during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Smurfit Westrock repaid or otherwise 
 discharged certain outstanding debt including the following: on July 5, 2024, the Company funded the prepayment and cancellation of 
 the 750 million delayed draw term loan agreement as held by WestRock at that date, on August 12, 2024, the Company redeemed 
 250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due February 2025, and on September 17, 2024, the Company discharged 
 600 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due March 2025. See Note 11. Debt of the Notes to the Condensed 
 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding Smurfit 
 Westrock s debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 The Company believes that the cash flows generated from its operations, cash on hand, its c ommercial paper program , available 
 borrowings under its committed credit lines and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet the 
 Company's liquidity and capital requirements, including payments of any declared common stock dividends, for the next 12 months 
 and for the foreseeable future. 
 Smurfit Westrock is a party to enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to 
 third parties. These obligations impact Smurfit Westrock s short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain 
 contractual obligations are reflected on Smurfit Westrock s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 , while 
 others are considered future obligations . Smurfit Westrock s contractual obligations primarily consist of items such as long-term debt, 
 including current portion, lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations. See the paragraph entitled Contractual 
 Obligations and Commitments for more information. 

54 

As of September 30, 2024 , Smurfit Westrock had 13,964 million of debt, excluding debt issuance costs , of which 753 million was 
 current . The carrying amount of the Company s debt includes a fair value adjustment related to debt assumed through mergers and 
 acquisitions. At September 30, 2024 the unamortized fair value market adjustment was 58 million . As of September 30, 2024 , 
 Smurfit Westrock held cash and cash equivalents of 951 million, of which 493 million were held in Euro, 198 million were held in 
 U.S. dollar, and 260 million were held in other currencies . As of September 30, 2024 , Smurfit Westrock had 18 million of restricted 
 cash which was held in Smurfit Westrock subsidiaries and by a trust which facilitates the operation of Smurfit Westrock s long-term 
 incentive plans. Restricted cash comprises cash held by Smurfit Westrock, which is used as security for specific financing 
 arrangements, and to which Smurfit Westrock does not have unfettered access. As discussed above, on July 5, 2024, Smurfit Kappa 
 paid consideration of 1,291 million for the cash component of the Combination. See the paragraph entitled Overview for additional 
 details. 
 Included within the carrying value of Smurfit Westrock s borrowings as of September 30, 2024 , are debt issuance costs of 45 million, 
 of which 8 million is current, all of which will be recognized in interest expense in Smurfit Westrock s Condensed Consolidated 
 Statement of Operations using the effective interest rate method over the remaining life of the borrowings. 
 At September 30, 2024 , the Company had approximately 4.7 billion in undrawn committed facilities available under the New RCF 
 and receivables securitization facilities. The weighted average period until maturity of undrawn committed facilities was 4.6 years as 
 of September 30, 2024 . Combined with cash and cash equivalents of 951 million, the Company has approximately 5.7 billion 
 liquidity available. 
 Smurfit Westrock uses a variety of working capital management strategies including supply chain financing ("SCF") programs, vendor 
 financing and commercial card programs, monetization facilities where we sell short-term receivables to a group of third-party 
 financial institutions and receivables securitization facilities. The programs are described below. 
 The Company engages in certain customer-based SCF programs to accelerate the receipt of payment for outstanding accounts 
 receivables from certain customers. Certain costs of these programs are borne by the customer or the Company. Receivables 
 transferred under these customer-based SCF programs generally meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales in accordance with 
 guidance under Transfers and Servicing ASC 860 ), resulting in derecognition of such receivables from the Company s 
 consolidated balance sheets. Receivables involved with these customer-based SCF programs constitute approximately 2 of the 
 Company s annual net sales. In addition, Smurfit Westrock has monetization facilities that sell to third-party financial institutions all 
 of the short-term receivables generated from certain customer trade accounts. See Note 10. Fair Value Measurement for a 
 discussion of the Company s monetization facilities. 
 Smurfit Westrock s working capital management strategy includes working with its suppliers to revisit terms and conditions, including 
 the extension of payment terms. The Company s current payment terms with the majority of its suppliers generally range from payable 
 upon receipt to 120 days and vary for items such as the availability of cash discounts. The Company does not believe its payment 
 terms will be shortened significantly in the near future, and does not expect its net cash provided by operating activities to be 
 significantly impacted by additional extensions of payment terms. Certain financial institutions offer voluntary SCF programs that 
 enable the Company s suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from Smurfit Westrock to the financial institutions on 
 a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages the Company s credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to the Company s 
 suppliers. Smurift Westrock and its suppliers agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, 
 quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in SCF programs. The suppliers sell Smurfit 
 Westrock goods or services and issue the associated invoices based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. The due dates of the 
 invoices are not extended due to the supplier s participation in SCF programs. Smurfit Wesrock suppliers, at their sole discretion if 
 they choose to participate in a SCF program, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. No 
 guarantees are provided by the Company under SCF programs and it has no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in 
 the SCF program. Therefore, amounts due to the Company s suppliers that elect to participate in SCF programs are included in the line 
 items accounts payable in the Company s consolidated balance sheets and the activity is reflected in net cash provided by operating 
 activities in the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows. Based on correspondence with the financial institutions that are 
 involved with Smurfit WestRock s two primary SCF programs, while the amount suppliers elect to sell to the financial institutions 
 varies from period to period, the amount generally averages approximately 13 of the Company s accounts payable balance. The 
 outstanding payment obligations to financial institutions under these programs were 432 million as of September 30, 2024. 

55 

Smurfit Westrock also participates in certain vendor financing and commercial card programs to support travel and entertainment 
 expenses and smaller vendor purchases. Amounts outstanding under these programs are classified as debt primarily because the 
 Company receives the benefit of extended payment terms and a rebate from the financial institution that would not have otherwise 
 been received without the financial institution's involvement. Smurfit Westrock also has receivables securitization facilities that allows 
 for borrowing availability based on underlying accounts receivable eligibility and compliance with certain covenants. See Note 11. 
 Debt and Note 18. Variable Interest Entities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the 
 receivables securitization facilities and the amount outstanding under the Company s vendor financing and commercial card programs.

 September 30, 2024 , from 948 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due to a 111 million increase in the 
 outflow in the change in operating assets and liabilities due to additional operating cash flow activity as a result of the acquisition and 
 higher corrugated volumes (excluding acquisitions) in the Europe, MEA and APAC segment . Additionally, net cash provided by 
 operating activities decreased by 135 million due to a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, 
 depletion and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income tax, and pension and other postretirement funding 
 more than cost .

 1,640 million, cash dividends paid to stockholders of 493 million, debt issuance costs of 44 million, changes in commercial paper 
 net of 33 million, purchases of treasury stock of 27 million, and tax paid in connection with shares withheld from employees of 21 
 million . Net cash used for financing activities of 378 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , consisted primarily of 
 cash dividends paid to stockholders of 299 million, repayments of debt of 120 million , and purchases of treasury stock of 30 
 million, and was partially offset by additions to debt of 77 million.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 We summarize our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 , and the effect these obligations 
 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table. Certain amounts in this table are based on 
 management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated 
 actions by third parties and other factors, including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments 
 related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Because these estimates and 
 assumptions are subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future periods may vary from those 
 presented in the table.

(1) Includes only principal payments owed on the Company s debt assuming that all of the long-term debt will be held to maturity, excluding scheduled payments. 
 The Company has excluded 58 million of fair value of debt step-down from the table to arrive at the Company s debt obligations. See Note 11. Debt of the Notes 
 to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 (2) Includes the undiscounted cash flows of operating lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities. See Note 12. Leases of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated 
 Financial Statements for additional information. 
 (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: 
 fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provision; and the approximate timing of the transaction. T hese obligations relate to 
 various purchase agreements for items such as minimum amounts of energy, fiber, and wood purchases over periods ranging from one year to six years. Some of the 
 amounts are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by 
 third parties, and other factors. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty. Because these estimates and assumptions are 
 necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table. 
 (4) Includes future estimated minimum pension plan contributions, multiemployer pension plans MEPP withdrawal payments with definite payout terms and 
 estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. The Company s estimates are 
 based on various factors, such as discount rates and expected returns on plan assets. Future contributions are subject to changes in funded status based on factors such 
 as investment performance, discount rates, returns on plan assets and changes in legislation. It is possible that assumptions may change, actual market performance 
 may vary or Smurfit Westrock may decide to contribute different amounts. The Company has excluded 114 million of MEPP withdrawal liabilities recorded as of 
 September 30, 2024 , including our estimate of the accumulated funding deficiency, due to lack of definite payout terms for certain of the obligations. See Note 15. 
 Retirement Plans of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information .

 Capital Commitments 
 Estimated costs for future purchases of property, plant and equipment that Smurfit Westrock is obligated to purchase as of 
 September 30, 2024 , total approx imately 862 million . 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024 , Smurfit Westrock did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 Definitions 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Smurfit Westrock reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP ). 
 However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures, as discussed below, provide Smurfit Westrock s board of 
 directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with additional meaningful financial information that should be 
 considered when assessing its ongoing performance. Smurfit Westrock management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in 
 making financial, operating and planning decisions, and in evaluating company performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not 
 intended to be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in 
 accordance with GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial 
 measures Smurfit Westrock presents may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies. Smurfit Westrock 
 uses the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Basic. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Smurfit Westrock uses the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its overall performance. The composition of 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not addressed or prescribed by GAAP. Smurfit Westrock defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before 
 income taxes , depreciation, depletion and amortization , interest expense, net , pension and other postretirement non-service (benefit) 
 expense, net , share-based compensation expense , other expense, net , impairment of goodwill and other assets, amortization of fair 
 value step up on inventory , transaction and integration-related expenses associated with the Combination , restructuring costs, 
 legislative or regulatory fines and reimbursements and losses at closed facilities. Smurfit Westrock views Adjusted EBITDA as an 
 appropriate and useful measure used to compare financial performance between periods. 
 Management believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is Net (loss) income . Management 
 believes this measure provides Smurfit Westrock s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts 
 and others with useful information to evaluate Smurfit Westrock s performance because, in addition to income tax expense, 
 depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, interest expense, net, pension and other postretirement non-service (benefit) 
 expense, net, and share-based compensation expense, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes restructuring costs, impairment of goodwill 
 and other assets and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the operating results of the business . Smurfit 
 Westrock and its board of directors use this information in making financial, operating and planning decisions and when evaluating 
 Smurfit Westrock s performance relative to other periods. 
 Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA to Net (loss) income , the most directly 
 comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicate d.

 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share - Basic 
 Smurfit Westrock uses the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Basic . 
 Management believes these measures provide Smurfit Westrock s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, 
 securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate Smurfit Westrock s performance because they exclude transaction 
 and integration-related expenses associated with the Combination and other specific items that management believes are not indicative 
 of the operating results of the business. Smurfit Westrock and its board of directors use this information when making financial, 
 operating and planning decisions and when evaluating Smurfit Westrock s performance relative to other periods. Smurfit Westrock 
 believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measures to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - Basic are Net 
 (loss) income attributable to common stockholders and basic earnings per share attributable to common stockholders Earnings Per 
 Share - Basic ). 
 Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Net Income to Net (loss) income attributable to

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 We have prepared our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires 
 management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities reported. Significant accounting 
 policies are described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes, and in the 
 Notes of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements of Smurfit Kappa. There have been no material changes during the three months 
 ended September 30, 2024, to Smurfit Westrock s critical accounting policies and estimates as identified by Smurfit Kappa. 
 
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 See Note 1 . Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to t he Condensed Consolidated 
 Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption 
 and expected effects on Smurfit Westrock s results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is shown in the Registration Statement, which 
 information is incorporated herein by reference. There have been no material changes in Smurfit Westrock s exposure to market risk 
 as identified in the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements of Smurfit Kappa since December 31, 2023. 

60 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Smurfit Westrock s management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures 
 (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to 
 be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the 
 Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as 
 appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed by the Company 
 to ensure that it records, processes, summarizes and reports in a timely manner the information it must disclose in reports that it files 
 with or submits to the SEC. Anthony Smurfit, President and Group Chief Executive Officer, and Ken Bowles, Executive Vice 
 President and Group Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in management s evaluation of the disclosure controls and 
 procedures. 
 Based on this evaluation, Mr. Smurfit and Mr. Bowles concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, 
 Smurfit Westrock s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the material weakness in our internal control 
 over financial reporting described below. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there 
 is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a 
 timely basis. 
 As discussed elsewhere in this report, on July 5, 2024, we completed the Combination between Smurfit Kappa and WestRock. Prior to 
 the Combination, Smurfit Kappa, as a public limited company incorporated in Ireland and listed on the London Stock Exchange and 
 on the Euronext Dublin Market, was not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 SOX ), while WestRock, as a 
 U.S. publicly traded company incorporated in Delaware and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, was subject to Section 404 of 
 SOX. Upon the completion of the Combination Smurfit Kappa and WestRock became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Smurfit 
 Westrock. 
 As a result of the Combination, Smurfit Westrock s management is in the process of integrating Smurfit Kappa and WestRock s 
 legacy internal control frameworks. In connection with Smurfit Westrock s assessment of its internal control over financial reporting 
 for the purposes of complying with Section 302 of SOX, we have identified a material weakness relating to the company s selection 
 and development of control activities intended to mitigate the risks to achieving its objectives. This relates to certain processes and 
 controls principally at historical Smurfit Kappa that were not subject to the requirements of Section 404 of SOX prior to the 
 Combination. 
 This material weakness resulted in: 
 A lack of formalization of an existing control process for documenting evidence of management review and performance of 
 control procedures, including the level of precision in the execution of controls and procedures to ascertain completeness and 
 accuracy of information produced by the Company. 
 Existing controls related to the preparation and review of manual journal entries not designed to adequately mitigate the 
 associated risks. 
 The need to augment General IT Controls, specifically as they pertain to (i) logical access controls to ensure appropriate 
 segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data to 
 appropriate Company personnel and (ii) program change management controls to ensure that information technology 
 program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, 
 authorized and implemented appropriately. 
 Notwithstanding the identified material weakness, management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements and 
 related financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial 
 position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented. 

61 

Remediation Plan 
 We have begun the process of designing and implementing remediation measures in respect of this material weakness and to improve 
 our internal control over financial reporting. These remediation measures include a number of actions: 
 designing and implementing policies and guidance related to the operation of controls; 
 developing appropriate controls over the review of manual journal entries; and 
 enhancing and expanding across the organization the general IT processes and controls. 
 In addition, control operators have participated in SOX training sessions, with a specific focus on the formalization of review 
 procedures performed in executing controls. 
 While we are working to remediate the identified deficiencies as timely and efficiently as possible, we cannot yet provide an estimate 
 of the time it will take to complete this remediation plan. The implementation of our remediation measures will require validation and 
 testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period. In addition, we cannot ensure that the 
 measures taken by us to date, and actions that we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate these deficiencies or that they 
 will prevent or avoid potential future deficiencies. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the changes that may continue to result from the integration following the Combination and remediation actions described 
 above, there has been no change in Smurfit Westrock s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 
 13a15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the third quarter 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to 
 materially affect, Smurfit Westrock s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 17 , Commitments and Contingencies, 
 included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements (unaudited) Notes to Condensed Combined Financial Statements included herein. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Risk Factor Summary 
 The following summary is intended to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures. We encourage you to 
 carefully review the full risk factors discussed below in their entirety for additional information. Some of the factors that could 
 adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares, include: 
 Market and Industry Risks 
 
 A s a leading global manufacturing business, we have been, and may be materially adversely affected by economic, 
 geopolitical and social factors that are beyond our control. 
 We may be adversely affected by uncertainty, downturns, actions taken by competitors or other changes in the paper and 
 packaging industry. 
 Our earnings are highly dependent on demand. 
 Price fluctuations in, or shortages in the availability of, energy, transportation and raw materials could materially adversely 
 affect our business. 
 We are exposed to significant competition in the containerboard and packaging industry, which may be materially and 
 adversely affect the price and volume of products sold. 

62 

Operating Risks 
 We may experience business disruptions that adversely affect our operations. 
 We may fail to anticipate trends and develop or integrate new technologies or to protect intellectual property related to our 
 products and technologies. 
 Our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be completed at a higher cost than anticipated. 
 We are exposed to risks related to our international sales and operations. 
 We could be exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuation risks. 
 We may produce faulty or contaminated products due to failures in quality control measures. 
 We are subject to cybersecurity risks that could threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data in our systems, 
 and could result in disruptions to our operations. 
 We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters. 
 We may not be able to attract, motivate and/or retain qualified personnel, including our key personnel. 
 We face challenges associated with sustainability matters, including climate change and scarce resources. 
 Failure by us to successfully implement strategic transformation initiatives, including those relating to information 
 technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. 
 If we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions or if disposals result in unexpected costs or liabilities, our business could be 
 materially and adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to the Combination 
 We may not realize all of the benefits of the recent Combination or such benefits may take longer than anticipated or may be 
 lower than estimated. 
 We may fail to successfully integrate Smurfit Kappa and WestRock, including their individual cultures and philosophies. 
 We have incurred and will incur significant costs as a result of becoming subject to various U.S. laws and regulations, 
 including U.S. securities laws and reporting requirements. 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in 
 material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations 
 We will be required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and may incur significant costs and devote substantial 
 management time towards developing and maintaining adequate internal controls, which may materially adversely affect our 
 operating results in the future. 
 Changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices may have a material adverse effect on our results of 
 operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 Financial Risks 
 Our continued growth depends on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. 
 Our debt could adversely affect our financial health. 
 Adverse credit and financial market events and conditions, as well as credit rating downgrades, could, among other things, 
 impede access to or increase the cost of financing. 
 We have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a write-down could materially adversely impact our 
 operating results. 
 We have a number of pension arrangements that are currently in deficit and may incur additional liability and/or increased 
 funding requirements in connection with multi-employer pension plans. 
 Any dividend payment in respect of our shares is subject to a number of factors, and there are no guarantees that the 
 Company will pay dividends or the level of any such dividends. 

63 

Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other requirements that may change or may impose substantial 
 compliance costs. 
 We are subject to a growing number of environmental and climate change laws and regulations. 
 We are subject to compliance with antitrust and similar legislation in areas where we operate. 
 We are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to privacy, security and data protection, and failure to comply 
 could lead to fines and/or litigation. 
 Failure to comply with applicable occupational health and safety and environmental laws and regulations may have a material 
 adverse effect on our business. 
 The Company s maintenance of two exchange listings may adversely affect liquidity in the market for our shares and result in 
 pricing differentials of our shares between the two exchanges. 
 Risks Related to Our Incorporation in Ireland 
 We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. As a result , shareholders may have less 
 protection, and we are required to comply with, and are subject to, certain Irish laws in respect of certain actions and 
 decisions, including certain capital decisions, dividends, certain tax matters and anti-takeover protections available to us. 
 Market and Industry Risks 
 As a leading global manufacturing business, we have been, and may be in the future, materially adversely affected by factors that 
 are beyond our control, such as economic and financial market conditions, geopolitical conflicts and other social and political 
 unrest or change . 
 Our industry has been, and may be, adversely affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited 
 to: 
 macroeconomic and business conditions, including deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and related supply and demand 
 dynamics, as well as inflation and deflation; 
 geopolitical conflicts and other social and political unrest or change; 
 sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements; 
 conditions in the financial services markets, including counterparty risk, insurance carrier risk, rising interest rates, rising 
 commodity prices, and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may impact price and demand for our products; 
 financial uncertainties in our major international markets; 
 government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in 
 which we operate; and 
 cyber incidents and related threats to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data in systems. 
 The outlook for the global economy in the near- to medium-term remains uncertain and we are unable to predict the timing or rate at 
 which economic conditions in our markets may change and the impact of such changes. For example, if the economic climate were to 
 deteriorate as a result of geopolitical events (such as the Russian war in Ukraine or the conflict in the Middle East) or geopolitical 
 uncertainty, trade tensions and/or a pandemic, it could result in an economic slowdown which, if sustained over any significant length 
 of time, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our 
 ordinary shares. In addition, changes in trade policies, including renegotiating, or potentially terminating, existing bilateral or 
 multilateral agreements, as well as the imposition of tariffs, could impact demand for our products and the costs associated with 
 operating our business, including certain of our capital investments. The global economy also continues to experience elevated levels 
 of inflation, and we experienced cost inflation across our business in fiscal 2023 and early in 2024, albeit at moderating levels since 
 fiscal 2022. Persistent inflation results in higher manufacturing and transportation costs, which we may not be able to recover through 
 higher prices charged to our customers. 

64 

We also cannot predict the timing or duration of any downturn in the economy that may occur in the future. In addition, changes to or 
 withdrawals from free trade agreements and the implementation of tariffs, border taxes or other measures that can limit international 
 trade may have a negative impact on manufacturing and production levels of businesses and customers in the markets in which we 
 operate, which may in turn decrease demand for our products. 
 Unanticipated events such as global conflicts, public health crises, extraordinary weather events, labor disputes or strikes, and cyber 
 incidents may cause instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets. This instability could lead to volatility in the value of 
 our operating and functional currencies, hinder the availability of financing from our current lenders. 
 Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares could be further adversely 
 affected, perhaps materially, by any of these matters. 
 We may be adversely affected by uncertainty, downturns, actions taken by competitors (such as the addition of new capacity) or 
 other changes in the paper and packaging industry; in addition, the cyclical nature of the paper and packaging industry could 
 result in overcapacity and depress prices for our products . 
 We are highly dependent on the market dynamics of the paper and packaging industry. We could therefore be materially adversely 
 affected by negative developments, uncertainty, downturns and changes in the paper and packaging industry as a whole or in part, as 
 well as by the addition of new capacity by our competitors. A lack of investor confidence in the paper and packaging industry could 
 also have an adverse effect on the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 Our operating results are impacted by the paper and packaging industry s historical cyclical investment pattern. This cyclicality arises, 
 in part, from the capital intensity of facilities such as paper mills (which generally continue production as long as paper prices are 
 sufficient to cover their marginal costs), the lead time between the planning and completion of a new mill and the fact that new 
 additions of containerboard and paperboard capacity tend to be large relative to the overall demand for the product. In addition, there 
 is the potential to convert certain other paper machines into containerboard machines, which may contribute to overcapacity. 
 Consequently, the industry has from time-to-time experienced periods of substantial overcapacity and there can be no assurance that 
 this will not reoccur. 
 In the absence of sufficient economic growth to generate increased demand or the closure of facilities (either temporarily or 
 permanently) to mitigate the effect, new capacity can cause a period of regional overcapacity which may lead to downward pricing 
 pressure. 
 These adverse effects could be further exacerbated if producers in other regions (particularly China) experience overcapacity within 
 their own local and regional markets and seek to increase their levels of exports into those markets within which we operate and do so 
 at lower pricing levels. The effect of such activity would be to depress prices for our products and could materially adversely affect 
 our selling prices and profitability. 
 We believe that the trading price of our ordinary shares has been adversely affected in part due to the impact of macroeconomic 
 conditions on pricing and demand and announcements by certain of our competitors of planned additional capacity in the North 
 American containerboard market, as well as the subsequent implementation of certain of those plans and the impact it will have on 
 future supply and demand dynamics and pricing. 
 In addition, many of our customer contracts include price adjustment provisions based upon published indices (including those 
 published by Pulp and Paper Week PPW )) for our products that contribute to the setting of selling prices for some of our products. 
 PPW is a limited survey that may not accurately reflect changes in market conditions for our products. Changes in how these indices 
 are determined or maintained, or other indices are established or maintained, could adversely impact the selling prices for these 
 products. If published containerboard and paperboard index prices decline in a period, such changes will result in lower prices, and 
 likely lower profitability, for certain of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and 
 financial condition.

Our earnings are highly dependent on demand . 
 Because our operations generally have high fixed operating costs, and pricing movements can be triggered, at times, by imbalances 
 between supply and demand, our earnings are highly dependent on demand, which tends to fluctuate due to macroeconomic 
 conditions, dynamics in the markets we serve, and due to company- and customer-specific issues. For example, through 2023 and 
 2024, we have been experiencing lower demand due to factors such as, but not limited to, challenging macroeconomic conditions, 
 certain customer inventory rebalancing and shifting consumer spending. These fluctuations at times lead to significant variability in 
 our sales, results of operations and cash flow , making it difficult to predict our financial results with certainty. 
 The extent of the impact of public health crises, including a pandemic, or related containment measures and government responses, are 
 highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including as it relates to demand and volume for our products and could therefore adversely 
 affect our operational and financial performance. 
 Price fluctuations in, or shortages in the availability of, energy, transportation and raw materials could materially adversely affect 
 our business . 
 Our margins are significantly affected by the prices that we are able to charge for our products and the costs of the raw materials we 
 require to make these products. Our primary raw materials are recovered fiber, particularly old corrugated containers OCC ), and 
 wood fiber. The prices for these raw materials tend to be volatile, and price fluctuations affect our margins. 
 OCC and wood fiber are used in the manufacture of our paper-based packaging products and are purchased in increasingly 
 competitive, price-sensitive markets. OCC prices are based on market prices that have historically exhibited price and demand 
 cyclicality and significant price volatility over short periods and may do so again in the future. In particular, the price of OCC depends 
 on a variety of factors over which we have no control, including demand from outside our countries of operation, environmental and 
 conservation regulations, natural disasters and weather. Despite owning our own recycling depots to independently source OCC 
 supplies, from a price perspective, OCC prices are linked to official reference prices and are therefore based on market prices. 
 Historically, these market prices have exhibited significant price volatility. 
 Prices of wood fiber are also impacted by many of these factors. A decrease in the supply of such raw materials has caused, and any 
 such decrease in the future can be expected to cause, higher costs. In addition, the increase in demand for products manufactured, in 
 whole or in part, from OCC has in the past caused an occasional supply or demand imbalance in the market for OCC. It may also 
 cause a significant increase in the cost of wood fiber used in the manufacture of recycled containerboard and related products. Asian 
 purchasers have been in the OCC market for a number of years and have become material purchasers in the sector due to significant 
 ongoing expansion of their recycled containerboard mills capacity. The effect of this has been to create volatility with respect to the 
 price of OCC. Our raw material costs are likely to continue to fluctuate based upon supply and demand characteristics. 
 In response to growing pressure from increased environmental awareness and the need to comply with environmental emission targets, 
 a number of northern European governments have sought to encourage the use of wood for energy generation purposes through the 
 use of subsidies. These policies create a new source of demand for wood. This has the effect of increasing the price of wood fiber and 
 consequently the cost of our raw materials for the production of kraftliner. If this trend continues or grows, this could lead to further 
 raw material price increases and could have a material adverse effect on our margins. 
 Many of our customer contracts contain price adjustment clauses allowing us to pass increased costs on to our customers. However, 
 not all of our agreements contain these clauses and these clauses may not in all cases be effective to offset our increased costs. Where 
 we are able to raise prices there is generally a three- to six-month lag between the time our raw material prices increase and the time 
 we realize increased pricing from our customers. 

66 

Certain of the Company s paper mills are subject to regulation under regulatory programs that mandate reductions in greenhouse gas 
 emissions, including the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, Quebec s Regulation respecting a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas 
 emission allowances, and, in the United States, the Washington Climate Commitment Act, whereby covered businesses are issued 
 emissions allowances based on an annual limit or cap on greenhouse gas emissions and are required to have a sufficient number of 
 allowances to cover their annual greenhouse gas emissions. If a business greenhouse gas emissions exceed its available allowances, it 
 may be required to make capital investments or other expenditures to reduce emissions, or it may be required to buy additional 
 allowances on the market, at government auctions, or from other program participants. Failure to have a sufficient number of 
 allowances available may subject a business to penalties. As part of an energy-intensive, trade-exposed sector, the Company s paper 
 mills that are subject to existing cap-and-trade regulations are entitled to receive a certain number of greenhouse gas emission 
 allowances at no cost to ease the energy transition. To date, the number of no-cost allowances granted to our mills has been sufficient 
 to cover our compliance obligations; however, there is a risk that in the future we will not have enough free allowances to meet our 
 compliance requirements. If we are required to make investments to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, such as switching fuels to 
 lower carbon alternatives, or purchase allowances, these costs may not be recoverable through higher prices for our products and could 
 negatively affect our operations, financial condition and cash flows. Failure to meet our greenhouse gas obligations could result in 
 fines, penalties and potential damage to our business reputation. We also face risks that more of the Company facilities could become 
 subject to cap-and-trade programs or similar greenhouse gas reduction mandates in the future and that these programs or mandates 
 could significantly increase our energy and other input costs in these jurisdictions. Our production processes are energy intensive. If 
 energy prices increase in the future, this would increase our production costs, which could consequently have a material adverse effect 
 on our profitability. 
 We distribute our products primarily by truck, rail and sea. The reduced availability of trucks, rail cars or cargo ships, including as a 
 result of labor shortages in the transportation industry, could adversely impact our ability to distribute our products in a timely or cost- 
 effective manner. Higher transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products 
 offered by competitors. 
 The failure to obtain raw materials, energy or transportation services at reasonable market prices (or the failure to pass on price 
 increases to customers) or a reduction in the availability of raw materials, energy or transportation services due to increased demand, 
 significant changes in climate or weather conditions or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of 
 operations, financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 We are exposed to significant competition in the paper and packaging industry, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our results of 
 operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares, could be adversely affected . 
 We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. The paper and packaging industry is characterized by a high level of 
 price competition, as well as other competitive factors including innovation, design, quality and service. To the extent that any of 
 our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our business, results of operations, financial 
 condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares could be materially adversely affected. Pricing pressure could arise from, 
 among other things, limited demand growth in the market in question, price reductions by competitors, entry of new competitors 
 into the markets in which we operate, the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale and create excess 
 product supply, the ability of competitors to operate or successfully relocate or open production facilities in countries where 
 production costs are lower than those in which we operate and the introduction by our competitors of new products, 
 technologies and equipment, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions. 
 Our products also compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including products made of plastics, wood and 
 various types of metal. Customer shifts away from paper packaging to packaging made from other materials could adversely affect our 
 results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 

67 

Operating Risks 
 We may experience business disruptions that adversely affect our operations . 
 We depend on continuous operation of our facilities. The operations at our facilities have in the past and may in the future be 
 interrupted or impaired by various operating risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with: 
 catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, explosions, natural disasters, severe weather, including hurricanes, 
 tornadoes and droughts, and pandemics, such as COVID-19, or other health crises or similar occurrences; 
 interruptions in the delivery of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs; 
 failure of third-party service providers and/or business partners to fulfill their commitments and responsibilities in a timely 
 manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms; 
 government regulations; 
 prolonged power failures; 
 unscheduled maintenance outages, including due to equipment breakdowns or failures; 
 information system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes, including cyber incidents; 
 violations of our permit requirements or revocation of permits; 
 releases of pollutants and hazardous substances to air, soil, surface water or ground water; 
 disruptions in transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels; 
 shortages of equipment or spare parts; and 
 labor disputes, strikes and shortages. 
 Business disruptions have impaired, and may in the future impair, our production capabilities and adversely affect our results of 
 operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares. For example, operations at several of our 
 facilities located in the south and southeastern U.S. have been interrupted in recent years by hurricanes and severe winter weather, 
 resulting in, among other things, lost mill production. In addition, the impact of any future public health crises, including a 
 pandemic, or other business disruptions, on our operational and financial performance in future periods will depend on future 
 developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our production capabilities may be disrupted if we are unable to 
 secure sufficient supplies of raw materials or if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively as a result of a 
 business disruption. We have contingency plans and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles or retentions, policy limits and 
 other conditions, that we use to seek to mitigate the impact of business disruptions; however, we may not be successful with respect to 
 those mitigation efforts or any claim regarding insurance coverage and, if we are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance 
 may not be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses. 
 Smurfit Westrock has 30 mills in North America, with the capacity to produce close to 14.8 million tons of paper per year, including 
 14 mills that each have the capacity to produce more than 0.5 million tons of paper per year. In Europe/MEA/APAC, we have 23 
 mills, including seven mills that each have the capacity to produce 0.5 million tons or more of paper and board per year, compared 
 with our overall capacity of around 7.6 million tons. In Latin America, we have nine mills with a total capacity of around 1.6 million 
 tons, including one mill that has the capacity to produce more than 0.5 million. If operations at any of these key mills were interrupted 
 for any significant length of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and 
 the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 We may fail to anticipate trends and develop or integrate new technologies that would enable us to offer products that respond to 
 changing customer preferences or to protect intellectual property related to our products and technologies . 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to offer differentiated solutions, and we must continually develop and introduce new 
 products and services to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments and changing customer preferences. The services 
 and products that we offer customers may not meet their needs as their business models evolve. Also, our customers may decide to 
 decrease their use of our products, use alternative materials for their product packaging or forego the packaging of certain products 
 entirely. Regulatory developments can also significantly alter the market for our products. For example, a move to electronic 
 distribution of disclaimers and other paperless regimes could adversely impact our healthcare inserts and labels businesses. Similarly, 
 certain states and local governments have adopted laws banning single- use paper bags or charging businesses or customers fees to use 
 paper bags. These and similar developments could adversely impact demand for certain of our products. 

68 

Customer preferences for products and packaging formats are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience, 
 and health and sustainability concerns and perceptions. Also, there is an increasing focus among consumers to ensure that products 
 delivered through e-commerce are packaged efficiently. In addition, customers are increasingly interested in the carbon footprint of 
 our products, and future packaging developments and trends may drive further substitution. Our results of operations, cash flows and 
 financial condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares, could be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate and address these 
 and other trends, including by developing and offering products that respond to changing customer preferences, or if there is a ny 
 significant substitution away from paper-based packaging products . 
 In addition, creating or adopting new or complementary technologies and subsequently integrating them may be costly and difficult. 
 We have been involved in trialing new and evolving technology, but doing so may require significant investments of capital, and such 
 innovations are subject to long lead times and failure. Trialing such technology can take an extended period of time, with little to no 
 returns in the short or medium terms. Any such risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, 
 financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 Our success also depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection for certain proprietary packaging products and 
 packaging machine technologies used to produce our products. Failure to protect our existing intellectual property may result in the 
 loss of valuable legal rights. Our competitors may obtain intellectual property rights that could require us to license those rights or to 
 modify or cease the use or sale of certain of our technologies or products. Our patents could be invalidated, rendered unenforceable, 
 circumvented, challenged or licensed to others, and our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the 
 claims we seek, if at all. Further, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate 
 our technologies or design around our patents, and steps we take to protect our technologies may not prevent misappropriation of those 
 technologies. 
 Our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be completed at a higher cost than anticipated . 
 We operate in a capital-intensive industry and undertake expansion projects to either support growth in our business or improve the 
 breadth and quality of our product offerings, including investments in both mill and converting operations. Many of our capital 
 projects are complex, costly and/or implemented over an extended period of time. Our expenditures for capital projects could be 
 higher than anticipated, we may experience unanticipated business disruptions or delays in completing the projects and/or we may not 
 achieve the desired benefits from those projects, including as a result of a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or in our 
 business, unavailability of capital equipment or related materials, delays in obtaining permits or other requisite approvals or changes in 
 laws and regulations. In addition, disputes between us and contractors who are involved with implementing capital projects could lead 
 to time-consuming and costly litigation. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and 
 financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 

69 

We are exposed to risks related to international sales and operations . 
 We operate in many different countries. As of September 30, 2024, we operated across 40 countries. As a result, we have previously 
 been and remain vulnerable to risks in these countries, including: 
 the imposition of tariffs, quotas, import duties or other market barriers, such as restrictions on repatriating cash from foreign 
 countries; 
 responding to disruptions in existing trade agreements or increased trade tensions between countries or political and 
 economic unions; 
 the difficulties of, and costs of complying with, a wide variety of complex and changing laws, treaties and regulations; 
 increased difficulty in the collection of accounts receivable, including longer collection periods; 
 import and export restrictions and other trade barriers; 
 inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in legislation or regulatory requirements and increased difficulty and 
 expense in hiring and dismissing employees; 
 the imposition of quotas relating to the composition of the employee base or the local sourcing of raw materials or other 
 similar quotas; 
 political, economic and social unrest or instability (such as downturns or changes in economic activity due to, among other 
 things, regional conflicts or commodity inflation), the ongoing hyperinflation in Argentina (which has led us to apply 
 hyperinflationary accounting to our Argentinian operations in recent years), as well as disruptions and government 
 intervention in national economies and social structures, including the threat of terrorism; 
 geopolitical conflict, such as of the war in Ukraine, which led us to sell our Russian operations and take a related impairment 
 charge of 159 million in respect of our Russian operations in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022; 
 work stoppages, transport interruptions and difficulties in managing international operations; 
 government limitations on foreign ownership or takeovers, expropriation of private sector assets or mandated price controls; 
 transfer pricing and adverse tax policies; and 
 adverse currency fluctuations. 
 We are subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where we operate. We have several ongoing audit examinations and disputes that 
 generally cover multiple years with various tax authorities. We base our tax returns on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations in 
 effect; however, governing tax bodies have in the past and may in the future disagree with certain of our tax positions, which could 
 result in a higher tax liability. See Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial 
 Statements for discussion of an ongoing tax liability matter in Brazil. 
 The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our earnings as a result of the related delays or 
 increased costs in the production and delivery of products and services or otherwise disrupt the demand for our products. Any of these 
 circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary 
 shares. 

70 

We could be exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuation risks . 
 We have operations in a number of countries. As such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on our 
 financial statements. Direct impacts include the translation of international operations local currency financial statements into U.S. 
 dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. Indirect impacts include 
 the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the United States (and the impact on local currency pricing of 
 products that are traded internationally). 
 Our current exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuation arises mainly in relation to our operations in the Eurozone. These 
 operations represented 37.3 of our net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar is important for the industry in which we operate in both Europe and 
 Latin America because U.S. containerboard and paperboard prices tend to influence the world market. A weak U.S. dollar over a 
 sustained period could result in lower imports into the United States of goods shipped in corrugated containers and, as a result, lower 
 demand for our containers. A weak U.S. dollar could also result in additional competition in our European and Latin American 
 markets from U.S. manufacturers that have an incentive to export more products due to increased demand for relatively lower priced 
 U.S. goods. 
 We may produce faulty or contaminated products due to failures in quality control measures and systems, which could negatively 
 impact our business and share price . 
 We may fail to produce products that meet applicable safety and quality standards, which could result in adverse effects on consumer 
 health, litigation exposure, loss of market share and adverse reputational and financial impacts, among other potential consequences, 
 and we may incur substantial costs in taking appropriate corrective action (up to and including recalling products from end consumers 
 and reimbursing customers and/or end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of these failures). Our failure to meet these 
 standards could lead to regulatory investigations, enforcement actions and/or prosecutions, and could result in adverse publicity, which 
 may damage our reputation. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, 
 financial condition and the trading of our ordinary shares. 
 We provide representations in certain of our contracts that our products are produced in accordance with customer specifications. If 
 the product contained in packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated, the manufacturer of the product may allege that the 
 packaging we provided caused the fault or contamination, even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications. If our 
 packaging fails to meet contract specifications, we could face liability from our customers and third parties for bodily injury or other 
 damages. These liabilities could adversely affect our operations, cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our 
 ordinary shares. 
 We are subject to cybersecurity risks that could threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data in our systems, and 
 could result in disruptions to our operations and adversely affect our operations, cash flows and financial condition . 
 Cybersecurity incidents could compromise our information technology or data and expose us to liability, which would cause our 
 business and reputation to suffer. We rely on various technologies, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit 
 and store electronic information. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual 
 property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable 
 information of our customers and employees, in our information technology. We also collect and store limited, non-sensitive customer 
 personally identifiable information. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our 
 operations. The current cyber threat environment presents enhanced risk for all companies, including those in our industry. The rapid 
 evolution and increased availability of artificial intelligence may intensify cybersecurity risks by making targeted attacks more 
 convincing and cybersecurity incidents more difficult to detect, contain, and mitigate. 

71 

Despite our security measures, our information technology, and that of our third-party providers and business partners, is subject to 
 recurring attempts by threat actors to access information, manipulate data or disrupt operations. Information technology that we, third- 
 party providers and business partners use may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or outages by common hackers, criminal groups, nation- 
 state organizations or social activist organizations (whose efforts may increase as a result of geopolitical events and political and social 
 unrest or instability around the world) due to insider threat, malfeasance or other disruptions, such as cyber-attacks, power outages, 
 telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service provider failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The 
 significant increase in remote working and the continued expansion of the integrated supply chain increase the risks of cyber incidents 
 and the improper dissemination of personal or confidential information. Any such breach could compromise our information 
 technology and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, potentially resulting in legal claims or 
 proceedings and regulatory penalties. In addition, any such outage could disrupt or temporarily halt our operations resulting in reduced 
 productivity, staff downtime, and increased insurance premiums, as well as additional costs for attempting to recover lost information, 
 equipment or data, and could damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, 
 financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 We may also face challenges and risks during integration of acquired businesses and operations, as we and the acquired businesses and 
 operations may face increased targeted attempts during this busy period. While we maintain plans and processes to prevent or mitigate 
 the impact of these events, these events could nonetheless result in disruptions and damage. In addition, as a result of the foregoing, 
 we could experience adverse publicity, loss of sales, the cost of remedial measures, including substantial legal fees, and significant 
 expenditures to reimburse third parties for damages, each of which could adversely impact our results of operations. Any insurance we 
 maintain against the risk of this type of loss may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, may not apply to the circumstances relating to 
 any particular loss, or may become materially more costly over time. As a result, any or all of the above events could adversely affect 
 our operations, cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters . 
 There are different labor unions represented across our sites and a majority of our employees are covered by a collective labor 
 agreement as a result of either local or national negotiations in the countries concerned. Labor disputes or other problems, such as 
 work stoppages, or failure to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of the collective labor agreements, could lead to a substantial 
 interruption to our business. 
 In addition, our business relies on vendors, suppliers and other third parties that have union employees. Any of the matters described 
 above, including work stoppages or other labor relations matters affecting us or these vendors, suppliers and other third parties, as well 
 as future developments in relation to our business or otherwise that adversely affect relations between us and our employees, could 
 adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 We operate in a challenging market for talent and may not be able to attract, motivate and/or retain qualified personnel, including our 
 key personnel . 
 Our success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the 
 continuously developing needs of our customers. The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to 
 attract, motivate and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience. 
 Changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as more tenured and 
 experienced workers retire. If we are unable to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience excessive 
 turnover, including among hourly workers, we may experience declining sales, manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies, 
 increased recruiting, training and relocation costs and other difficulties, and our results of operations, cash flows and financial 
 condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares may be adversely impacted. 

72 

The market for both hourly workers and professional workers has remained challenging in fiscal 2024, particularly in the U.S. The 
 market and labor environment for hourly workers is increasingly competitive and facing higher levels of labor unrest than has 
 historically been experienced. In certain locations where we operate, the demand for labor continues to exceed the supply of labor, 
 resulting in higher costs. Despite our focused efforts to attract, motivate and retain employees, we continue to focus on the 
 stabilization of attrition rates within our workforce. We also incurred higher operating costs at certain of our facilities in the form of 
 higher levels of overtime pay due to shift requirements and staffing challenges. 
 In addition, many professional workers desire a fully remote work setting. We offer flexible working arrangements in the majority of 
 instances; however, we may experience higher levels of attrition within our professional workforce if these workers desire more 
 remote work opportunities than we are able to offer. We may also experience higher levels of attrition if employees do not perceive 
 the purpose and impact of their work to be rewarding or their work-life balance to be satisfactory. 
 We also rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively. The loss of these 
 employees, combined with a challenging market for attracting and retaining employees, could adversely affect our results of 
 operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares may also be adversely impacted. The recent 
 Combination of may exacerbate each of these challenges. 
 We face challenges associated with sustainability matters, including climate change and scarce resources, which could have a 
 significant impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary 
 shares . 
 We have identified multiple ways in which climate change could impact our business operations, including through extreme weather 
 patterns. Our physical assets and infrastructure, including our manufacturing operations, are subject to risks from volatile and 
 damaging weather patterns. For example, severe weather-related events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, other extreme storms, 
 wildfires, and floods, have resulted in and/or could in future periods result in lost production and/or physical damage to our facilities. 
 Unpredictable weather patterns or extended periods of severe weather may also result in supply chain disruptions and increased 
 material costs. In addition, one of our key raw materials is virgin wood fiber, the availability of which is dependent on the 
 maintenance of healthy forests, which could be impacted by adverse weather conditions, including drought, flooding and local 
 restrictions on water usage. Moreover, the ability to harvest the virgin fiber used in our manufacturing operations may be limited, and 
 prices for this raw material may fluctuate, during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought or during tree disease or insect epidemics 
 or other environmental conditions that may be caused by variations in climate conditions. Other climate-related business risks that we 
 face include risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as increased prices for certain fuels, including natural gas; 
 the introduction of a carbon tax or government mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and more stringent and/or complex 
 environmental and other legal requirements. To the extent that severe weather or other climate-related risks materialize, and we are 
 unprepared for them, we may incur unexpected costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial 
 condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 The paper manufacturing industry in which we operate is energy intensive, and government initiatives, such as the European Union 
 Green Deal, the European Union s initiative to reach net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, could increase government 
 regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, putting further limits on our paper manufacturing operations. In addition, efforts aimed at 
 transitioning to a lower carbon economy may result in a transition towards the use of materials that are more suitable for reusable 
 packaging such as glass, metal or plastic. As such, demand for paper packaging may decline, while demand for alternative packaging 
 types may increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of 
 our ordinary shares. 

73 

Increased focus and activism related to sustainability matters may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital 
 investment as a result of their assessment of our sustainability practices. Customers, investors, regulators and other stakeholders are 
 increasingly focusing on various sustainability issues, including those with respect to climate change, circular economy, packaging 
 waste, sustainable supply chain practices, deforestation, biodiversity, land, energy and water use, diversity, equity, inclusion and 
 belonging and other human capital matters. This increased awareness may result in more prescriptive reporting requirements with 
 respect to these topics, an increased expectation that such topics will be voluntarily disclosed by companies such as ours, and 
 increased pressure to make commitments, set targets and take action to meet them. Concern over climate change or the use and 
 composition of packaging materials may also result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate 
 impacts to the environment. These demands, regulatory requirements, and related perceptions and preferences could cause us to incur 
 additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with such, demands, requirements and customer preferences, and a 
 delay in our response (or the failure to respond effectively) may lead to material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, 
 financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. See also We are subject to a growing number of environmental laws 
 and regulations, and the cost of compliance or the failure to comply with, and any liabilities under, current and future laws and 
 regulations may negatively affect our business. Further, there can be no assurance that environmental activist groups and similar 
 organizations will not mount campaigns against us. 
 Both legacy Smurfit Kappa and WestRock established and publicly disclosed sustainability targets which are important to many 
 stakeholders, including certain investors and customers. Similarly, Smurfit Westrock may develop and publish new consolidated 
 group targets. We expect to report performance relative to any such targets on an annual basis. Failure to meet any such targets could 
 result in negative publicity and reputational damage and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of 
 operations, financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. If any such targets or commitments are not achieved on 
 their projected timelines or at all, or if they are perceived negatively, including the perception that they are not sufficiently robust or, 
 conversely, are too costly, this would impact our reputation as well as our relationships with investors, customers and other 
 stakeholders. Moreover, any failure to act responsibly with respect to sustainability issues or to effectively respond to new, or changes 
 in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other sustainability matters, or increased operating or manufacturing 
 costs due to increased regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results, financial condition 
 and the trading price of our ordinary shares. In addition, we may also be adversely impacted as a result of conduct by contractors, 
 customers or suppliers that fail to meet our or our stakeholders sustainability standards. 
 Any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our 
 ordinary shares. 
 Failure by us to successfully implement strategic transformation initiatives, including those relating to information technology 
 infrastructure, could adversely affect our business . 
 Smurfit Kappa and WestRock have throughout the years undertaken various projects relating to information technology infrastructure. 
 As part of integration initiatives, the Company is reviewing and evaluating its various business systems and the system strategies and 
 alternatives for Smurfit Westrock. The implementation of changes in business systems could represent a significant financial 
 undertaking and may require substantial time and attention of management and key employees. We may not be able to successfully 
 implement these initiatives without delays or may experience unanticipated business disruptions and/or we may not achieve the 
 desired benefits from such changes. Project completion dates may also change. Any of these items, along with any failure to 
 effectively manage data governance risks during implementation of these initiatives, could adversely affect our results of operations, 
 cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 If we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions or if disposals result in unexpected costs or liabilities, our business could be 
 materially and adversely affected . 
 We have completed a number of mergers, acquisitions, investments and divestitures in the past, including the recent Combination, and 
 we may seek to acquire, invest in, sell or enter into transactions with additional companies in the future. See also the risks discussed 
 under Risks Related to the Combination described below. 
 We may not be able to identify suitable targets or purchasers or successfully complete suitable transactions in the future, and future 
 completed transactions may not be successful. 

74 

These transactions create risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with: 
 disrupting our ongoing business, including greater than expected costs and management time and effort involved in 
 identifying and completing the transactions and integrating acquisitions; 
 integrating acquired businesses and personnel into our business, including integrating personnel, information technology 
 systems and operations across different cultures and languages, and addressing the operational risks associated with these 
 integration activities as well as the economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; 
 working with partners or other ownership structures with shared decision-making authority; 
 obtaining and verifying relevant information regarding a business prior to the consummation of the transaction, including the 
 identification and assessment of liabilities, claims or other circumstances that could result in litigation or regulatory risk 
 exposure; 
 obtaining required regulatory approvals and/or financing on favorable terms; 
 retaining key employees, contractual relationships or customers; 
 the potential impairment of assets and goodwill; 
 the additional operating losses and expenses of businesses we acquire or in which we invest; 
 incurring substantial indebtedness to finance an acquisition or investment; 
 incurring unexpected costs or liabilities in the context of a disposal; and 
 implementing controls, procedures and policies in acquired companies. 
 These transactions may not be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and 
 the trading price of our ordinary shares. Among the benefits we expect from potential, as well as completed, acquisitions and joint 
 ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of 
 divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers that place higher strategic value on these 
 businesses and assets than we do. For acquisitions, our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of realizing them depend on 
 the successful integration of the acquired businesses and operations with our business and operations. Even if we integrate these 
 businesses and operations successfully, we may not realize the full benefits we expected within the anticipated time frame, or at all, 
 and the benefits may be offset by unanticipated costs or delays. 
 Risks Related to the Combination 
 We may not realize all of the benefits of the recent Combination or such benefits may take longer than anticipated or may be lower than 
 estimated . 
 We are targeting annual pre-tax run-rate synergies of 400 million by the end of the first full year following the recently 
 completed combination between Smurfit Kappa and WestRock, owing to integration benefits, procurement leverage and 
 administrative and overhead rationalization. In addition, we expect to achieve the anticipated benefits and run- rate synergies 
 without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. Furthermore, as we implement commercial 
 practices and improve our operating efficiency through the combination we expect to deliver at least an additional 400m. However, 
 if we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of Smurfit Kappa and WestRock in an efficient and effective manner, 
 the anticipated benefits, and run-rate synergies of the Combination may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize 
 or the costs of achieving the benefits and run-rate synergies may be more than expected. Any such risks may result in our 
 operating costs being greater than anticipated and may reduce the net benefits of the Combination. In addition, there may be some 
 negative impacts on our business as a result of the Combination, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows 
 and financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 

75 

We may fail to successfully integrate Smurfit Kappa and WestRock, including their individual cultures and philosophies . 
 Historically, Smurfit Kappa and WestRock operated as independent companies. There can be no assurance that the two businesses 
 will continue to be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Smurfit Kappa 
 or WestRock employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of either or both companies ongoing businesses, unexpected 
 integration issues, higher than expected integration costs or an overall integration process that takes longer than originally 
 anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in integrating the operations of Smurfit Kappa 
 and WestRock in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Combination: 
 combining the businesses of Smurfit Kappa and WestRock and meeting our capital requirements in a manner that permits us 
 to achieve the run-rate synergies expected to result from the Combination, the failure of which would result in the anticipated 
 benefits of the Combination not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all; 
 combining the companies operations and corporate functions; 
 integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to customers; 
 identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets; 
 reaching the potential from cross-selling corrugated and consumer-packaging products; 
 harmonizing the companies operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and 
 other policies, procedures and processes; 
 maintaining existing agreements with customers and suppliers and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with 
 prospective customers and suppliers; 
 addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies; 
 consolidating the companies administrative and information technology infrastructures; 
 coordinating distribution and marketing efforts; 
 managing the movement of certain positions to different locations; 
 coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and 
 effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approva ls. 
 In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management teams and their resources will be focused on the 
 integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our 
 business , and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary 
 shares . 
 We have incurred and will incur significant costs as a result of becoming subject to U.S. regulations and reporting requirements, 
 which will place significant demands on our management team, financial controls and reporting systems, and will require a substantial 
 amount of management time. This may materially adversely affect our operating results . 
 There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in 
 connection with the Combination and significant demands will be placed on our managerial, operational and financial personnel 
 and systems. Our future operating results may be affected by the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing 
 business conditions and to implement, expand and revise our operational and financial controls and reporting systems in response 
 to the Combination. For example, while WestRock prepared its financial statements in accordance with GAAP, Smurfit Kappa 
 has historically prepared its financial statements in accordance with IFRS EU. The revisions required to consolidate the financial 
 reporting system of the combined company and to switch the reporting system from IFRS EU to GAAP has placed demands on 
 our financial controls and reporting systems and may continue to place such demands in the future. 
 Furthermore, we are required to comply with securities laws and other laws and regulations applicable in the U.S., the U.K. and 
 Ireland. It is expected that the applicable rules and regulations will result in considerable legal and financial compliance costs, 
 and the cost of compliance or the failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations, 
 cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 

76 

We will be required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and may incur significant costs and devote substantial management time 
 towards developing and maintaining adequate internal controls, which may materially adversely affect our operating results in the 
 future. 
 In addition to complying with securities laws and other laws and regulations applicable in the U.S., the U.K. and Ireland, we are 
 required to comply with the application of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as revise our internal control systems pursuant to U.S. 
 regulations, all of which is expected to result in considerable legal and financial compliance costs. 
 Our management is responsible for establishing, maintaining and reporting on the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
 and disclosure controls and procedures to comply with applicable requirements, including the reporting requirements of the Sarbanes- 
 Oxley Act. These internal controls must be designed by management to achieve the objective of providing reasonable assurance 
 regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes and in accordance with 
 GAAP. We will continue to develop and refine our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. 
 However, we have not yet assessed our internal controls over financial reporting for the purposes of complying with Section 404 of 
 the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will only be required to do so beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. Material 
 weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. If we are not able to comply with the 
 requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our accounting firm further identifies deficiencies in our internal control 
 over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline and we could 
 be subject to lawsuits, sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management 
 resources. See also We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not 
 remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial 
 obligations. 
 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in 
 material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations. 
 As more fully disclosed in Item 4, Controls and Procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, 
 including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design 
 and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, we 
 have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to a material weakness in 
 our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in our internal 
 control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or 
 interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 This material weakness relates to the company s selection and development of control activities intended to mitigate the risks to 
 achieving its objectives and involves processes and controls principally at historical Smurfit Kappa that were not previously subject to 
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This material weakness resulted in: (i) a lack of formalization of an existing control process 
 for documenting evidence of management review and performance of control procedures, including the level of precision in the 
 execution of controls and procedures to ascertain completeness and accuracy of information produced by the Company, (ii) existing 
 controls related to the preparation and review of manual journal entries not designed to adequately mitigate the associated risks, and 
 (iii) the need to augment general IT controls, specifically as they pertain to (a) logical access controls to ensure appropriate 
 segregation of duties and that adequately restrict access to financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate Company 
 personnel and (b) program change management controls to ensure that information technology program and data changes affecting 
 financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately. While 
 these deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement of our financial statements, there is a reasonable possibility that these 
 deficiencies could have resulted in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented 
 or detected on a timely basis. 

77 

We have begun the process of designing and implementing remediation measures in respect of this material weakness and to improve 
 our internal control over financial reporting. However, we can give no assurance that the measures we take will remediate the material 
 weakness or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Any failure to remediate the material w eakness , or the 
 development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our 
 financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations or fail to prevent fraud, which may cause 
 investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and subject us to potential delisting from the New York Stock 
 Exchange NYSE and/or the London Stock Exchange LSE ), regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions, any or all 
 of which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary 
 shares. 
 Changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of 
 operations, financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares . 
 Changes in existing accounting rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements or rules or varying interpretations of current 
 accounting pronouncements could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations, financial conditions and the 
 trading price of our ordinary shares, or the manner in which we conducts our business. Further, such changes could potentially affect 
 our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective. 
 GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate 
 and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on 
 our business, results of operations, financial conditions and the trading price of our ordinary shares, and could affect the reporting of 
 transactions completed before the announcement of a change. 
 Financial Risks 
 Our continued growth depends on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers . 
 The future growth of our business depends on our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers as well as getting existing 
 customers and new customers to increase their volume commitments. There is no assurance that customers will continue to use our 
 services or that we will be able to continue to attract new volumes at the same rate as we have in the past. 
 A customer s use of our services may decrease for a variety of reasons, including the customer s level of satisfaction with our products 
 and services, the expansion of business to offer new products and services, the effectiveness of our support services, the pricing of our 
 products and services, the pricing, range and quality of competing products or services, the effects of global economic conditions, 
 regulatory limitations, trust, perception and interest in the paper and packaging industry and in our products and services. Furthermore, 
 the complexity and costs associated with switching to a competitor may not be significant enough to prevent a customer from 
 switching packaging providers. 
 Any failure by us to retain existing customers, attract new customers, and increase revenue from both new and existing customers 
 could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary 
 shares. These efforts may require substantial financial expenditures, commitments of resources, developments of processes, and other 
 investments and innovations. 
 A number of the industries in which our customers operate have experienced consolidation in the past and may continue to do so in the 
 future. Such consolidation may affect our relations with our customers. In the past, when one of our customers has combined with 
 another, we have on occasion lost business and there can be no assurance that this will not occur again in the future. Additionally, the 
 ability of customers to exert pricing pressure on all suppliers, including us, has increased as their industries have consolidated and the 
 customers have become larger. However, our level of customer concentration may increase in the future. Such consolidation could 
 have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 

78 

Our debt could adversely affect our financial health. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total debt was 13.9 billion. Our levels of debt could restrict our operations and make it more difficult 
 for us to satisfy our debt obligations, the implications of which could include but are not limited to: 
 requiring us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund repayments on our debt, 
 thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate 
 purposes; 
 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry or competitive conditions; 
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate; 
 limiting our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future; 
 restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; and 
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. 
 Any of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our 
 ordinary shares. To the extent that we incur additional debt or such other obligations, the risk associated with our debt described above 
 may increase. 
 In addition, a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. Our exposure to rising 
 interest rates subjects us to increased debt service obligations, both with respect to existing floating rate indebtedness and the 
 incurrence of additional fixed or floating indebtedness during periods where such rates are in effect. Although we may hedge a portion 
 of our exposure to variable interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps from time to time, we cannot provide assurances that we 
 will do so in the future. An increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense on our variable rate debt obligations, 
 which may exacerbate the risks associated with our capital structure and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and 
 financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. Restrictions imposed by certain of our existing and future indentures 
 and credit facilities limit or may limit our ability to take certain actions. 
 Adverse credit and financial market events and conditions, as well as credit rating downgrades, could, among other things, impede 
 access to or increase the cost of financing, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, 
 financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares . 
 We rely on access to the credit and capital markets to finance our operations and refinance existing indebtedness. Any limitations on 
 our access to the credit and capital markets on satisfactory terms, or at all, could limit our liquidity, financial flexibility or cash flows 
 and affect our ability to execute our strategic plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, 
 financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 Our access to the credit and capital markets is subject to a number of variables, including our results of operations, margins and 
 activity levels, the conditions of the global credit and capital markets, market perceptions of our creditworthiness and the ability and 
 willingness of lenders and investors to provide capital. In recent years, global financial markets have experienced disruptions and 
 general economic conditions have been volatile. During periods of financial market volatility, our access to the credit and capital 
 markets could be impaired, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the trading 
 price of our ordinary shares. 
 In addition, the costs and availability of financing from the credit and capital markets depends on our credit ratings. Any rating, 
 outlook or watch assigned to such debt securities could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating 
 agency s judgement, current or future circumstances change relating to the basis of the rating, outlook or watch, such as adverse 
 changes to the C ompany s business. Any failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings could adversely affect our future 
 cost of funding, liquidity or access to capital markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and 
 financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares . 

79 

We have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a write-down could materially adversely impact our 
 operating results . 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had goodwill and other intangible assets in an amount of 8,309 million. In accordance with GAAP, we 
 do not amortize goodwill but rather test it annually and as otherwise required for impairment and any such impairments cannot be 
 reversed. Similarly, we review our other intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
 be recoverable. The impairment analysis requires us to analyze a number of factors and make estimates that require significant 
 judgment. In the event that general trading conditions and prospects deteriorate or factors underlying assumed discount rates, such as 
 assumed long-term interest rates, change, the determined recoverable amount of certain non-current assets may fall below carrying 
 value. We have recorded impairments in previous years. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, WestRock determined that 
 its Global Paper and Corrugated Packaging reporting units had carrying values that exceeded their fair values, and it recorded an 
 aggregate pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of 1.9 billion. Additional impairments may occur in the future, which could adversely 
 affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 We have a number of pension arrangements that are currently in deficit and may require increased funding due to statutory 
 requirements, and we may also incur additional liability and/or increased funding requirements in connection with our multi- 
 employer pension funds . 
 We operate a number of pension and other long-term benefit plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with local conditions 
 and practice. Currently, a significant but declining proportion of our employees are members of defined benefit pension arrangements, 
 most of which are now closed to new entrants and future benefit accrual. The deficit of these employee benefit plans was 228.0 
 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 An increase in the value of the liabilities or decrease in the value of pension plan assets may negatively affect our balance sheet and 
 distributable reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and 
 the trading price of our ordinary shares. The liabilities will mainly be affected by increases in life expectancy and by changes in long- 
 term yields, which are used to discount the liabilities to present value. The assets will be affected by increases in long-term yields, 
 which will reduce the value of bond investments, and by movements in equity markets. These factors create a considerable degree of 
 volatility in the measurement of any pension scheme s deficit or surplus. 
 There is a risk that equity and bond markets will deteriorate if the global economic climate worsens, which could negatively affect the 
 funded status of our post-employment defined benefit arrangements. In addition, volatility in our net balance sheet liabilities resulting 
 from the relative change in the value of assets and liabilities may be further enhanced by investment strategies resulting in exposure to 
 various classes of assets. 
 Existing and potential changes in statutory minimum requirements may also affect the amount and timing of funding to be paid by us. 
 Most funding requirements consider yields on assets such as government bonds or interbank interest rate swap curves, depending on 
 the basis. Although recent statutory easements in the pace of funding on these bases and increases in bond/swap yields have provided 
 some contribution relief to us, we may nonetheless have to pay additional contributions to meet potentially onerous statutory minimum 
 funding requirements in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial 
 condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 

80 

In addition, we believe that certain of the Multi-Employer Pension Plans MEPPs in which we participate or have participated, 
 including the Pace Industry Union-Management Pension Fund PIUMPF ), have material unfunded vested benefits. We submitted 
 formal notification to withdraw from MEPPs in the past and have recorded withdrawal liabilities, including an estimate of our portion 
 of PIUMPF s accumulated funding deficiency. We may withdraw from other MEPPs in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we had 
 recorded 212 million of withdrawal liabilities, including liabilities associated with PIUMPF s accumulated funding deficiency 
 demands. In July 2021, PIUMPF filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia claiming the right 
 to recover our pro rata share of the pension fund s accumulated funding deficiency, along with interest, liquidated damages and 
 attorney s fees. The impact of increased contributions, future funding obligations or future withdrawal liabilities may adversely affect 
 our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 Any dividend payment in respect of our shares is subject to a number of factors, including the distributions of earnings to the 
 Company by its subsidiaries, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company, as well as the distributable reserves 
 of the Company and the discretion of the Company s board, and there are no guarantees that the Company will pay dividends or 
 the level of any such dividends. 
 Any determination to pay dividends to our shareholders will be at the discretion of the Company s board and will be dependent on 
 then-existing conditions, including but not limited to, our results of operations, capital investment priorities, the market price of our 
 shares and access to capital markets, legal requirements, industry practice, the distribution of earnings to the Company by its 
 subsidiaries, the financial condition, limitations under Irish law and other factors the Company deems relevant. While Smurfit Kappa 
 and WestRock each has historically paid dividends, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will receive or be entitled to 
 dividends that are equivalent to the historical dividends of Smurfit Kappa or WestRock, and there is no assurance as to the timing or 
 level of future dividend payments, if any, because these depend on, among other considerations, future earnings, capital requirements 
 and financial condition, legal requirements, covenant compliance, restrictions in our existing and any future debt agreements and other 
 factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other requirements that may change or may impose substantial 
 compliance costs, and non-compliance with such laws and regulations may negatively affect our business . 
 We are subject to a wide variety of regional, national provincial, and local laws, regulations and other requirements, including those 
 relating to the environment, product safety, competition, corruption, sanctions, occupational health and safety, labor and employment, 
 data privacy, tax and health care. These laws, regulations and other requirements may change or be applied or interpreted in ways that 
 will require us to modify our equipment and/or operations, subject us to enforcement risk, expose us to reputational harm or require us 
 to incur additional costs, including substantial compliance costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and 
 financial condition, and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 We operate in multiple countries, and each of these countries may have bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the 
 US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , the Sapin II Law in France, the Bribery Act in the United Kingdom and the Criminal Justice 
 (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 in Ireland, some of which are potentially extra-territorial in scope. Our internal control policies and 
 procedures, or those of our vendors, may not adequately protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed or alleged to have been 
 committed by our employees, agents or vendors. Any such non-compliance with bribery and anti-corruption legislation could lead to 
 civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and/or could damage reputations. 
 In addition, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions in which we operate could change in the future. There may be an enactment 
 of additional, or the revision of existing, state, federal and/or non-U.S. laws, and/or a development of case law, regulations and policy 
 changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate. 

81 

Moreover, we are subject to regulation by trade sanctions and related legislation, which have become an increasingly prevalent 
 instrument of foreign policy in recent years. Sanctions lists are generated by a wide variety of government agencies in countries where 
 we do business, and the individuals, entities and products on these lists are being modified with increasing frequency in recent years. 
 Due to our scale and footprint, we must monitor existing sanctions closely and exercise caution to avoid trading with any sanctioned 
 country, individual or organization. The penalties for non-compliance with sanctions regimes are severe; offenses for breach of 
 sanctions regimes can be both civil and criminal in nature. We could therefore be adversely affected by sanctions if we fail to closely 
 monitor compliance with sanctions regimes, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition 
 and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 In addition, future compliance with existing and new laws and requirements has the potential to disrupt our business operations and 
 may require significant expenditures, and our existing reserves for specific matters may not be adequate to cover future costs. In 
 particular, our manufacturing operations consume significant amounts of energy, and we may in the future incur additional or 
 increased capital, operating and other expenditures from changes due to new or increased climate-related and other environmental 
 requirements. We could also incur substantial liabilities, including fines or sanctions, enforcement actions, natural resource damages 
 claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury under environmental and other laws. 
 We believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under certain purchase and other 
 agreements in connection with certain remediation sites. We have insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles or retentions, 
 policy limits and other conditions, for certain environmental matters; however, we may not be successful with respect to any claim 
 regarding these insurance or indemnification rights and, if we are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or 
 indemnification rights may not be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses. 
 We are subject to a growing number of environmental laws and regulations, and the cost of compliance or the failure to comply 
 with, and any liabilities under, current and future laws and regulations may negatively affect our business . 
 Environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business. Our manufacturing processes involve the use 
 of natural resources, such as virgin wood fiber and fresh water, discharges to water, air emissions and waste handling and disposal 
 activities. These processes are subject to numerous regional, national and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as the 
 requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by various government authorities. Complex and lengthy 
 processes may be required to obtain and renew approvals, permits, and licenses for new, existing or modified facilities. Additionally, 
 the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials require release prevention plans and emergency protocols. We have 
 incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable 
 environmental laws and regulations. Changes in environmental laws, as well as litigation relating to these laws, could result in more 
 stringent or additional environmental compliance obligations for the Company that may require additional capital investments or 
 increase our operating costs. 
 We are involved in various administrative and other proceedings relating to environmental matters that arise in the normal course of 
 business, and we may become involved in similar matters in the future. Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be 
 predicted and we cannot at this time estimate any reasonably possible losses based on available information, we do not believe that the 
 currently expected outcome of any environmental proceedings and claims that are pending or threatened against us will have a 
 material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 We also may incur significant expenditures in connection with the required remediation of environmental conditions at both currently 
 owned and formerly owned facilities, as well as in connection with various sites owned or operated by third parties. While we believe 
 that we can assert claims for indemnification of remediation expenses pursuant to rights we have under certain agreements in respect 
 of certain remediation sites and we have insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles or retentions, policy limits and other 
 conditions, for certain environmental matters, we may not be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or 
 indemnification rights and, if we are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights may not be 
 sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses. We also cannot predict whether we will be required to perform remediation projects at 
 other locations, and it is possible that our remediation requirements and costs could increase materially in the future and exceed 
 current reserves. In addition, we cannot currently determine the impact that future changes in cleanup standards or regional, national, 
 local or other environmental laws, regulations or enforcement practices will have on our results of operations, financial condition or 
 cash flows. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and the 
 trading price of our ordinary shares. 

82 

We are subject to compliance with antitrust and similar legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate . 
 We are subject to legislation in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate relating to unfair competitive practices and similar 
 behavior. From time to time, we have been subject to allegations of such practices and regulatory investigations or proceedings with 
 respect thereto. Such allegations, investigations or proceedings (irrespective of merit) may require us to devote significant 
 management resources to defending ourselves. In the event that such allegations are proven, we may be subject to fines, damages 
 awards and other expenses, and our reputation may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of 
 operations, financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. 
 For instance, in August 2019, the Italian Competition Authority (the AGCM notified approximately 30 companies, of which 
 Smurfit Kappa Italia S.p.A. Smurfit Kappa Italia was one, that an investigation had found the companies to have engaged in anti- 
 competitive practices. After publication of the AGCM s August 2019 decision, a number of purchasers of corrugated sheets and 
 boxes initiated litigation proceedings against our companies, alleging that they were harmed by the alleged anti-competitive practices 
 and seeking damages. These actions are still in early stages, and Smurfit Westrock cannot predict its potential liability or their 
 outcomes with certainty at this point in time. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that additional legal actions arising out of or relating to 
 the AGCM s decision will not be brought against us in the future. See Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to 
 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information . 
 We are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to privacy, security and data protection, and failure to comply with 
 such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and our financial condition or lead to fines and/or litigation . 
 We are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to privacy, security and data protection, including the General Data 
 Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) GDPR and new and evolving privacy laws in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and 
 elsewhere. These laws and regulations have created new individual privacy rights, imposed increased obligations on companies 
 handling personal data, and increased potential exposure to fines and penalties as a result of breaches of such privacy, security or data 
 protection laws. Additionally, new laws or regulations governing privacy, security and data protection may be introduced which apply 
 to us in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The nature and extent of any such new and/or amended laws or regulations, and 
 the impact they may have on us, cannot be predicted. 
 We rely on third-party service providers and our own employees and systems to collect and process personal data and to maintain our 
 databases, and as a result, we are exposed to the risk that such data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, or damaged or 
 processed in breach of such privacy, security or data protection laws. These events could result in disruptions and damage, or the 
 misappropriation of sensitive data, and depending on their nature and scope, could lead to the compromise of confidential information, 
 improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes, 
 operational disruptions and exposure to liability. Such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions, including 
 reputational damage and legal claims or proceedings, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash 
 flows, financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. See also We are subject to cybersecurity risks that could 
 threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data in our systems, and could result in disruptions to our operations and 
 adversely affect our operations, cash flows and financial condition . 
 While we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy, security and data protection, it is possible 
 that such requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict 
 with other laws or our practices. That concern is particularly relevant for the GDPR, as different EU member state regulators may 
 differ as to their interpretation of the GDPR and the approach they may take to breaches, enforcement, complaints or the exercise of 
 rights to access personal data by individuals. Any perceived or actual failure by us to protect confidential data, personal data, any 
 material non-compliance with privacy, security or data protection laws or regulations or any general IT system failure may harm our 
 reputation and credibility, adversely affect our revenues, reduce our ability to attract or retain customers, result in litigation or other 
 actions being brought against us and the imposition of significant fines and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our 
 business, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares.

Failure to comply with applicable occupational health and safety laws and regulations or maintain good health and safety and 
 employee well-being practices in our facilities may have a material adverse effect on our business . 
 We are subject to a broad range of regional, national, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to occupational health and 
 safety, and our safety program includes measures required for compliance. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, operating 
 costs and capital expenditures to meet our health and safety obligations, as well as to continually improve our safety systems. 
 In addition, our business involves the use of heavy equipment, machinery and chemicals and requires the performance of activities that 
 create safety exposures, including the performance of relatively difficult and specialized tasks. Safeguarding the health, safety and 
 overall wellbeing of our colleagues is a top concern and critical to attracting and retaining the best talent and also plays a pivotal role 
 in realizing our business and sustainability objectives. We implement our health and safety requirements through a safety management 
 system that includes best practice sharing and operational learning and seek to reduce exposures and eliminate serious injuries and 
 fatalities through engagement, execution of targeted risk reduction measures, and implementation of systems that promote continuous 
 improvement. Despite such efforts, a serious incident affecting the health and safety of any of our employees could occur and disrupt 
 our operations. There is also a risk of significant fines and penalties or litigation if a health and safety incident occurs. Furthermore, 
 disruption of operations caused by a major incident could have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships, business, 
 results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our ordinary shares. Additionally, portions of our operations are in 
 areas with ongoing political or geopolitical uncertainty which could pose security risks to our employees or operations. See also As a 
 leading global manufacturing business, we have been, and may be in the future, adversely affected by factors that are beyond our 
 control, such as economic and financial market conditions, geopolitical conflicts and other social and political unrest or change and 
 We are exposed to risks related to our international sales and operations . 
 The Company s maintenance of two exchange listings may adversely affect liquidity in the market for our shares and result in 
 pricing differentials of our shares between the two exchanges. 
 Given trading in our shares on the NYSE and the LSE takes place in different currencies (U.S. dollars on the NYSE and sterling on the 
 LSE) and at different times (resulting from different time zones, different trading hours and different trading days for the NYSE and 
 the LSE), the trading prices of our shares on these two exchanges may at times differ due to these and other factors. Any decrease in 
 the price of our shares on the NYSE could cause a decrease in the trading price of our shares on the LSE and vice versa. 
 Risks Related to Our Incorporation in Ireland 
 We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and might afford less protection to our 
 shareholders. 
 As an Irish company, we are governed by the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland, as amended (the Companies Act ). The Companies Act 
 differs in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders under various 
 state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder 
 lawsuits and indemnification of directors. 
 Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S., and our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than 
 would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S. The U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland 
 providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, there is some 
 uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our 
 directors or officers based on U.S. federal or state civil liability laws, including the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state 
 securities laws, or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. 
 Under Irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish 
 companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under Irish law and may only do so 
 in limited circumstances. Directors of an Irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care 
 and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company. Directors have a duty not to put themselves in a 
 position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any 
 personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director or officer of an Irish company 
 is found to have breached his or her duties to that company, he or she could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that 
 breach of duty. 

84 

In addition, under Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the 
 company s authorized but unissued share capital. In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company 
 issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing 
 shareholders on a pro-rata basis. If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the 
 terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding 
 acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected. 
 Any attempts to acquire the Company will be subject to the Irish Takeover Rules and subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the 
 Irish Takeover Panel and the Company s board may be limited by the Irish Takeover Rules in its ability to defend an unsolicited 
 takeover attempt. 
 The Company is subject to the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997, Takeover Rules, 2022 (the Irish Takeover Rules ), which regulate the 
 conduct of takeovers of, and certain other relevant transactions affecting, Irish public limited companies listed on certain stock 
 exchanges, including the NYSE and the LSE. The Irish Takeover Rules are administered by the Irish Takeover Panel, which has 
 supervisory jurisdiction over such transactions. Among other matters, the Irish Takeover Rules operate to ensure that no offer is 
 frustrated or unfairly prejudiced and, in situations involving multiple bidders, that there is a level playing field. 
 The Company is subject to the Irish Takeover Rules, under which we are not permitted to take certain actions that might frustrate an 
 offer for our ordinary shares once we receive an offer, or have reason to believe an offer is or may be imminent, without the approval 
 of more than 50 of our shareholders entitled to vote at a general meeting of the Company s shareholders or the consent of the Irish 
 Takeover Panel. This may limit the ability of the Company s board to take defensive actions even if it believes that such defensive 
 actions would be in the Company s best interests or the best interests of our shareholders.

 5. PLAN LIMITS 
 
 5.1 The Board must not grant an Award which would, on the day before the Grant Date, cause the number of Shares allocated under the Plan and under any other employee share plan adopted by the Company, to exceed such number as represents ten per cent of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue at that time. 
 
 5.2 The Board must not grant an Award which would, on the day before the Grant Date, cause the number of Shares allocated under the Plan and under any other discretionary employee share plan adopted by the Company, to exceed such number as represents five per cent of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue at that time. 
 
 5.3 Subject to rules 5.4 and 5.5, in determining the limits set out in rules 5.1 and 5.2, Shares are treated as allocated if, on any day, they have been newly issued by the Company or transferred from treasury to satisfy an option, award or other right granted during the previous ten years prior to that day (an award ), or in the case of such an award in respect of which Shares are yet to be delivered, if the Board intends that new Shares will be issued or that Shares from treasury will be transferred and for these purposes the number of Shares allocated includes 
 
 5.3.1 Shares which have been issued or may be issued to any Trustee 
 
 5.3.2 Shares which have been or may be transferred from treasury to any Trustee and 
 
 in either case for the Trustee to then transfer to satisfy an award (unless these Shares have already been counted under this rule). 
 5.4 The Board may determine that Shares transferred from treasury will cease to count as allocated for the purposes of rule 5.3 if guidelines published by institutional investor representative bodies no longer require such Shares to be counted. 
 
 5.5 The number of Shares allocated does not include 
 
 5.5.1 Shares issued or committed to be issued to satisfy awards granted prior to the admission of the Shares to trading on any stock exchange 
 
 5.5.2 Shares that were allocated to satisfy awards to the extent that such awards have lapsed or been relinquished

 4 

5.7 The Board may make such adjustments to the method of assessing the limits set out in rules 5.1 and 5.2 as it considers appropriate in the event of any variation of the Company s share capital. 
 6. REDUCTION FOR MALUS CLAWBACK 
 
 6.1 Notwithstanding any other rule of the Plan, this rule 6 applies to each Award and will continue to apply after the cessation of a Participant s office or employment with a Group Member for any reason, whether or not any termination is unlawful. 
 
 6.2 If any of the circumstances, referred to in rule 6.3 arise the Board may, in its discretion, determine at any time prior to the Normal Vesting Date to

 6.2.2 impose further conditions on an Award 
 
 6.2.3 where Shares or cash have been delivered to satisfy the Vesting of an Award, require a Participant to make a cash payment to the Company in respect of some or all of the Shares or cash delivered to him under the Award and or 
 
 6.2.4 where Shares or cash have been delivered to satisfy the Vesting of an Award, require a Participant to transfer for nil consideration some or all of the Shares delivered to him under the Award 
 
 and, in respect of rules 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 the Board will have the discretion to determine the basis on which the amount of cash or number of Shares is calculated including whether and if so to what extent to take account of any tax or social security or similar liability applicable to the Award. 
 
 6.3 The circumstances referred to in rule 6.2 are 
 
 6.3.1 a material misstatement of the Company s consolidated audited financial results in respect of the Financial Year over which the Bonus referred to in rule 2.3 was earned

 6.3.3 fraud or any other material financial irregularity affecting the Company, any Group Member or a relevant business unit 
 
 6.3.4 the occurrence of an event which causes or is likely to cause reputational damage to the Company, any Group Member or a relevant business unit

 6.3.6 a corporate failure in any Group Member or a relevant business unit or 
 
 6.3.7 other circumstance which the Board in its discretion considers to be similar in their nature or effect to those in rules 6.3.1, 6.3.2, 6.3.3, 6.3.4 and 6.3.5. 
 
 6.4 If the action or conduct of any Participant, Group Member or relevant business unit is under investigation by the Company, or the Company has been notified by a regulatory authority that an investigation into such action or 
 5 

conduct has been commenced prior to the Normal Vesting Date and such investigation has not been or is not expected to be concluded by that date, the Board may extend the period referred to in rule 6.2 to end on such later date as the Board considers appropriate to allow such investigation to be concluded. 
 
 6.5 The Board may decide to 
 
 6.5.1 reduce (including to zero) the number of Shares to which an Award relates 
 
 6.5.2 impose further conditions on an Award and or 
 
 6.5.3 require a Participant to transfer for nil consideration some or all of the Shares delivered to him under an Award or make a cash payment to the Company in respect of some or all of the Shares delivered to him under an Award, 
 
 to effect the recovery of sums paid or Shares delivered under any malus or clawback provisions which are included in any bonus plan or share plan (other than the Plan) operated by any Group Member and if the Board decides to apply rule 6.5.3, the Board will have the discretion to determine the basis on which the amount of cash or Shares is calculated, including whether and if so to what extent to take account of any tax or social security or similar liability applicable to the Award. 
 
 6.6 If the Board exercises its discretion in accordance with this rule 6, it will confirm this in writing to each affected Participant and, if necessary, the Trustee. 
 
 6.7 For the purposes of this rule 6, references to a Group Member or a relevant business unit include references to any former Group Member or former business unit.

 7.1 Subject to rules 10 and 11 an Award will Vest 
 
 7.1.1 on the Normal Vesting Date or 
 
 7.1.2 if on the Normal Vesting Date (or on any other date on which an Award is due to Vest under rule 10 or 11) a Dealing Restriction applies to the Award, on the date on which such Dealing Restriction lifts or 
 
 7.1.3 if the action or conduct of any Participant, Group Member or relevant business unit is under investigation pursuant to rule 6.4 and such investigation has not yet been concluded by that date, in which case an Award will Vest on such later date as the Board considers appropriate to allow such investigation to be concluded 
 
 a Nil-Cost Option may then be exercised until expiration of the Exercise Period in such manner as the Board determines, after which time it will lapse. 
 
 7.2 Subject to rules 8 and 9, where a Conditional Award has Vested or a Nil-Cost Option has been exercised, the number of Shares in respect of which the Award has Vested or been exercised together with any additional Shares or cash to which a Participant becomes entitled under rule 4 will be issued, transferred or paid (as applicable) to the Participant as soon as practicable thereafter. 
 6 

8. TAXATION AND REGULATORY ISSUES 
 
 8.1 It will be a condition of each Award that the Participant will be responsible for and indemnify each relevant Group Member and the Trustee against any Tax Liability relating to his Award. Any Group Member and or the Trustee may withhold an amount equal to such Tax Liability from any amounts due to the Participant (to the extent such withholding is lawful) and or make any other arrangements as it considers appropriate to ensure recovery of such Tax Liability including, without limitation, the sale of sufficient Shares acquired subject to the Award to realise an amount equal to the Tax Liability. 
 
 8.2 The Vesting of an Award, the exercise of a Nil-Cost Option and the issue or transfer of Shares under the Plan will be subject to obtaining any approval or consent required by the UKLA or the Irish Stock Exchange (or any other relevant authority), any Dealing Restrictions or any other applicable laws or regulations (whether in Ireland or overseas). 
 9. CASH EQUIVALENT 
 
 9.1 Subject to rule 9.2, at any time prior to the date on which an Award has Vested or, in the case of a Nil-Cost Option, has been exercised, the Board may, subject to applicable law, determine that in substitution for his right to acquire some or all of the Shares to which his Award relates, the Participant will instead receive a cash sum. The cash sum will be equal to the market value (as determined by the Board) of that number of the Shares which would otherwise have been issued or transferred and for these purposes 
 
 9.1.1 in the case of a Conditional Award, market value will be determined on the Vesting Date 
 
 9.1.2 in the case of a Nil-Cost Option, market value will be determined on the date of exercise and 
 
 in either case the cash sum will be paid to the Participant as soon as practicable after the Vesting of the Conditional Award or the exercise of the Nil-Cost Option, (or, if later, the date of the determination by the Board under this rule 9) net of any Tax Liability. 
 
 9.2 The Board may determine that this rule 9 will not apply to an Award, or any part of it. 
 10. CESSATION OF EMPLOYMENT

 10.3.5 any other reason at the Board s discretion, except where a Participant is summarily dismissed, 
 unless the Board determines that an Award will Vest in accordance with rule 10.4, an Award which has not yet Vested as at the date of cessation will continue and, subject to rule 11, Vest in full on the Normal Vesting Date. 
 10.4 If the Board determines that an Award will Vest in accordance with this rule 10.4, it will Vest in full as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of the participant s cessation of office or employment (or on such other date as determined by the Board). 
 
 10.5 A Nil-Cost Option which Vets pursuant to rules 10.2 or 10.3 may be exercised for a period of six months from the Vesting Date (or such other period as the Board may determine), after which time it will lapse, unless it lapses earlier under rule 11. 
 
 10.6 If a Participant ceases to hold office or employment with a Group Member for one of the reasons referred to in rules 10.2 or 10.3, a Nil-Cost Option which had Vested prior to the date of cessation may be exercised subject to rule 11 during the period of 
 
 10.6.1 where rule 10.2 applies, twelve months from the Participant s death and 
 
 10.6.2 where rule 10.3 applies, six months from the date of the Participant s cessation of office or employment 
 
 (or such other period as determined by the Board), after which time it will lapse. 
 10.7 For the purposes of the Plan, no person will be treated as ceasing to hold office or employment with a Group Member until that person no longer holds 
 
 10.7.1 an office or employment or 
 
 10.7.2 a right to return to work 
 
 with any Group Member.

 11.4 Other events 
 
 If the Company is or may be affected by a demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which, in the opinion of the Board, may affect the current or future value of Shares to a material extent, the Board may determine that the following provisions apply

 11.4.2 if an Award Vests under this rule 11.4, it will Vest in full and 
 
 11.4.3 to the extent that the Award does not Vest, it will lapse immediately, unless the Board determines otherwise. 
 
 The Board will then also determine the period during which any Vested Nil-Cost Option may be exercised, after which time it will lapse. 
 11.5 Exchange assumption 
 
 An Award will not Vest under rule 11.1 and a Nil-Cost Option will not lapse under 11.1, but will be exchanged or assumed on the terms set out in rule 11.6 to the extent that 
 11.5.1 an offer to exchange or assume the Award is made and accepted by a Participant

The rules of this Plan will be construed in relation to the New Award as if 
 11.6.1 the New Award was an Award granted under the Plan at the same time as the Award 
 
 11.6.2 references to the Company were references to the company whose shares are subject to the New Award and 
 
 11.6.3 references to Shares were references to shares in the company whose shares are the subject of the New Award. 
 
 11.7 Meaning of Board 
 
 Any reference to the Board in this rule 11 means the members of the Board immediately prior to the relevant event. 
 12. ADJUSTMENTS

 14. LEGAL ENTITLEMENT 
 
 14.1 This rule 14 applies during a Participant s employment with any Group Member and after the termination of such employment, whether or not the termination is lawful. 
 
 14.2 Nothing in the Plan or its operation forms part of the terms of employment of a Participant and the rights and obligations arising from a Participant s employment with any Group Member are separate from, and are not affected by, his participation in the Plan.

 terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, any rules and regulations adopted by the Committee and this letter (this 
 letter ), including the Addendum for Non-U.S. Key Employees. Any terms used in this letter and not defined in this 
 letter have the meanings set forth in the Plan. 
 This award is comprised of three components (a) a time-based stock grant, (b) a performance-based stock grant that 
 uses a cash flow per share measure, and (c) a performance-based stock grant that uses a return on invested capital 
 measure. The Stock Grant Shares that you earn pursuant to this award, if any, will comprise the aggregate amount of 
 shares awarded under each of these four components. 
 The issuance of all or any part of the Stock Grant Shares pursuant to this letter is intended to fulfill the Plan s purpose 
 of providing additional incentives to key employees such as yourself, thereby increasing your personal stake in the 
 continued success and growth of the Company and encouraging you to continue your employment with the Company. 
 1 Performance Conditions and Issuance of Stock Grant Shares 
 For the time-based stock grant, you will earn 50 of the Target Amount of shares if you satisfy the service 
 and other applicable requirements of this award. 
 For the two performance-based grants, you will have the opportunity to earn 50 of the Target Amount of 
 shares, which amount could increase up to 200 of the performance-based portion of the Target Amount of shares or 
 decrease to zero depending on the level of achievement of the performance measures discussed below. 
 Subject to Sections 3 and 5 and to any required Committee approval, the Company will register 
 (electronically or in certificated form) the appropriate number of Stock Grant Shares (minus any shares retained to 
 satisfy your statutory minimum tax withholding obligations) in your name as of VESTING DATE , at which time the 
 Stock Grant Shares will vest. The shares will be delivered to you (or, in the event of your death, in accordance with 
 Section 4) either electronically or in physical certificate as soon as practicable, free of restrictions. You may not sell,

 (subject to Committee approval), unless you have forfeited your right to such shares pursuant to Section 3 before such 
 date. The amount of Stock Grant Shares registered in your name will be based on the Company achieving the following

 ending on ENDING DATE . The Stock Grant Shares, if any, that you earn under this Section will be registered in your 
 name as of VESTING DATE (subject to Committee approval), unless you have forfeited your right to such shares

 dividend equivalents), as dividends are declared, which will be converted to additional Stock Grant 
 Shares and ultimately settled in shares of Common Stock at the same time and on the same terms as

 event of your death, disability or other termination of employment. 
 (i) Death or Disability. If your employment is terminated by reason of death or disability (as 
 determined by the Company) before VESTING DATE , you will be entitled to the number of shares that would have 
 otherwise vested had your employment not been terminated by reason of your death or disability, once such amount has 
 been determined pursuant to Section 1. Subject to the delay in distributions for certain officers under Section 11, if 
 applicable, such shares shall be issued to you (or to your Beneficiary in the case of your death) as soon as practicable

 Section 1(b), and any such shares that vest shall be issued to you on VESTING DATE . 
 (iii) Other Termination of Employment. If your employment terminates under any circumstances 
 other than the circumstances described in Section 3(a)(i), 3(a)(ii) or Section 5 before VESTING DATE , you will 
 forfeit your right to any Stock Grant Shares, including DEUs, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. 
 (iv) No Issuance. If the Percent of Target Amount as determined in accordance with Section 1 is 0, 
 then you will forfeit any interest you might have in all of the performance-based Stock Grant Shares and related DEUs

 circumstances of termination of your employment, and its determination will be final, conclusive and binding upon you.

 based Stock Grant Shares will vest at the higher of (i) 100 of the Target Amount or (ii) the average of awards of Stock 
 Grant Shares for similar awards for the last three years prior to the date of the Change in Control Termination Event, 
 plus any DEUs credited to you pursuant to Section 2(b). Subject to the delay in distribution to certain officers set forth 
 in Section 11, if applicable, such shares shall be issued to you as soon as practicable after your termination of 
 employment. 
 Change in Control Termination Event means that (i) you are terminated by the Company or its successor other 
 than for Cause or (ii) you terminate your employment with the Company or its successor for Good Reason (as defined 
 below), in either case prior to the second anniversary of the effective date of a Change in Control, provided that in the 
 case of clauses (i) and (ii) above you are employed by the Company on the date of the Change in Control. 
 Cause means solely (i) your conviction or plea of nolo contendere of a felony (ii) your disregard or failure to 
 perform the substantive elements of your responsibilities and duties as an employee of the Company or its successor 
 (iii) willful misconduct by you in the performance of your duties as an employee of the Company or its successor (iv) 
 your material violation of the Company s or its successor s Code of Conduct or other material employee policy, (v) 
 your misappropriation or embezzlement of any funds or property of the Company or its successor, commitment of fraud 
 with respect to the Company or its successor, or engagement in any act or acts of dishonesty relating to your 
 employment by the Company or its successor or (vi) through willful misconduct, personal dishonesty or gross 
 negligence, you engage in an act or course of conduct that causes substantial injury to the Company or its successor. 
 Good Reason means that, with respect to your employment at the Company or its successor, (i) your duties or 
 responsibilities are materially reduced or diminished (in the sole determination of the Company) from those that you 
 had immediately prior to the Change in Control (ii) you are transferred to a permanent work location that is greater 
 than 45 miles from your work location immediately prior to the Change in Control (iii) your annual base salary is 
 reduced below what it was immediately prior to the Change in Control (iv) a material element of your compensation is 
 eliminated or your participation in such element of compensation is materially reduced from substantially the same 
 basis as existed immediately before the Change in Control (except for across-the-board eliminations or reductions of 
 such benefits for all similarly-placed employees) (v) your participation in the same or substantially similar retirement 
 or welfare plans as existed immediately before the Change in Control is eliminated or materially reduced (except for 
 across- the-board eliminations or reductions of such benefits for all similarly-placed employees) or (vi) any other 
 material benefit of employment that you received immediately prior to the Change in Control is eliminated or materially 
 reduced (except for across-the-board eliminations or reductions of such benefits for all similarly-placed employees). 
 For the purposes of this Section 5, your employment with the Company or its successor will be deemed to include your 
 employment with any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company or its successor. 
 6. Automatic Forfeiture 
 Your right to any Stock Grant Shares and DEUs will automatically be forfeited under the following circumstances (a) 
 your employment is terminated for Cause or (b) you breach or challenge any confidentiality, non-solicitation or non- 
 competition covenant between yourself and the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate. 
 7. Federal Income Tax Consequences 
 See the prospectus made available to you in connection with this letter for a discussion of the federal income tax 
 consequences relating to the Stock Grant Shares and DEUs. You must make arrangements satisfactory to the Company 
 to satisfy any applicable federal, state, or local withholding tax liability arising from the grant or vesting of Stock Grant 
 Shares and DEUs. You likely will owe more taxes than the amount deducted to satisfy the minimum statutory 
 withholding tax liability required to be withheld in connection with the vesting of the Stock Grant Shares and DEUs. 
 You should consult your tax advisor regarding these matters. 

5 

8. Adjustment in Certain Events 
 In the event of specified changes in the Company's capital structure, the Committee administering the Plan is required 
 to adjust the Stock Grant Shares and DEUs and, if applicable, the performance conditions in an equitable manner to 
 reflect such changes in the Company s capital structure. This letter will continue to apply to your awards as so adjusted.

 contemplated in Section 2(b)) will not be included in the formula for calculating benefits under the Company's 
 employee benefit plans, policies or programs which take compensation into account in computing benefits. 
 10. Regulatory Compliance 
 Under the Plan, the Company is not required to deliver Stock Grant Shares, DEUs or Common Stock if such delivery 
 would violate any applicable law or regulation. If required by any federal or state securities law or regulation, the 
 Company may impose restrictions on your ability to transfer shares received under the Plan. 
 11. Section 409A 
 The awards granted under this letter are intended to be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Internal 
 Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Section 409A ), and this letter shall be construed accordingly. To the extent

 date of your separation from service, and (B) the date of your death. By accepting the award granted under this letter, 
 you agree that the provisions of this Section 11 shall apply to all awards heretofore or hereafter made to you under the 
 Plan, under any predecessor or successor plan, or any other plan providing for payment of amounts that may be 
 considered deferred compensation subject to Section 409A. 
 12. Clawback 
 In the event the Stock Grant Shares or DEUs vest and are issued to you pursuant to the terms of this letter based upon 
 financial results that are required to be restated by the Company at a future date, and the Committee determines that 
 such restatement is based in whole or in part upon any misconduct on your part, then, in addition to any other remedies 
 available to the Company, you, in consideration for the issuance of such Stock Grant Shares or DEUs, agree that you 
 will immediately upon the receipt of written notice of any such determination by the Committee pay to the Company an 
 amount of cash or deliver an amount of shares of Common Stock equal to the Benefit of the Misstatement (as defined 
 below). The term Benefit of the Misstatement means an amount equal to the Extra Shares (as defined below) 
 multiplied by the closing price of the Common Stock on the date that the Stock Grant Shares or DEUs vested. The term 
 Extra Shares means the actual number of Stock Grant Shares or DEUs you received pursuant to Section 1, excluding 
 the amount of any shares that were withheld for taxes, minus the number of Stock Grant Shares or DEUs you would 
 have received had there been no misstatement of the financial results, excluding amounts of any shares that were 
 withheld for taxes. This Section 12 will apply to misstatements of financial results that are discovered within 24 months 
 after the Stock Grant Shares or DEUs vest, but not thereafter.

 information about the Plan or the Committee, please contact the Company's Secretary, WestRock 
 Company, . This letter contains the formal terms and 
 conditions of your award and accordingly should be retained in your files for future reference.

 agreement, if any) 
 (k) unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the Stock Grant Shares, the underlying shares of 
 Common Stock, and the income and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, any 
 service you may provide as a director of a Subsidiary or Affiliate 
 (l) in the event of termination of your employment (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be 
 invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment 
 agreement, if any), your right to vest in the Stock Grant Shares under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the 
 date that you are no longer actively providing services and will not be extended by any notice period e.g. , your period

 taxes), social insurance contributions, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items 
 related to your participation in the Plan Tax-Related Items ), you acknowledge and agree that the ultimate liability for 
 all Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually 
 withheld by the Company or the Employer, and that the Company and or the Employer (a) make no representations or 
 undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Stock Grant Share, 
 including the grant of the Stock Grant Share, the vesting of the Stock Grant Share, the subsequent sale of any shares of 
 Common Stock acquired upon vesting of the Stock Grant Share and the receipt of any dividends, and (b) do not commit 
 to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Stock Grant Share to reduce or 
 eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you become subject to tax 
 in more than one jurisdiction between the date of grant and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that 
 the Company and or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax- 
 Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
 Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, you shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the 
 Company or the Employer, to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, prior to the delivery of shares of Common 
 Stock upon vesting of the Stock Grant Share, if your country of residence (and or the country of employment, if 
 different) requires withholding of Tax-Related Items, the Company may withhold a sufficient whole number of shares 
 of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon vesting of the Stock Grant Share that has an aggregate Fair Market Value 
 sufficient to pay the minimum Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the shares of Common Stock,

or to the extent it would not result in adverse accounting treatment, the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold 
 shares of Common Stock based on a rate of up to the maximum applicable withholding rate. The cash equivalent of the 
 shares of Common Stock withheld will be used to settle the obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items. By accepting 
 the Stock Grant Share, you expressly consent to the withholding of shares of Common Stock as provided for hereunder. 
 Alternatively, you hereby authorize the Company (on your behalf and at your direction pursuant to this authorization) to 
 immediately sell a sufficient whole number of shares of Common Stock acquired upon vesting resulting in sale 
 proceeds sufficient to pay the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld. You agree 
 to sign any agreements, forms and or consents that reasonably may be requested by the Company (or the Company s 
 designated brokerage firm) to effectuate the sale of the shares of Common Stock (including, without limitation, as to the 
 transfer of the sale proceeds to the Company to satisfy the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld). Further, the 
 Company or the Employer may, in its discretion, withhold any amount necessary to pay the Tax-Related Items from 
 your salary or any other amounts payable to you, with no withholding of shares of Common Stock or sale of shares of 
 Common Stock, or may require you to submit a cash payment equivalent to the Tax-Related Items required to be 
 withheld with respect to the vested Stock Grant Share. 
 If the Company applies the maximum applicable withholding rate for any of the withholding methods previously 
 described, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the stock 
 equivalent. You shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax- Related Items that the Company or the 
 Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied 
 by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares of Common Stock or the 
 proceeds of the sale of shares of Common stock, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax- 
 Related Items. 
 All other Tax-Related Items related to the Stock Grant Share and any shares of Common Stock delivered in payment 
 thereof are your sole responsibility. In no event, shall whole shares be withheld by or delivered to the Company in 
 satisfaction of any Tax-Related Items in excess of the maximum statutory tax withholding required by law. If the 
 obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you are 
 deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Stock Grant Share, 
 notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax- 
 Related Items. You agree to indemnify the Company and its Subsidiaries against any and all liabilities, damages, costs 
 and expenses that the Company and its Subsidiaries may hereafter incur, suffer or be required to pay with respect to the 
 payment or withholding of any Tax-Related Items. 
 The Stock Grant Share is intended to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue 
 Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). The Plan and this Stock Grant Certificate shall be administered and interpreted 
 in a manner consistent with this intent. If the Company determines that the Stock Grant Certificate is subject to Code 
 Section 409A and that it has failed to comply with the requirements of that Section, the Company may, in its sole 
 discretion, and without your consent, amend this Stock Grant Certificate to cause it to comply with Code Section 409A 
 or be exempt from Code Section 409A. 
 4. Data Privacy. The Company is located at and grants employees of the Company, Subsidiaries and Affiliates

For the avoidance of doubt, the compensation and benefits provided under this Agreement shall not result in duplication of compensation or benefits provided under any other plan, policy, agreement or arrangement. 
 4. No Mitigation . Upon a Change in Control, other than as provided in Section 2(a), the obligations of the Company to pay or provide the severance payments and benefits as required by this Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that the Company may have against the Executive. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement. Other than as provided in Section 2(a)(ii), no payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement will be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by the Executive to the Company or otherwise.

The Parties hereby consent and agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the State of Georgia for purposes of enforcing this Agreement. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives any right to a trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising under or relating to any provision of this Agreement. 
 6. Section 280G . 
 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, if the Executive is a disqualified individual (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) and any portion of the severance payments or benefits under this Agreement or other payments and benefits the Executive is entitled to receive, has received or would receive in connection with a change in ownership or control (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) (collectively, the Payments would constitute a parachute payment (as defined in Section 280G of the Code), then the Payments shall be either (i) reduced so that the aggregate present value of the Payments will be one dollar less than the amount that would subject the Payments to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or (ii) paid in full (assuming all other requirements for such payment are met), whichever produces the greater net after-tax amount for such Executive (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code and any other applicable tax). 
 (b) If the determination made pursuant to this Section 6 results in a reduction of the Payments, the Company shall promptly give the Executive notice of such determination. Such reduction shall be first applied to reduce any cash payments and shall thereafter be applied to reduce noncash payments and benefits, in each case, in reverse order beginning with the payments or benefits that are to be paid the furthest in time from the date of such determination provided that, in no event may the Payments be reduced in a manner that would result in subjecting the Executive to additional taxation or penalties under Section 409A of the Code. 
 5 

(c) All determinations under this Section 6 shall be made by a nationally recognized firm that specializes in, or is a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm that has a unit that specializes in, determinations under Section 280G of the Code selected by the Company (the Designated Firm ), whose determinations shall be conclusive and binding. In making any such determinations, the Designated Firm shall conduct a reasonable compensation analysis under Section 280G of the Code, including a valuation of any applicable restrictive covenants, and the Company and the Executive shall cooperate in good faith in connection with such valuation. All such determinations by the Designated Firm shall be at the Company s expense. 
 (d) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 280G of the Code, it is possible that payments or benefits will have been paid or provided to or for the Executive s benefit which should not have been so paid or provided (each, an Overpayment or that additional payments or benefits which will have not been paid or provided to or for the Executive s benefit could have been so paid or provided (each, an Underpayment ). In the event that the Designated Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service that the Designated Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or provided shall be repaid by the Executive together with interest at the applicable U.S. Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code provided , however , that no such repayment shall be required if and to the extent such deemed repayment would not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Designated Firm, based on controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid or provided to the Executive together with interest at the applicable U.S. Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code. 
 7. Restrictive Covenants . In consideration for the benefits set forth in this Agreement, the Executive acknowledges and agrees to continue to comply, in accordance with their terms, with any covenants restricting the Executive s ability to compete with the Company that the Executive is subject to under any agreement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, including any agreement that is entered into between the Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries after the date hereof and prior to the Change in Control Date, and, other than the Accrued Obligations, the payment or provision of the payments and benefits provided for in this Agreement shall be contingent on the Executive s continued compliance with such covenants. 
 8. Successors . 
 (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive s legal representatives. 
 (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns. 
 (c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement, Company shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise. 
 9. Miscellaneous . 
 (a) The captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the Parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives. 
 (b) This Agreement is intended to satisfy, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and should be interpreted accordingly. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any installment 
 6 

payments provided under this Agreement shall each be treated as a separate payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement constitutes a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, and if such amount is payable as a result of the Executive s separation from service at such time as the Executive is a specified employee (within the meaning of those terms as defined in Section 409A of the Code), then no payment shall be made, except as permitted under Section 409A of the Code, prior to the first business day after the date that is six months after the Executive s separation from service. Furthermore, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, any amount payable hereunder that constitutes a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code will not be paid prior to the earliest date that is permitted in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Severance Plan, any other severance plan sponsored by the Company or its subsidiaries or any other agreement or arrangement between the Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries which provide for severance payments or benefits upon a separation from service, in each case, as in effect and as applicable to the Executive on the Change in Control Date. 
 (c) To the extent required to avoid any accelerated taxation or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts reimbursable to the Executive under this Agreement shall be paid on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursements (and in-kind benefits provided) during any one year may not affect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year and may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in light of the uncertainty with respect to the proper application of Section 409A of the Code, the Company reserves the right to make amendments to this Agreement and any other Company plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement the Company deems necessary or desirable to avoid the imposition of taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code. In any case, except for any tax amounts withheld by the Company from the payments or other consideration hereunder and any employment taxes required to be paid by the Company, the Executive is solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on the Executive (including any taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Company), and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold the Executive harmless from any or all of such taxes or penalties.

 (f) The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal, state or local taxes as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 
 (g) The Executive s failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision hereof shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such provision or any other provision thereof. 
 (h) The Executive and the Company acknowledge that the employment of the Executive by the Company is at will , and may be terminated by either the Executive or the Company at any time, with or without cause, and with or without prior notice. The Executive acknowledges that this Agreement does not constitute a contract of continued employment for any specified term, or a contract of any type for any benefits or rights of employment, until the Change in Control Date, and that upon a termination of the Executive s employment prior to the Change in Control Date, there shall be no further rights under this Agreement. 
 (i) This Agreement is not intended to limit or restrict, and shall not be interpreted in any manner that limits or restricts, the Executive from exercising any legally protected whistleblower rights (including 
 7 

pursuant to Section 21F of the Exchange Act Section 21F )) or receiving an award for information provided to any government agency under any legally protected whistleblower rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in or about this Agreement prohibits the Executive from (i) filing and, as provided for under Section 21F, maintaining the confidentiality of a claim with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), (ii) providing confidential information to the SEC, or providing the SEC with information that would otherwise violate this Section 9(h), to the extent permitted by Section 21F, (iii) cooperating, participating or assisting in an SEC investigation or proceeding without notifying the Company or (iv) receiving a monetary award as set forth in Section 21F.
