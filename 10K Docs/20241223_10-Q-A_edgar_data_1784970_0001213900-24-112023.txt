NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(UNAUDITED) 

. We currently pursue two corporate strategies. One
business strategy is to continue providing software development services, and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin. 

Software development 

We provide AI-enabled software development services
to our customers, which include developing, designing, and implementing various SAAS software solutions for businesses of all types,
including industrial and other businesses. 

Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy 

Our bitcoin acquisition strategy generally involves
acquiring bitcoin with our liquid assets that exceed working capital requirements, and from time to time, subject to market conditions,
issuing debt or equity securities or engaging in other capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase
bitcoin. 

We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings
and expect to continue to accumulate bitcoin. We have not set any specific target for the amount of bitcoin we seek to hold, and we will
continue to monitor market conditions in determining whether to engage in additional financing to purchase additional bitcoin. 

This overall strategy also contemplates that
we may (i) periodically sell bitcoin for general corporate purposes, including to generate cash for treasury management or in connection
with strategies that generate tax benefits in accordance with applicable law, (ii) enter into additional capital raising transactions
that are collateralized by our bitcoin holdings, and (iii) consider pursuing additional strategies to create income streams or otherwise
generate funds using our bitcoin holdings. 

We believe that, due to its limited supply, bitcoin
offers the opportunity for appreciation in value if its adoption increases and has the potential to serve as a hedge against inflation
in the long-term.

, which consists of the following: 

Purchase of BTC 

Fair value gain from digital assets 

Ending balance 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company held approximately
833 BTC at the total cost of . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the
Company recognized fair value gain of and on digital assets respectively. 

Amended and Restated BTC Trading Contract 

On September 24, 2024, the Company and the Association
Seller entered into an Amended and Restated BTC Trading Contract (the Amended BTC Contract ), which amended and restated
the BTC Contract. Under the Amended BTC Contract, the Company is entitled to purchase up to 5,167 BTC (the Total BTC from
the BTC sellers set forth on Schedule I to the Amended BTC Contract (the Schedule I BTC Sellers through the Association
Seller at a purchase price of US per BTC (subject to an additional purchase price by issuance of warrants to purchase shares of
Common Stock at a nominal exercise price as described below) over a 12-month period commencing on the date of the Amended BTC Contract.
The purchase price for the Total BTC will be paid by the Company in cash or shares of Common Stock. Although the Amended BTC Contract
states that the Association Seller (Party B) owns the virtual currency , to our knowledge, this statement was mistakenly
made. As of the date of the Amended BTC Contract, it were the Schedule I BTC Sellers who are the individual members of the Association
Seller, not the Association Seller itself, who own the BTC to be sold under the Amended BTC Contract. 

To our knowledge, the Association Seller entered
into a cooperation agreement with each Schedule I BTC Sellers (the Cooperation Agreement on the same day when the Amended
BTC Contract was entered. Under the Cooperation Agreement, each Schedule I BTC Seller agrees to transfer a specified number of BTC (as
set forth in the Cooperation Agreement) to a BTC wallet address designated by the Association Seller for the transactions contemplated
under the Amended BTC Contract. 

11 

and the Company will pay the remaining
balance through (i) the issuance of shares of Common Stock (the Shares valued at per share and (ii)
the issuance of warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock at a nominal exercise price (the Warrants ). 

The value of per share for the Shares is
equal to the sum of (i) the Nasdaq Official Closing Price (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) immediately preceding the signing of the Amended
BTC Contract, and (ii) . Using the same per value valuation, the warrants are worth approximately . 

Pursuant to the Amended BTC Contract, the Company
shall exercise its option to purchase BTC thereunder prior to September 24, 2025. While the Company s purchase option thereunder
is time-limited, the Amended BTC Contract itself will remain in effect without a defined expiration date, unless otherwise terminated.
In the event of a breach by either party, the non-breaching party has the right to terminate the agreement. In such case, the breaching
party will be obligated to pay a penalty of to the non-breaching party. 

The
above description of the Amended BTC Contract does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the Amended BTC Contract, a copy of which is attached to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1, filed
with the SEC on September 27, 2024, which is incorporated by reference herein. 

Impact on Company s Capitalization and
Stockholder Approval 

The issuance of securities pursuant to the Amended
BTC Contract will not affect the rights of the Company s existing stockholders, but such issuances will have a significant dilutive
effect on the Company s existing stockholders, including the voting power of the existing stockholders. 

As of the date of this
report, there were issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock . Immediately after
the issuance of the Shares (assuming no exercise of the Warrants), there will be issued and outstanding shares of the Common
Stock, and the ownership percentage of the Company s existing stockholders in the Company will be diluted to approximately .
Assuming full exercise of the Warrants concurrently with the issuance of the Shares, immediately after the issuance of the Shares, there
will be issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, and the ownership percentage of the Company s existing stockholders
in the Company will be further diluted to approximately . 

Pursuant to Nasdaq Rule
5635(a), if an issuer intends to issue common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, in connection with
the acquisition of stock or assets of another company, which may equal or exceed of the outstanding common stock or voting power
on a pre-transaction basis, the issuer generally must obtain the prior approval of its stockholders. Pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5635(d),
if an issuer intends to issue common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, other than in a public offering,
which may equal or exceed of the outstanding common stock or voting power on a pre-transaction basis for a price that is lower than
(i) the Nasdaq Official Closing Price (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) immediately preceding the signing of a binding agreement; or (ii)
the average Nasdaq Official Closing Price of the common stock (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) for the five trading days immediately preceding
the signing of the binding agreement for such common stock, the issuer generally must obtain the prior approval of its stockholders. 

The Shares to be issued to the Schedule I BTC
Sellers in the Amended 5,000 BTC Transaction exceeds the threshold for which stockholder approval is required under Nasdaq Rule 5635(a),
and the Warrant Shares to be issued to the Schedule I BTC Sellers upon the full exercise of the Warrants could result in the issuance
of a number of shares exceeding the threshold and pricing for which stockholder approval is required under Nasdaq 5635(d). As such, the
Company is required to obtain requisite stockholder approval for the Amended BTC Transaction. 

As disclosed in a Preliminary
Information Statement on Schedule 14C filed by the Company on October 3, 2024, the Company has obtained the requisite stockholder approval
for the Amended BTC Transaction in accordance with the Company s articles of incorporation and bylaws on September 24, 2024. 

12 

The Company does not require collateral for accounts
receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable due to estimated credit losses. The Company records
the allowance against bad debt expense through the condensed consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative
expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when
the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. There is no allowance for expected credit loss as the accounts receivable
has been received as at reporting date. 

As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filed on
September 28, 2023, the Company entered into a BTC Trading Contract (the BTC Contract with an autonomous organization
(the Association Seller ), which supports its members in the sale of BTC. While the Association Seller provides services
to facilitate the sale of BTC by its members, it does not exert control over them by ownership or contract, nor does it make decisions
for its members relating to the sale of BTC. None of the members of the Association Seller hold equity, serve as director or officer,
or otherwise have voting power or management rights of the Association Seller. 

Under the BTC Contract, the Company has the right
to purchase up to BTC from the members of the Association Seller (each, a BTC Seller through the Association Seller
at a locked price of /BTC over a 12-month period commencing on September 25, 2023, with payment to be made in the form of cash
or the Company s shares. Although the BTC Contract states that the Association Seller (Party B) owns the virtual currency ,
to our knowledge, this statement was mistakenly made. As of the date of the BTC Contract, it were the individual members of the Association
Seller, not the Association Seller itself, who own the BTC to be sold under the BTC Contract. We believe the Association Seller will
coordinate with its members to fulfill the Company s purchase of BTC, however, we cannot guarantee that the Company will be able
to purchase BTC from the BTC Sellers. The BTC Contract was entered into solely between the Company and the Association Seller and no
BTC Sellers owe any legal obligation to the Company in connection with the purchase and sale of BTC. 

Following the execution of the BTC Contract,
the Company purchased BTC from the BTC Sellers and decided to purchase an additional BTC (the 1,000 BTC Purchase ).
As of December 31, 2023, the Company made a prepayment to the BTC Sellers through the Association Seller of approximately 
(the Prepayment Amount ), representing of the total purchase price for BTC. 

According to the Amendment Agreement, the Company
agreed to pay the aggregate price for the BTC through the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock (the
 Common Stock valued at per share, which was the closing market price of the Common Stock as of May 1, 2024 (the
 Then FMV and warrants to purchase shares of the Common Stock with the exercise price of per share (equal
to of the Then FMV). In connection with the 5,000 BTC Purchase, on May 8, 2024, the Company filed a Preliminary Information Statement
on Schedule 14C (the Preliminary 14C ). Subsequently, the Company decided to cease pursuing the 5,000 BTC Purchase due to
the market fluctuations in BTC and further discussions with the BTC Sellers, which was previously disclosed on a Form 8-K filed by the
Company on June 26, 2024.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere
in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report. 

Business 

Next Technology Holding Inc. (formerly known
as WeTrade Group Inc. was incorporated in the State of Wyoming on March 28, 2019. We currently pursue two corporate strategies.
One business strategy is to continue providing software development services, and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin. 

Software development 

We provide AI-enabled software development services
to our customers, which include developing, designing, and implementing various SAAS software solutions for businesses of all types,
including industrial and other businesses. 

Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy 

Our bitcoin acquisition strategy generally involves
acquiring bitcoin with our liquid assets that exceed working capital requirements, and from time to time, subject to market conditions,
issuing debt or equity securities or engaging in other capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase
bitcoin. 

We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings
and expect to continue to accumulate bitcoin. We have not set any specific target for the amount of bitcoin we seek to hold, and we will
continue to monitor market conditions in determining whether to engage in additional financing to purchase additional bitcoin. 

This overall strategy also contemplates that
we may (i) periodically sell bitcoin for general corporate purposes, including to generate cash for treasury management or in connection
with strategies that generate tax benefits in accordance with applicable law, (ii) enter into additional capital raising transactions
that are collateralized by our bitcoin holdings, and (iii) consider pursuing additional strategies to create income streams or otherwise
generate funds using our bitcoin holdings. 

We believe that, due to its limited supply, bitcoin
offers the opportunity for appreciation in value if its adoption increases and has the potential to serve as a hedge against inflation
in the long-term.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand
of 668,387. There is no change in cash held during the period. 

Operating activities 

As
of September 30, 2024, our cash flow used in operating activities is 81,332 for the period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the
net cash flow from operating activities of 11,886,808 in
prior period. The decrease was mainly due to the turnaround of the net profit of 13.9 million from the net losses of 13.7 million in
prior reporting period. 

Investing activities 

Cash provided used in investing activities was
 nil for the period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash used in investing activities of 37,115,500 in prior period. The decrease
is mainly due to no digital assets being purchased during the period. 

Financing activities 

Cash provided by our financing activities was
 81,332 for the period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 17,203,894. The decrease is
mainly due to lesser in shareholders advance and no issuance of stock during the period as compared to the prior period. 

Inflation 

Inflation does not materially affect our business
or the results of our operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

We prepare our financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP ). GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting
and disclosure rules and requirements. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results could differ from those
estimates. We use historical data to assist in the forecast of our future results. Deviations from our projections are addressed when
our financials are reviewed on a monthly basis. This allows us to be proactive in our approach to managing our business. It also allows
us to rely on proven data rather than having to make assumptions regarding our estimates. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

We have reviewed all the recently issued, but
not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company
financial statements. 

20 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company 
as defined by Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and as such are not required to provide the information contained in this item pursuant
to Item 305 of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

The management of the Company is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

With respect to the period ended September 30,
2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. 

Based upon our evaluation regarding the period
ended September 30, 2024, the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer, has concluded that its disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple
levels of transaction review. Material weaknesses noted are lack of an audit committee, lack of a majority of outside directors on the
board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;
and management is dominated by two individuals, without adequate compensating controls. However, management believes the financial statements
and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
- Guidance for Smaller Public Companies (the COSO criteria). Based on our assessment, management identified material weaknesses related
to: (i) our internal audit functions; (ii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions; and the lack of multiple levels
of review of our accounting data. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of September 30, 2024, we did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with any
policies and procedures may deteriorate. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible
and may not be economically feasible. To the extent possible, we will implement procedures to assure that the initiation of transactions,
the custody of assets and the recording of transactions will be performed by separate individuals. With proper funding we plan on remediating
the significant deficiencies identified above, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these steps and make any changes
that our management deems appropriate. 

A material weakness is a control deficiency (within
the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 5) or combination of control deficiencies, that results
in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Wyoming Shareholder Lawsuits: Since mid-September
2023, Mr. Zheng Dai, Mr. Pijun Liu, and certain individuals under their control (the Unauthorized Persons had been falsely
and repeatedly holding themselves out as representing and/or authorized to represent the Company. For example, the Unauthorized Persons
caused to be filed certain current reports on Forms 8-K dated September 28, 2023 and October 10, 2023, in which they purported to appoint
new officers and directors. These filings were false and should be disregarded. 

On September 28, 2023, a derivative lawsuit was
filed by certain purported shareholders affiliated with the Unauthorized Persons in the United States District Court for the District
of Wyoming against certain officers and directors of the Company, seeking control of the Company. This case was dismissed without prejudice
on October 18, 2023. 

On October 18, 2023, the same individuals who
filed the above-described derivative suit filed a direct action against the Company in the Chancery Court of the State of Wyoming (the
 Chancery Court ), again seeking control of the Company. The Company responded to the lawsuit, sought a temporary restraining
order restraining the plaintiff-shareholders and their affiliates (including the Unauthorized Persons) from claiming to be in control
of the Company. 

In early 2024, the Court issued an order restraining
the Unauthorized Persons from purporting to control the Company. The Unauthorized Persons lawsuit was subsequently dismissed with
prejudice, meaning they can no longer attempt to assert control over the Company. 

New York Loan Guarantee Litigation: In
May 2024, certain non-U.S. Parties believed to be affiliated with the Unauthorized Persons described above filed a lawsuit in New York
State court against many non-U.S. borrowers, alleging the borrowers have not paid certain loans. These lender-plaintiffs also sued the
Company under alleged guarantees it allegedly signed to guarantee the loans at issue. The Company does not believe these guarantees were
legitimate, nor that New York is the proper place for it. The Company has moved to dismiss. 

Books and records litigation: In September
2024, the Unauthorized Persons filed a lawsuit in Wyoming State court for books and records. The Company does not believe the lawsuit
has merit under Wyoming s books and records statute and is defending this suit. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

We are a smaller reporting company 
as defined by Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and as such are not required to provide the information contained in this item. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES
OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 

Capitalization 

On June 9, 2023, the Wyoming Secretary of State
approved the Company s certificate of amendment to amend its Articles of Incorporation to effect 1 for 185 Reverse Stock Split.
The total issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock decreased from 195,057,503 to 1,054,364 shares, with the
par value unchanged at zero. 

The Reverse Stock Split is intended to more expediently
enable the Company to regain compliance to achieve a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share for continued listing on Nasdaq, as set forth
in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Requirement ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every one-for-one
hundred and eighty-five (185) shares of the Company s Common Stock then issued and outstanding will automatically, and without
any action of the Company or any holder thereof, be combined, converted, and changed into one (1) validly issued and non-assessable share
of Common Stock. fractional shares will be issued to any shareholder, and in lieu of issuing any such fractional shares, the fractional
shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share of Common Stock. 

In September 2023, there were 1,570,600 shares
issued with the total amount of 12,616,454, and the Company s common stock issued has been increased to 2,625,130 shares as of
December 31, 2023. In April 2024, there are 4,351,280 shares issued with the total amount of 14,776,000 for the acquisition of 20 of
associate company and loan conversion to equity, the Company s common stock issued has been increased to 6,976,410 shares as of
September 30, 2024. 

Bitcoin Option Contract 

On May 2, 2024, the Company entered into a Bitcoin
Option Contract (the Option Contract with the Association Seller. Under the Option Contract, the Association Seller agrees
to sell, and the Company has the option to purchase, up to 20,000 BTC at a fixed price of US 60,000 per BTC over a three-year period
commencing on May 2, 2024. The Company can exercise this option at any time during the three-year period, either in one or multiple transactions,
as mutually agreed upon by both parties. Payments for the BTC can be made in cash or in the Company s common stock, at the Company s
discretion. In addition, the Option Contract allows for an optional 10 advance payment in cash if agreed upon by both parties. Although
the Option Contract states that the Association Seller (Party B) owns the virtual currency , to our knowledge, this statement
was mistakenly made. As of the date of the Option Contract, it were the individual members of the Association Seller, not the Association
Seller itself, who own the BTC to be sold under the Option Contract. 

As of the date of this report, the Company has
not paid any advance payment, nor exercised its option to purchase any BTC under the BTC Option Contract. Further, the Company does not
intend to exercise its option to purchase any BTC under the BTC Option Contract. 

The above description of the Option Contract
does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Option Contract, a copy of which
is attached to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2, filed with the SEC on May 6, 2024, which is incorporated
by reference herein.

shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Exercise be required. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the
Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the
Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation as soon as reasonably practicable of the date on which the final
Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total
number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable

showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice
of Exercise within two (2) Business Day of receipt of such notice. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant,

face hereof. 

b) Exercise Price . The exercise price per share of Common Stock under this Warrant shall be equal to the par value of Common Stock
set forth in the Company s Articles of Incorporation, dated March 28, 2019, as amended from time to time, subject to adjustment

 Mechanics of Exercise . 

i. Delivery
of Warrant Shares Upon Exercise . The Company shall cause the Warrant Shares purchased hereunder to be transmitted by the
Transfer Agent to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder s or its designee s balance account with The
Depository Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal at Custodian system DWAC if the Company is then a
participant in such system and either (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the Warrant Shares
to or resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder or (B) the Warrant Shares are eligible for resale by the Holder without volume or
manner-of-sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144, and otherwise by physical delivery of a certificate, registered in the
Company s share register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Warrant Shares to which the Holder is
entitled pursuant to such exercise to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise by the date that is the earliest
of (i) two (2) Trading Days after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise, (ii) one (1) Trading Day after delivery of
the aggregate Exercise Price to the Company and (iii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period after the
delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise (such date, the Warrant Share Delivery Date ). Upon delivery
of the Notice of Exercise, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Warrant
Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date of delivery of the Warrant Shares, provided
that payment of the aggregate Exercise Price is received within the earlier of (i) two (2) Trading Days and (ii) the number of
Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period following delivery of the Notice of Exercise. If the Company fails for any
reason to deliver to the Holder the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company
shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each 1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such
exercise (based on the VWAP of the Common Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), 10 per Trading Day (increasing
to 20 per Trading Day on the third Trading Day after the Warrant Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day after such Warrant Share
Delivery Date until such Warrant Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such exercise. The Company agrees to maintain a transfer
agent that is a participant in the FAST program so long as this Warrant remains outstanding and exercisable. As used herein,
 Standard Settlement Period means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the
Company s primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of
Exercise. 

6 

VWAP means, for any date,
the price determined by the first of the following clauses that applies: (a) if the Common Stock is then listed or quoted on a Trading
Market, the daily volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for such date (or the nearest preceding date) on the Trading Market
on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted as reported by Bloomberg (based on a Trading Day from 9:30 a.m. (New York City time)
to 4:02 p.m. (New York City time)), (b) if the OTCQB Venture Market OTCQB or the OTCQX Best Market OTCQX is not a Trading Market, the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for such date (or the nearest preceding date) on OTCQB
or OTCQX as applicable, (c) if the Common Stock is not then listed or quoted for trading on OTCQB or OTCQX and if prices for the Common
Stock are then reported on the Pink Open Market Pink Market operated by the OTC Markets, Inc. (or a similar organization
or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices), the most recent bid price per share of the Common Stock so reported, or (d)
in all other cases, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by an independent appraiser selected in good faith
by the Purchasers of a majority in interest of the Securities then outstanding and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the fees and
expenses of which shall be paid by the Company. 

ii. Delivery of New Warrants Upon Exercise . If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of
a Holder and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant
evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in
all other respects be identical with this Warrant. 

iii.
 Rescission Rights . If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section
2(d)(i) by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind such exercise. 

iv. Compensation
for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Warrant Shares Upon Exercise . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if
the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
2(d)(i) above pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by
its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares
of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon
such exercise (a Buy-In ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x)
the Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds
(y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection
with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B)
at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise
was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations
hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect
to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of 10,000, under
clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the
Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence
of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder,
at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s
failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

7 

v. 
 No Fractional Shares or Scrip . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of
this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall,
at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share. 

vi. Charges, Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax
or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such Warrant Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company,
and such Warrant Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder; provided ,
 however , that, in the event that Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when
surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the Company may require,
as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The Company shall pay
all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Exercise and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another
established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Warrant Shares. 

vii. 
 Closing of Books . The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise
of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof. 

e) Holder s
Exercise Limitations . The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to
exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance
after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates, and any
other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates (such Persons,
 Attribution Parties )), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined
below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its
Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with
respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable
upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates
or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the
Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties.
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the
Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the
limitation contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other
securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is
exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the
Holder s determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together
with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.
In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the
Company s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public
announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within one Trading Day confirm
orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including
this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of
Common Stock was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 of the number of shares of the
Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of this Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of
this Section 2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common
Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant held by
the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will
not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be
construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this
paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein
contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations
contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.

Section 3 . Certain Adjustments . 

a) Stock Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares
of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon exercise of this
Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse
stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the Common
Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the
numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event
and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of
shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant
shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for
the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective
date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re- classification. 

b) Pro
Rata Distributions . During such time as this Warrant is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution
of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including,
without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification,
corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a Distribution ), at any time after
the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent
that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete
exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as
of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution provided ,
 however , that, to the extent that the Holder's right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the Holder exceeding
the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent (or in
the beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent) and the portion of such Distribution
shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder
exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). 

9 

c) Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company (or any Subsidiary), directly or indirectly,
effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in
one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the
Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares
for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50 or more of the outstanding Common Stock or 50 or
more of the voting power of the common equity of the Company, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which
the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly,
in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without
limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby
such other Person or group acquires 50 or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or 50 or more of the voting power of the common
equity of the Company (each a Fundamental Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the
Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to
the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) or Section
2(f) on the exercise of this Warrant), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company,
if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the Alternate Consideration receivable as
a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately
prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) or Section 2(f) on the exercise of this Warrant).
For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction,
and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value
of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash
or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration
it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the
event of a Fundamental Transaction, the Company or any Successor Entity (as defined below) shall, at the Holder s option, exercisable
at any time concurrently with, or within 30 days after, the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction (or, if later, the date of the
public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction), purchase this Warrant from the Holder by paying to the Holder an amount
of cash equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined below) of the remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant on the date of the consummation
of such Fundamental Transaction; provided , however , that, if the Fundamental Transaction is not within the Company's control,
including not approved by the Company's Board of Directors, the Holder shall only be entitled to receive from the Company or any Successor
Entity the same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion), at the Black Scholes Value of the unexercised portion of
this Warrant, that is being offered and paid to the holders of Common Stock of the Company in connection with the Fundamental Transaction,
whether that consideration be in the form of cash, stock or any combination thereof, or whether the holders of Common Stock are given
the choice to receive from among alternative forms of consideration in connection with the Fundamental Transaction; provided ,
 further , that if holders of Common Stock of the Company are not offered or paid any consideration in such Fundamental Transaction,
such holders of Common Stock will be deemed to have received common stock of the Successor Entity (which Entity may be the Company following
such Fundamental Transaction) in such Fundamental Transaction. Black Scholes Value means the value of this Warrant
based on the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model obtained from the OV function on Bloomberg determined as of the day of
consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction for pricing purposes and reflecting (A) a risk-free interest rate corresponding
to the U.S. Treasury rate for a period equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental
Transaction and the Termination Date, (B) an expected volatility equal to the greater of (1) the 30 day volatility, (2) the 100 day volatility
or (3) the 365 day volatility, each of clauses (1)-(3) as obtained from the HVT function on Bloomberg (determined utilizing a 365 day
annualization factor) as of the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental
Transaction, (C) the underlying price per share used in such calculation shall be the highest VWAP during the period beginning on the
Trading Day immediately preceding the public announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction (or the consummation
of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, if earlier) and ending on the Trading Day of the Holder s request pursuant to this Section
3(e), (D) a remaining option time equal to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental
Transaction and the Termination Date, and (E) a zero cost of borrow. The payment of the Black Scholes Value will be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds (or such other consideration) within the later of (i) five Business Days of the Holder s election
and (ii) the date of consummation of the Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction
in which the Company is not the survivor (the Successor Entity to assume in writing all of the obligations of the
Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(e) pursuant to written
agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior
to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security
of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable
for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common
Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior
to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock
(but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such
shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic
value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in
form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall be added to the
term Company under this Warrant (so that from and after the occurrence or consummation of such Fundamental Transaction,
each and every provision of this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Company shall refer instead
to each of the Company and the Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally), and the Successor Entity or Successor
Entities, jointly and severally with the Company, may exercise every right and power of the Company prior thereto and the Successor Entity
or Successor Entities shall assume all of the obligations of the Company prior thereto under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents
with the same effect as if the Company and such Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally, had been named as the
Company herein. For the avoidance of doubt, the Holder shall be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of this Section 3(e) regardless
of (i) whether the Company has sufficient authorized shares of Common Stock for the issuance of Warrant Shares and/or (ii) whether a
Fundamental Transaction occurs prior to the Initial Exercise Date. 

10 

d) Calculations . All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the
case may be. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date
shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

e) Notice to Holder . 

i. Adjustment
to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall promptly
deliver to the Holder by email a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the number
of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

ii. Notice to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on
the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the Company
shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital
stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection with any reclassification
of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) is a party, any sale or transfer of
all or substantially all of its assets, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities,
cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs
of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be delivered by email to the Holder at its last email address as it shall
appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter
specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption,
rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to
such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders
of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable
upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to deliver such notice
or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such
notice. To the extent that any notice provided in this Warrant constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report
on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the
effective date of the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.

 Representation by the Holder . The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants that it is acquiring this Warrant and,
upon any exercise hereof, will acquire the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, for its own account and not with a view to or for
distributing or reselling such Warrant Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities
law, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act. 

12 

Section 5 . Miscellaneous . 

a) 
 No Rights as Stockholder Until Exercise; No Settlement in Cash . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights,
dividends or other rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in Section 2(d)(i), except as expressly
set forth in Section 3. Without limiting any rights of a Holder to receive cash payments pursuant to Section 2(d)(i) and Section 2(d)(iv)
herein, in no event shall the Company be required to net cash settle an exercise of this Warrant. 

b) 
 Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant Shares,
and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of the Warrant,
shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate, if mutilated, the
Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant
or stock certificate. 

c) 
 Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required
or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding Business
Day. 

d) 
 Authorized Shares . 

The Company
covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient
number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company
further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of issuing
the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action
as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation,
or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares
which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented
by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any
transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue). 

13 

Except and
to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending its
certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities
or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but will at all
times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate
to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior
to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and
legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary
to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant. 

Before taking
any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the Exercise
Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from any public
regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof. 

e) 
 Jurisdiction . All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined
in accordance with the provisions of the Amended and Restated BTC Trading Contract. 

f) 
 Restrictions . The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered, will
have restrictions upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws. 

g) 
 Nonwaiver and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right
hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies.
Without limiting any other provision of this Warrant or the Amended and Restated BTC Trading Contract, if the Company willfully and knowingly
fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant, which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the
Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys 
fees, including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing
any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder. 

h) 
 Notices . Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given
or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of the Amended and Restated BTC
Trading Contract. 

14 

i) 
 Limitation of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to
purchase Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the
Holder for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the Company. 

j) 
 Remedies . The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will
be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation
for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert the defense
in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

k) 
 Successors and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns
of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and shall
be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares. 

l) 
 Amendment . This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and
the Holder. 

m) 
 Severability . Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining
provisions of this Warrant. 

n) Headings .
The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of this
Warrant.
