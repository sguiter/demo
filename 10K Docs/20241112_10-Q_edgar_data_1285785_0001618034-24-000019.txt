 Foreign currency translation ) ) ) Balance as of September 30, 2024 We will perform our next annual goodwill impairment analysis for each of our reporting units as of October 31, 2024. Subsequent to our 2023 annual evaluation, on December 28, 2023, Brazil enacted a tax law change that eliminates the VAT preference starting in 2024. We are assessing the full impact of this change along with outlook for the business. The current estimated fair value of our Mosaic Fertilizantes reporting unit is not significantly in excess of its carrying value. Because we currently believe that our long-term financial goals for this reporting unit will be achieved, we concluded that the goodwill assigned to this reporting unit was not impaired, but could be at risk of future impairment.

 million into two trust funds (together, the RCRA Trusts created to provide additional financial assurance in the form of cash for the estimated costs Gypstack Closure Costs of closure and long-term care of our Florida and Louisiana phosphogypsum management systems Gypstacks ), as described further in Note 10 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our actual Gypstack Closure Costs are generally expected to be paid by us in the normal course of our Phosphate business; however, funds held in each of the RCRA Trusts can be drawn by the applicable governmental authority in the event we cannot perform our closure and long-term care obligations. When our estimated Gypstack Closure Costs with respect to the facilities associated with a RCRA Trust are sufficiently lower than the amount on deposit in that RCRA Trust, we have the right to request that the excess funds be released to us. The same is true for the RCRA Trust balance remaining after the completion of our obligations, which will be performed over a period that may not end until decades or more after a Gypstack has been closed. The investments held by the RCRA Trusts are managed by independent investment managers with discretion to buy, sell and invest pursuant to the objectives and standards set forth in the related trust agreements. Amounts reserved to be held or held in the RCRA Trusts (including losses or reinvested earnings) are included in other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The RCRA Trusts hold investments, which are restricted from our general use, in marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. As a result, unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income until realized, unless it is determined that the entire unamortized cost basis of the investment is not expected to be recovered. A credit loss would then be recognized in operations for the amount of the expected credit loss. As of September 30, 2024, we expect to recover our amortized cost on all available-for-sale securities and have not established an allowance for credit loss. 
 We review the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. We determine the fair market values of our available-for-sale securities and certain other assets based on the fair value hierarchy described below: 
 Level 1: Values based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2: Values based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 
 Level 3: Values generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.

Under the terms of the agreement, we may borrow up to of the value of the inventory. It is later repurchased by Mosaic at the original sale price plus interest and any transaction costs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had financed inventory of million and , respectively, under this arrangement, which is included in short-term debt on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 million at any point in time. The purchase price of the receivable sold under the RPA is the face value of the receivable less an agreed upon discount. The receivables sold under the RPA are accounted for as a true sale. Upon sale, these receivables are removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash received is presented as cash provided by operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold approximately million and million, respectively, of accounts receivable under this arrangement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold approximately million and billion, respectively, under this arrangement. Discounts on sold receivables were not material for any period presented. Following such sales, we continue to service the collection of the receivables on behalf of the banks without further consideration. As of September 30, 2024, million had been collected but not yet remitted to the bank. As of December 31, 2023, there was amount outstanding to be remitted to the banks. Any outstanding amount is classified in accrued liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collected and remitted are presented as cash used in financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Structured Accounts Payable Arrangements 
 In Brazil, we finance some of our potash-based fertilizer, sulfur, ammonia and other raw material product purchases through third-party contractual arrangements. These arrangements provide that the third-party intermediary advance the amount of the scheduled payment to the vendor, less an appropriate discount, at a scheduled payment date. Mosaic then makes payment to the third-party intermediary at dates ranging from to days from date of shipment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total structured accounts payable arrangements were million and million, respectively. 
 Commercial Paper Note Program 
 In September 2022, we established a commercial paper program which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities that vary, but do not exceed days from the date of issue, up to a maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any time of billion. We plan to use the revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under the commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2024, we had million outstanding under this program, with a weighted average interest rate of and remaining average term of . As of December 31, 2023, we had million outstanding under this program, with a weighted average interest rate of and a remaining average term of .

 North America Gypstack Closure Costs 
 A majority of our ARO relates to Gypstack Closure Costs in Florida and Louisiana. For financial reporting purposes, we recognize our estimated Gypstack Closure Costs at their present value. This present value determined for financial reporting purposes is reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities. 
 As discussed below, we have arrangements to provide financial assurance for the estimated Gypstack Closure Costs associated with our facilities in Florida and Louisiana. 
 EPA RCRA Initiative. On September 30, 2015, we and our subsidiary, Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC Mosaic Fertilizer ), reached agreements with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA ), the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ ), the Florida Department of Environmental Protection FDEP and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality on the terms of consent decrees (collectively, the 2015 Consent Decrees to resolve claims relating to our management of certain waste materials onsite at our Riverview, New Wales, Green Bay, South Pierce and Bartow fertilizer manufacturing facilities in Florida, and our Faustina and Uncle Sam facilities in Louisiana. This followed a 2003 announcement by the EPA Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance that it would be targeting facilities in mineral processing industries, including phosphoric acid producers, for a thorough review under the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA and related state laws. As discussed below, a separate consent decree was previously entered into with the EPA and the FDEP with respect to RCRA compliance at the Plant City, Florida phosphate concentrates facility (the Plant City Facility that we acquired as part of our acquisition of the Florida phosphate assets and assumption of certain related liabilities of CF Industries, Inc. CF ). 
 The remaining monetary obligations under the 2015 Consent Decrees include a provision of additional financial assurance for the estimated Gypstack Closure Costs for Gypstacks at the covered facilities. The RCRA Trusts are discussed in Note 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we have agreed to guarantee the difference between the amounts held in each RCRA Trust (including any earnings) and the estimated closure and long-term care costs. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the undiscounted amount of our Gypstack Closure Costs ARO associated with the facilities covered by the 2015 Consent Decrees, determined using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes, was approximately billion, and the present value of our Gypstack Closure Costs ARO reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for those facilities was approximately million.

 million, which reflects our closure cost estimates as of March 7, 2024. The other financial assurance arrangement was also a trust fund (the Bonnie Facility Trust established to meet the requirements under Florida financial assurance regulations that apply to the Bonnie Facility. In July 2018, we received million from the Bonnie Facility Trust by substituting for the trust fund a financial test mechanism Bonnie Financial Test supported by a corporate guarantee as allowed by state regulations. Both financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope, technological developments, new information, cost inflation, changes in regulations, discount rates and the timing of activities. Under our current approach to satisfying applicable requirements, additional financial assurance would be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed the face amount of the Plant City Bond or the amount supported by the Bonnie Financial Test. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate amounts of AROs associated with the combined Plant City Facility and Bonnie Facility Gypstack closure costs included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were million and million, respectively. The aggregate amount represented by the Plant City Bond exceeds the present value of the aggregate amount of ARO associated with that facility. This is because the amount of financial assurance we are required to provide represents the aggregate undiscounted estimated amount to be paid by us in the normal course of our Phosphate business over a period that may not end until decades or more after the Gypstack has been closed, whereas the ARO included in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects the discounted present value of those estimated amounts.

 million to million. The decrease is primarily related to statute expirations and settlements, partially offset by recording U.S. and non-U.S. reserves and foreign exchange. If recognized, approximately million in unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate and net earnings in future periods. 
 We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our income tax provision. We had accrued interest and penalties totaling million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, that were included in other noncurrent liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Accounting for uncertain tax positions is determined by prescribing the minimum probability threshold that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. Mosaic is continually under audit by various authorities in the normal course of business. Such tax authorities may raise issues contrary to positions taken by the Company. If such positions are ultimately not sustained by the Company, this could result in material assessments to the Company. The costs related to defending, if needed, such positions on appeal or in court may be material. The Company believes that any issues raised have been properly accounted for in its current financial statements. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, discrete tax items recorded in tax expense was a benefit of approximately million. The net tax benefit consisted primarily of the true up of estimates from our U.S. tax return provision and changes in valuation allowance. In addition to items specific to the period, our income tax rate is impacted by the mix of earnings across the jurisdictions in which we operate, by a benefit associated with depletion, and by the impact of certain entities being taxed in both their foreign jurisdiction and the U.S., including foreign tax credits for various taxes incurred. 
 Generally, for interim periods, income tax is equal to the total of (1) year-to-date pretax income multiplied by our forecasted effective tax rate, plus (2) tax expense items specific to the period. In situations where we expect to report losses for which we do not expect to receive tax benefits, we are required to apply separate forecasted effective tax rates to those jurisdictions rather

 million compared to what would have been recorded under the general rule on a consolidated basis. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, discrete tax items recorded in tax expense was an expense of approximately million. The net tax expense consisted primarily of the impact of accruing withholding tax expense on expected foreign distributions associated with changes in management s indefinite reinvestment assertion on select foreign earnings under ASC 740-30 (formerly APB 23), share-based excess benefit, true-up of estimates from our U.S and non-U.S. tax return provisions, non-U.S. audit settlements, and other miscellaneous costs. In addition to items specific to the period, our income tax rate is impacted by the mix of earnings across the jurisdictions in which we operate, by a benefit associated with depletion, and by the impact of certain entities being taxed in both their foreign jurisdiction and the U.S., including foreign tax credits for various taxes incurred.

 Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features 
 Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that are governed by International Swap and Derivatives Association agreements with the counterparties. These agreements contain provisions that allow us to settle for the net amount between payments and receipts, and also state that if our debt were to be rated below investment grade, certain counterparties could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. We have no cash collateral posted in association with

 million of collateral assets, which are either cash or U.S. Treasury instruments, to the counterparties. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 We enter into foreign exchange, certain commodity and interest rate derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of highly rated counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. While we may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non-performance by these counterparties, material losses are not anticipated. We closely monitor the credit risk associated with our counterparties and customers and to date have not experienced material losses.

 months. Most of the valuations are adjusted by a forward yield curve or interest rates. In such cases, these derivative contracts are classified within Level 2. Some valuations are based on exchange-quoted prices, which are classified as Level 1. Changes in the fair market values of these contracts are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as a component of cost of goods sold in our Corporate, Eliminations and Other segment, or foreign currency transaction (gain) loss. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the gross asset position of our foreign currency derivative instruments was million and million, respectively, and the gross liability position of our foreign currency derivative instruments was million and million, respectively. 
 Commodity Derivatives - The commodity contracts primarily relate to natural gas. The commodity derivative instruments that we currently use are forward purchase contracts and swaps. The natural gas contracts settle using NYMEX futures or AECO price indexes, which represent fair value at any given time. The contracts maturities and settlements are scheduled for future months and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. Quoted market prices from NYMEX and AECO are used to determine the fair value of these instruments. These market prices are adjusted by a forward yield curve and are classified within Level 2. Changes in the fair market values of these contracts are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as a component of cost of goods sold in our Corporate, Eliminations and Other segment. The gross asset position of our commodity derivative instruments was as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the gross liability position of our commodity instruments was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Interest Rate Derivatives - We manage interest expense through interest rate contracts to convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. From time to time, we also enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to changes in future interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. Valuations are based on external pricing sources and are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair market values of these contracts are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as a component of interest expense. We did not hold any interest rate derivative positions as of September 30, 2024.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, expenditures for these known conditions currently are not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material effect on our business or financial condition. However, material expenditures could be required in the future to remediate the contamination at known sites or at other current or former sites or as a result of other environmental, health and safety matters. Below is a discussion of the more significant environmental matters. 
 New Wales Phase II East Stack. In April 2022, we confirmed the presence of a cavity in and liner tear beneath the southern part of the active phosphogypsum stack at the Company s New Wales facility in Florida. This resulted in process water draining beneath the stack. The circumstances were reported to the FDEP and the EPA. Phase I of the repairs, consisting of stabilizing the cavity by depositing low pressure grout into it, began in July 2022 and now is complete. Phase II work, which consists of injecting high pressure grout beneath the stack to restore the geological confining layer beneath it, began in early in 2023 and the work is now complete. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have a reserve of million for estimated water management and other costs associated with this event. We are unable to estimate at this time potential future additional financial impacts or a range of loss, if any.

 million for estimated repairs. We are unable to estimate at this time potential future additional financial impacts or a range of loss, if any, due to the ongoing evaluation. 
 EPA RCRA Initiative. We have certain financial assurance and other obligations under consent decrees and a separate financial assurance arrangement relating to our facilities in Florida and Louisiana. These obligations are discussed in Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 10-K Report. 
 Other Environmental Matters. Superfund and equivalent state statutes impose liability without regard to fault or to the legality of a party s conduct on certain categories of persons who are considered to have contributed to the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Under Superfund, or its various state analogues, one party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its proportionate share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. Currently, certain of our subsidiaries are involved or concluding involvement at several Superfund or equivalent state sites. Our remedial liability from these sites, alone or in the aggregate, currently is not expected to have a material effect on our business or financial condition. As more information is obtained regarding these sites and the potentially responsible parties involved, this expectation could change. 
 We believe that, pursuant to several indemnification agreements, our subsidiaries are entitled to at least partial, and in many instances complete, indemnification for the costs that may be expended by us or our subsidiaries to remedy environmental issues at certain facilities. These agreements address issues that resulted from activities occurring prior to our acquisition of facilities or businesses from parties including, but not limited to: ARCO (BP); Beatrice Fund for Environmental Liabilities; Conoco; Conserv; Estech, Inc.; Kaiser Aluminum Chemical Corporation; Kerr-McGee Inc.; PPG Industries, Inc.; The Williams Companies; CF; and certain other private parties. Our subsidiaries have already received and anticipate receiving amounts pursuant to the indemnification agreements for certain of their expenses incurred to date as well as future anticipated expenditures. We record potential indemnifications as an offset to the established accruals when they are realizable or realized. The failure of an indemnitor to fulfill its obligations could result in future costs that could be material. 
 Louisiana Parishes Coastal Zone Cases 
 Several Louisiana parishes and the City of New Orleans have filed lawsuits against hundreds of oil and gas companies seeking regulatory, restoration and compensatory damages in connection with historical oil, gas and sulfur mining and transportation operations in the coastal zone of Louisiana. Mosaic is the corporate successor to certain companies which performed these types of operations in the coastal zone of Louisiana. Mosaic has been named in two of the lawsuits filed to date. In addition, in several other cases, historical oil, gas and sulfur operations which may have been related to Mosaic s corporate predecessors have been identified in the complaints. Based upon information known to date, Mosaic has contractual indemnification rights against third parties for any loss or liability arising out of these claims pursuant to indemnification agreements entered into by Mosaic s corporate predecessor(s) with third parties. There may also be insurance contracts which may respond to some or all of the claims. However, the financial ability of the third-party indemnitors, the extent of potential insurance coverage and the extent of potential liability from these claims is currently unknown. 
 A memorandum of understanding has been executed by the State of Louisiana and the plaintiff parishes that filed suit against Mosaic and its corporate predecessors on one hand, and Mosaic Global Holdings Inc. and its third-party indemnitors on the other hand MOU to resolve all claims among the parties. The initial funding obligations under the MOU have been made in accordance with the provisions of the MOU and dismissals with prejudice have been filed in all cases where final jurisdiction is established. Two cases remain subject to jurisdictional appeals; however, those cases shall be dismissed with prejudice upon a final decision confirming jurisdiction. Terms of the MOU include the possibility of additional fixed obligations pending legislative acts, however to the extent those fixed obligations include any additional funding, we expect those obligations to be undertaken by third-party indemnitors and/or insurers.

 million. We estimate that our probable aggregate loss with respect to these claims is approximately million, which is included in our accrued liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024. Approximately million of the foregoing maximum potential loss relates to labor claims, of which approximately million is included in accrued liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024. 
 Based on Brazil legislation and the current status of similar labor cases involving unrelated companies, we believe we have recorded adequate loss contingency reserves sufficient to cover our estimate of probable losses. If the status of similar cases involving unrelated companies were to adversely change in the future, our maximum exposure could increase and additional accruals could be required. 
 Brazil Tax Contingencies 
 Our Brazilian subsidiaries are engaged in a number of judicial and administrative proceedings relating to various non-income tax matters. We estimate that our maximum potential liability with respect to these matters is approximately million, of which million is subject to an indemnification agreement entered into with Vale S.A in connection with the Acquisition. 
 Approximately million of the maximum potential liability relates to a Brazilian federal value added tax, PIS and COFINS and tax credit cases, while the majority of the remaining amount relates to various other non-income tax cases. The maximum potential liability can increase with new audits from Brazilian tax authorities. Based on Brazil tax legislation and the current status of similar tax cases involving unrelated taxpayers, we believe we have recorded adequate loss contingency reserves sufficient to cover our estimate of probable losses, which are immaterial. If the status of similar tax cases involving unrelated taxpayer changes in the future, additional accruals could be required. 
 Other Claims 
 We also have certain other contingent liabilities with respect to judicial, administrative and arbitration proceedings and claims of third parties, including tax matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that any of these contingent liabilities will have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 Overview of Consolidated Results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Mosaic had net income of 122.2 million, or 0.38 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of (4.2) million, or (0.01) per diluted share, for the prior year period. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 21 compared to the same period of the prior year, driven by lower finished good sales pricing in our Potash and Mosaic Fertilizantes segments and lower sales volumes across our segments, as discussed further below. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by a foreign currency transaction gain of 100.9 million, compared to a foreign currency transaction loss of 96.9 million in the prior year period. 
 Significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition are listed below. Certain of these factors are discussed in more detail in the following sections of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 In our Phosphate segment, operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were favorable compared to the prior year. They were driven primarily by higher average selling prices and a favorable product mix, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Sales volumes in the current year period were unfavorably impacted by low inventory levels going into the quarter, and by delayed shipments of approximately 80,000 tonnes caused by Hurricanes Francine and Helene. Higher average selling prices were driven by strong demand for the fall season in North America. 
 In our Potash segment, operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower average selling prices as a result of improved global supply, and lower sales volumes in the current year period, due to operational issues and the timing of our summer fill sales program in North America. 

27 

In our Mosaic Fertilizantes segment, operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were unfavorable compared to the same period in the prior year due to a reserve for bad debt related to a customer that entered bankruptcy proceedings during the quarter. Excluding this impact, results benefited from lower material costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices and sales volumes in the current year period compared to the prior year. Sales prices in Brazil have been decreasing as global supply continues to improve. Sales volumes were down compared to the prior year period as a result of lower customer demand in the Brazil agricultural market. 
 In addition to the items referenced above: 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1,772,144 shares of Common Stock in the open market for approximately 50.0 million at an average purchase price of 28.21. 
 Subsequent to quarter end, in October 2024, our Florida Phosphate operations suffered downtime due to Hurricane Milton. We expect production to be impacted by 200,000 to 250,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2024, resulting in idle costs in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Overview of Consolidated Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net income attributable to Mosaic for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.9 million, or 0.02 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of 799.6 million, or 2.39 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were unfavorably impacted by a foreign currency transaction loss of 267.3 million, compared to a gain of 103.0 million in the prior year period. 
 Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected the factors discussed above in the discussion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, in addition to those noted below. Certain of these factors are discussed in more detail in the following sections of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Operating results in our Phosphate segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were lower than the prior year due to unfavorable sales volumes. Lower sales volumes were driven by planned maintenance and turnaround activity at our sites, and delayed shipments due to Hurricanes Francine and Helene as mentioned above in our three month discussion. Phosphate operating results were also impacted by an unfavorable product mix, as our sales volumes included a larger proportion of purchased tonnes than the prior year period. Average selling prices for the nine month period of the current year were favorable as prices have continued trending upwards since the third quarter of 2023, driven by strong demand in North America. Operating results also benefited from lower raw material costs, primarily sulfur and ammonia compared to the prior year period. 
 Operating results in our Potash segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were lower than the prior year. They were driven by lower average selling prices, resulting from improved global supply. This impact was partially offset by higher sales volumes compared to the prior year period, as demand in North America was driven by a strong spring application season and "summer fill" sales program in the current year period. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating results in our Mosaic Fertilizantes segment were significantly more favorable compared to the same period in the prior year. While average selling prices and sales volumes declined in the current year period, due to the factors mentioned above in the three-month discussion, operating results benefited from lower raw material cost and de-stocking of high-priced inventory, which negatively impacted the prior year period. 
 In addition to the items referenced above: 
 On April 29, 2024, we entered into an agreement with Saudi Arabian Mining Company Ma aden to exchange our 25 ownership of the Ma aden Wa ad al Shamal Phosphate Company for 111,012,433 shares of Ma aden. The shares were valued at approximately 1.5 billion on the date of the agreement. We expect this transaction to close later in 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 7,006,632 shares of Common Stock in the open market for approximately 210.4 million at an average purchase price of 30.03.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 28.3 million compared to the same period of prior year, primarily due to an increase of approximately 32 million in our bad debt reserve in our Mosaic Fertilizantes segment. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 5.9 million compared to the same period of prior year, primarily due to the bad debt reserve mentioned above in the three month discussion, partially offset by lower consulting and professional services costs of approximately 16 million, and lower incentive compensation costs of approximately 10 million. 
 Other Operating Expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had other operating expense of 153.2 million, compared to 143.9 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase from the prior year period was primarily due to higher legal reserves in our Mosaic Fertilizantes segment. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had other operating expense of 305.0 million, compared to 214.0 million for the same period of the prior year. The change from the prior year was primarily due to an increase in environmental reserves in our Phosphate segment, compared to the prior year, of approximately 51 million. The current year also included a franchise tax expense of approximately 15 million and an increase in legal reserves of approximately 10 million. In addition, the prior year period included a gain on the sale of the Streamsong Resort of approximately 57 million. This was partially offset by

 Income tax expense was 48.0 million and 152.9 million, and the effective tax rate was 27.6 and 122.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, discrete tax items recorded in tax expense was a benefit of approximately million and an expense of approximately million, respectively. The net tax expense consisted primarily of the impact of accruing withholding tax expense on expected foreign distributions associated with changes in management s indefinite reinvestment assertion on select foreign earnings under ASC 740-30 (formerly APB 23), share-based

excess benefit, true-up of estimates from our U.S. and non-U.S. tax return provisions, non-U.S. audit settlements, and other miscellaneous costs. In addition to items specific to the period, our income tax rate is impacted by the mix of earnings across the jurisdictions in which we operate, by a benefit associated with depletion, and by the impact of certain entities being taxed in both their foreign jurisdiction and the U.S., including foreign tax credits for various taxes incurred. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. In preparing the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make various judgments, estimates and assumptions that could have a significant impact on the results reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We base these estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable by management under the circumstances. Changes in these estimates could have a material effect on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The basis for our financial statement presentation, including our significant accounting estimates, is summarized in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. A summary description of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 10-K Report. Further detailed information regarding our critical accounting estimates is included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition in our 10-K Report. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 301.6 million, short-term debt of 0.8 billion, long-term debt, including current maturities, of approximately 3.3 billion, and stockholders equity of approximately 12.0 billion. We have a target liquidity buffer of up to 3.0 billion, including cash and available committed and uncommitted credit lines. We expect our liquidity to fluctuate from time to time, especially in the first quarter of each year, to manage through the seasonality of our business. We also target debt leverage ratios that are consistent with investment grade credit metrics. Our capital allocation priorities include maintaining our target investment grade metrics and financial strength, sustaining our assets, including ensuring the safety of our employees and reliability of our assets, investing to grow our business, either through organic growth or taking advantage of strategic opportunities, and returning excess cash to shareholders, including by paying dividends. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we returned cash to shareholders through share repurchases of 210.4 million and cash dividends of 204.2 million, and invested 957.7 million in capital expenditures. 
 Funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. We believe funds generated from the expected results of operations and available cash, cash equivalents and borrowings under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities, as needed, will be sufficient to finance our operations, including our capital expenditures, existing strategic initiatives, debt repayments and expected dividend payments, for the next 12 months and beyond. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.49 billion available under our 2.50 billion committed revolving credit facility, approximately 1.0 billion available under our uncommitted facilities and had 2.0 billion available under our 2.5 billion commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility. We consider amounts borrowed under our commercial paper program as a reduction of availability under our revolving credit facility. Our credit facilities, including the revolving credit facility, require us to maintain certain financial ratios, as discussed in Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 10-K Report. We were in compliance with these ratios as of September 30, 2024. 
 All of our cash equivalents are diversified in highly rated investment vehicles. Our cash and cash equivalents are held either in the U.S. or held by non-U.S. subsidiaries and are not subject to significant foreign currency exposures, as the majority are held in investments denominated in U.S. dollars as of September 30, 2024. These funds may create foreign currency transaction gains or losses, however, depending on the functional currency of the entity holding the cash. In addition, there are no significant restrictions that would preclude us from bringing these funds back to the U.S., aside from withholding taxes.

The following table represents a comparison of the net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities, and net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 
 (in millions) Nine months ended September 30, 2024-2023 Cash Flow 2024 2023 Change Percent Net cash provided by operating activities 1,079.9 1,869.1 (789.2) (42) Net cash used in investing activities (984.5) (955.0) (29.5) 3 Net cash used in financing activities (168.6) (1,069.8) 901.2 (84) 
 Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 1.1 billion, compared to 1.9 billion for the same period in the prior year. Our results of operations, after non-cash adjustments, contributed 1.1 billion to cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.6 billion as computed on the same basis for the prior year period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had an unfavorable change in assets and liabilities of 9.9 million, compared to a favorable change of 252.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The change in assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily driven by increases in inventories of 517.3 million and other current and noncurrent assets of 179.7 million, offset by increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 257.8 million and other noncurrent liabilities of 233.9 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of 195.4 million. The increase in inventories was primarily due to higher inventory volumes across our segments in the current year period. The increase in other current and noncurrent assets was primarily related to an increase in taxes receivable. The increase in account payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases and an increase in customer prepayments. The increase in other noncurrent liabilities was primarily related to increases in ARO obligations and environmental reserves in our Phosphate segment in the current year. Accounts receivable decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices in our Potash and Mosaic Fertilizantes segments. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 984.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 955.0 million for the same period a year ago. We had capital expenditures of 957.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.0 billion in the prior year period. The prior year period included net proceeds of 158.4 million from the sale of a business and used cash of 41.0 million to acquire the other 50 of an equity investment. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 168.6 million, compared to 1.1 billion for the same period in the prior year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds of 200 million under our inventory financing arrangement and 151.5 million under other short-term debt arrangements. During the current year period, we made repurchases of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 210.4 million and paid dividends of 204.2 million. In addition, we made payments on long-term debt of 55.2 million and net payments on our structured accounts payable arrangements of 12.1 million.

Financial Assurance Requirements 
 In addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our Phosphate segment, we are subject to financial assurance requirements. In various jurisdictions in which we operate, particularly Florida and Louisiana, we are required to pass a financial strength test or provide credit support, typically in the form of surety bonds, letters of credit, certificates of deposit or trust funds. Further information regarding financial assurance requirements is included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition in our 10-K Report, under EPA RCRA Initiative, and in Note 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 
 Environmental, Health, Safety and Security Matters 
 Federal Jurisdiction Over Waters of the United States . The Clean Water Act CWA or the Act authorizes federal jurisdiction over navigable waters, defined in the Act as waters of the United States WOTUS ). As it relates to Mosaic s operations and facilities, the scope of the term WOTUS dictates legal requirements for our national pollutant discharge elimination system wastewater discharge permits and for impacts to surface waters and wetlands associated with our phosphate mining operations. A broad definition of WOTUS, and thus the scope of federal jurisdiction, increases the time required to identify wetlands and waterways subject to federal regulatory and permitting requirements, and the amount and type of mitigation required to compensate for impacts to jurisdictional WOTUS caused by our mining operations. 
 On May 25, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in the Sackett v EPA case, which significantly limits water features that can be considered WOTUS and therefore subject to CWA Section 404 jurisdiction. The Court held that the CWA extends only to those wetlands that are as a practical matter indistinguishable from waters of the United States . The Sackett decision is binding nationwide as to the determination of which wetlands and waters are subject to the CWA. 
 The Sackett decision invalidated the January 18, 2023 definition of WOTUS promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA ), which had expanded federal jurisdiction. In response to Sackett , on August 29, 2023, the EPA issued a final rule intended to conform its definition of WOTUS to the Sackett decision. The conforming rule became effective on September 8, 2023. 
 As a result of ongoing litigation, the January 2023 WOTUS rule, as conformed by the September 2023 rule, is being implemented only in 23 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Territories. In the other 27 states, WOTUS is interpreted consistent with the pre-2015 regulatory regime in a manner that such states believe complies with the Supreme Court s Sackett decision. 
 Clean Water Act 404 Permitting Program . Beginning in 2018, the State of Florida enacted statutory and regulatory changes to allow the State to assume dredge and fill permitting under Section 404 of the CWA CWA 404 permitting ). In December 2020, the EPA approved Florida s application to assume CWA 404 permitting and the State began issuing 404 permits for projects impacting assumed waters in the State. A group of Non-Governmental Organizations NGOs filed suit in early 2021 seeking to invalidate the EPA s approval and to return CWA 404 permitting to the federal government. 
 On February 15, 2024, the District Court entered an Order granting the relief requested by the NGOs. Because of the decision, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Corps became the only entity in the State with authority to issue 404 permits. On April 12, 2024, the District Court entered final judgment on the NGO s claims that now can be appealed. On April 15, 2024, the State appealed the District Court s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The Court of Appeals subsequently granted the State s request to expedite that appeal. 
 If the appeal is not successful, CWA 404 permitting for most of Mosaic s proposed Florida mining projects and some improvements to our concentrates facilities would be handled by the Corps. Returning the CWA 404 program to the Corps is likely to result in delays in the permitting process, due to coordination complications and Corps staffing deficiencies, at least over the next six to 12 months. Moreover, all Corps 404 permits are federal actions subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, which is a resource-intensive environmental review that causes additional delays in the permitting process. Corps issued CWA 404 permits also provide an avenue for legal challenges to be filed in Federal court. Given these recent developments, we expect that the schedule for Mosaic s Florida permitting projects will encounter more delays and face potentially greater legal risk of permit challenges.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of currencies, the impact of interest rates, fluctuations in the purchase price of natural gas, ammonia and sulfur consumed in operations and changes in freight costs, as well as changes in the market value of our financial instruments. We periodically enter into derivatives in order to mitigate our foreign currency risks, interest rate risks and the effects of changing commodity prices, but not for speculative purposes. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 10-K Report and Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts 
 Due to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. Our primary foreign currency exposures are the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. To reduce economic risk and volatility on expected cash flows that are denominated in the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real, we use financial instruments that may include forward contracts, zero-cost collars and/or futures. Mosaic hedges cash flows on a declining basis, up to 18 months for the Canadian dollar and up to 12 months for the Brazilian real. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our major foreign currency exchange contracts was 0.3 million and 28.4 million, respectively. The table below provides information about Mosaic s significant foreign exchange derivatives.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded, based on such evaluations, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose for which they were designed as of the end of such period. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, have evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the third quarter of 2024, we completed the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning ERP system. As a result, we have modified or implemented certain internal controls over financial reporting to address the new control environment and processes associated with the new ERP system. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We have included information about legal and environmental proceedings in Note 17 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. This information is incorporated herein by reference. 
 We are also subject to the following legal and environmental proceedings in addition to those described in Note 17 of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report: 
 Countervailing Duty Orders . In April 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce DOC issued countervailing duty CVD orders on imports of phosphate fertilizers from Morocco and Russia, in response to petitions filed by Mosaic. The purpose of the petitions was to remedy the injury to the U.S. phosphate fertilizer industry caused by imports that benefit from unfair foreign subsidies, and thereby restore fair competition. CVD orders normally stay in place for at least five years, with possible extensions. 
 Moroccan and Russian producers have initiated actions at the U.S. Court of International Trade CIT and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit CAFC seeking to overturn the orders. Mosaic has also made claims contesting certain aspects of DOC s final determinations that, we believe, failed to capture the full extent of Moroccan and Russian subsidies. These litigation challenges remain underway. In January 2024, DOC and the ITC issued revised determinations on remand from the CIT, upholding their original determinations that Moroccan phosphate fertilizer is unfairly subsidized, and that Moroccan and Russian imports materially injure the U.S. industry, respectively. The CIT is now reviewing these remand determinations. Also in January 2024, the CIT issued a ruling affirming DOC s original determinations that Russian phosphate fertilizer is unfairly subsidized. Russian producers PhosAgro and EuroChem appealed this ruling to the CAFC, and while the CAFC dismissed PhosAgro s appeal, EuroChem s appeal remains pending. 
 While a CVD order is in place, upon request, DOC can conduct annual administrative reviews, which establish a final CVD assessment rate for past imports during a defined period, and a CVD cash deposit rate for future imports. In November 2023, DOC announced the final results of the first administrative reviews for the CVD orders on phosphate fertilizers for Russia and Morocco, covering the period November 30, 2020 to December 31, 2021. DOC calculated new subsidy rates of 2.12 for Moroccan producer OCP and 28.50 for Russian producer PhosAgro. Commerce did not change the preexisting cash deposit rates for Russian producer EuroChem (47.05 or all other Russian producers (17.20 ). Mosaic, foreign producers, and a U.S. importer have appealed the final results of DOC s first administrative reviews to the CIT. 
 In addition, in November 2024, DOC announced the final results of the second administrative reviews, covering calendar year 2022. DOC calculated new subsidy rates of 21.2 for OCP and 18.21 for PhosAgro. Again, Commerce did not change the preexisting cash deposit rates for EuroChem and all other Russian producers. 
 In June 2024, DOC initiated a third set of administrative reviews covering calendar year 2023. In October 2024, DOC rescinded the third review for Morocco, but left the third review for Russia in place. DOC will likely issue the final results of the third review for Russia by Q4 2025. 
 The applicable final CVD assessment rates and cash deposit rates for imports of phosphate fertilizer from Morocco and Russia could change as a result of these various proceedings and potential associated appeals, whether in federal courts or at the World Trade Organization. 
 The South Pasture Mine Hardee County Enforcement Action . On January 8, 2020, Hardee County issued a Notice of Violation NOV for Mosaic s delay in meeting the required reclamation schedule for two designated reclamation units within the South Pasture mine. The delay resulted from idling the South Pasture beneficiation plant in 2018; because the plant was idled, no sand was available for reclamation activities. 
 Acting on Mosaic s Application for Waiver and Reclamation Schedule Extension, in May 2020, the Hardee County Board of County Commissioners approved: (1) a waiver of the applicable reclamation deadlines of the South Pasture Development Order and Land Development Code; (2) an alternative reclamation schedule; and (3) a settlement agreement that resolved the NOV. Mosaic timely paid the civil penalty required by the settlement agreement and continues to implement the approved alternative 

47

reclamation schedule, as required. Monitoring programs are in place to ensure continued compliance with the waiver and settlement agreement. 
 Cruz Litigation . On August 27, 2020, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit in Hillsborough County, Florida against our wholly owned subsidiary, Mosaic Global Operations Inc., and two unrelated co-defendants. The complaint alleges claims related to elevated levels of radiation at two manufactured housing communities located on reclaimed mining land in Mulberry, Polk County, Florida, allegedly due to phosphate mining and reclamation activities occurring decades ago. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages, including punitive damages, injunctive relief requiring remediation of their properties, and a medical monitoring program funded by the defendants. On October 14, 2021, the court substantially granted a motion to dismiss that we filed late in 2020, with leave for the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. 
 On November 3, 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and, in response, Mosaic filed a motion to dismiss that complaint with prejudice on November 15, 2021. On December 23, 2021, plaintiffs opposed that motion and Mosaic replied to that opposition on January 26, 2022. On April 6, 2022, the court heard argument on the motions to dismiss filed by Mosaic and each other co-defendant. In late March 2023, the court denied defendants motions to dismiss. 
 We intend to continue to vigorously defend this matter. 
 Faustina Plant Risk Management Plan . On September 14, 2022, EPA Region 6 issued a Notice of Potential Violation and Opportunity to Confer NOPVOC regarding compliance of our Faustina Plant with Section 112(r) of the Federal Clean Air Act and 40 C.F.R. Part 68, commonly known as the Risk Management Plan Rule RMP Rule ). The NOPVOC relates to a compliance evaluation inspection conducted by the EPA at the Faustina Plant from February 22-25, 2022, and alleges violations of the RMP Rule. We conferred with the EPA regarding the allegations in the NOPVOC on November 30, 2022. We negotiated a Consent Agreement and Final Order CAFO with the agency that was filed on January 30, 2024. As required by the CAFO, we paid a penalty in the amount of 217,085. The CAFO also requires the completion of two supplemental environmental projects: (1) installation of ammonia monitors and monitoring at the plant for a period of two years, and (2) donation of two generators to the St. James Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness. We completed the donation to the St. James Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness on March 14, 2024, and we completed installation and began operation of the ammonia monitors on April 24, 2024.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Important risk factors that apply to us are outlined in Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 10-K Report ). In addition to these risk factors, we include the following updates: 
 Operational Risk 
 Risks related to the Ma aden Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement. 
 On April 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement with Ma aden under which Mosaic will receive 111,012,433 shares of Ma aden valued at approximately 1.5 billion on the date of the agreement, in exchange for Mosaic s 25 percent stake in MWSPC. The anticipated value of the Ma aden shares to be issued in the proposed transaction at transaction announcement and at closing are subject to risks related to the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the pending transaction, including the inability to receive the required approval by Ma aden shareholders and other approvals, including potential regulatory approvals, necessary to complete the transaction; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the applicable agreement; and the risk that there may be a material adverse change with respect to the financial position, performance, operations or prospects of Ma aden and MWSPC. 
 Regulatory Risk 
 Our operations are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities. Denial or delay by a government agency in issuing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations. 
 Our operations, including our mines, are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities. Denial or delay by a government agency in issuing, modifying or renewing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive or cost prohibitive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, i n Florida, local community involvement has become an increasingly important factor in the permitting process for mining companies, and various counties and other parties in Florida have in the past filed and continue to file lawsuits challenging the issuance or renewal of some of the permits we require. A recent federal court decision invalidated Florida s Clean Water Act 404 dredge and fill permitting program and returned that permitting authority to the federal agencies. While that decision is under appeal, a change in permitting authority may complicate and delay the receipt of 404 approvals. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Pursuant to our employee stock plans relating to the grant of employee stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock unit awards and other equity-based awards, we have granted and may in the future grant employee stock options to purchase shares of our Common Stock for which the purchase price may be paid by means of delivery to us by the optionee of shares of our Common Stock that are already owned by the optionee (at a value equal to market value on the date of the option exercise). During the periods covered by this report, no options to purchase shares of our Common Stock were exercised for which the purchase price was so paid. 
 Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities (a) 
 The following table sets forth information with respect to shares of our Common Stock that we purchased under the repurchase programs during the quarter ended September 30, 2024:

 (a) In the second quarter of 2022, we announced the establishment of a 1.0 billion share repurchase program. On July, 31, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program, effective upon completion of the 1.0 billion program, which allows us to repurchase up to 2.0 billion of our Common Stock through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase arrangements, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The program has no set expiration date. 
 (b) At the end of the month shown. 
 
 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95 to this report. 
 
 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 During our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers informed us of the adoption or termination of a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement as those terms are defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
