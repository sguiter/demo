 From time to time, the Company may become party to litigation in the ordinary course of business, including direct claims brought by or against the Company with respect to intellectual property, contracts, employment and other matters, as well as claims brought against the Company s customers for whom the Company has a contractual indemnification obligation. The Company assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes with respect to these matters and determines loss contingency assessments on a gross basis after assessing the probability of occurrence of a loss and whether a loss is reasonably estimable. In addition, the Company considers other relevant factors that could impact its ability to reasonably estimate a loss. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analyzing each matter. The Company reviews reserves, if any, at least quarterly and may change the amount of any such reserve in the future due to new developments or changes in strategy in handling these matters. Although the results of litigation and threats of litigation, investigations and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company currently has no material pending litigation matters and, accordingly, no material reserves related to litigation.

 Key Operating Metrics 
 In addition to key financial metrics, we regularly review a number of key operating metrics to evaluate our business, determine the allocation of resources and make decisions regarding business strategies. We believe that these metrics can be useful for understanding the underlying trends in our business. 
 Subscribers, subscriber revenue and average revenue per customer from acquisitions are included in these metrics beginning twelve months after the closing of the respective business combination. Accordingly, the metrics include Subscribers, Subscriber revenue, and Average revenue per customer from Pond5 and Splash News beginning May 2023, and, for Average Revenue per Customer, from Giphy beginning July 2024. These metrics exclude the respective counts and revenues from Backgrid and Envato. 
 Subscribers 
 We define subscribers as those customers who purchase one or more of our monthly recurring products for a continuous period of at least three months, measured as of the end of the reporting period. We believe the number of subscribers is an important metric that provides insight into our monthly recurring business. We believe that an increase in our number of subscribers is an indicator of engagement in our platform and potential for future growth. 
 Subscriber Revenue 
 We define subscriber revenue as the revenue generated from subscribers during the period. We believe subscriber revenue, together with our number of subscribers, provide insight into the portion of our business driven by our monthly recurring products. 
 Average Revenue Per Customer 
 Average revenue per customer is calculated by dividing total revenue for the last twelve-month period by customers. We define customers as total active, paying customers that contributed to total revenue over the last twelve-month period. Changes in our average revenue per customer will be driven by changes in the mix of our subscription-based and transactional products as well as pricing in our transactional business. 
 Paid Downloads 
 We define paid downloads as the number of downloads that our customers make in a given period of our content. Paid downloads exclude content related to our Studios business, downloads of content that are offered to customers for no charge (including our free trials), and metadata delivered through our data deal offering. Measuring the number of paid downloads that our customers make in a given period is important because it is a measure of customer engagement on our platform and triggers the recognition of revenue and contributor royalties.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure or inclusion of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. We evaluate our significant estimates on an ongoing basis, including, but not limited to, estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts, the volume of expected unused licenses used in revenue recognition for our subscription-based products, the fair value of acquired goodwill and intangible assets and income tax provisions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 A description of our critical accounting policies that involve significant management judgments appears in our 2023 Form 10-K, under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates. 
 See Note 1 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a full description of the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards on our financial statements. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to our critical accounting policies and estimates included in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 17.3 million, or 7 , to 250.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Revenue was not impacted on a constant currency basis in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 The Company s Content revenues increased by 14 , to 203.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. On a constant currency basis, Content revenues grew 13 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, growth in our Content revenue was driven by the contribution of Envato, which was acquired on July 22, 2024. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in Content revenue generated from Shutterstock s content offering due to weakness in new customer acquisition. 
 The Company s Data, Distribution, and Services revenues decreased by 14 , to 46.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in Data, Distribution, and Services revenues was driven by a decline in our data offering, which was offset by growth in our Distribution and Services offerings. 
 Changes in our revenue by region were as follows: revenue from North America decreased by 2.8 million, or 2 , to 120.5 million, revenue from Europe increased by 12.9 million, or 23 , to 69.5 million and revenue from outside Europe and North America increased by 7.2 million, or 14 , to 60.6 million, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue . Cost of revenue increased by 10.2 million to 104.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased to 42 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 40 for the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by increased royalties, content expenses, and employee-related costs driven by the acquisition of Envato. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in Shutterstock-legacy related royalties, content expenses, production costs and employee-related costs, and a decrease in recurring and non-recurring Giphy Retention Compensation. We expect that our cost of revenue will continue to fluctuate in-line with changes in revenue. 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 0.8 million, or 1 , to 55.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing

 expenses decreased to 22 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 24 for the same period in 2023. This was driven by a decrease in Shutterstock-legacy brand and performance-based marketing expenses and a decrease in consultant expenses. This was partially offset by marketing spend and employee-related costs attributable to the Envato business. In addition, there were 0.9 million and 1.1 million increases from recurring and non-recurring Giphy Retention Compensation expenses, respectively. We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to fluctuate as we optimize our sales channels and invest in new customer acquisition, products and geographies. 
 Product Development . Product development expenses increased by 0.5 million to 28.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in product development was driven by an increase in employee-related costs associated with the Envato business, offset by a decline in Shutterstock-legacy employee-related costs. In addition, there was a 1.2 million decrease and a 2.7 million increase from recurring and non-recurring Giphy Retention Compensation expenses, respectively. We expect product development expenses, of which a portion will be capitalized, to continue in the foreseeable future, as we pursue opportunities to invest in developing new products and internal tools and enhance the functionality of our existing products and technologies. 
 General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses increased by 6.4 million to 44.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by an increase in professional fees and employee-related costs associated with by the Envato business, offset by a decline in the Shutterstock-legacy employee-related costs. In addition, there were 0.7 million and 1.1 million decreases from recurring and non-recurring Giphy Retention Compensation expenses, respectively. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company also incurred 3.2 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Envato. 
 Bargain Purchase Gain . In the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an increase to the Giphy bargain purchase gain of 9.9 million associated with updates to deferred income tax balances recorded on the Giphy opening balance sheet. 
 Interest Expense . In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we recognized interest expense of 4.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively, related to our credit facility and the amortization of deferred financing fees. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to the borrowings under A R Credit Agreement entered into during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to fund the acquisition of Envato. 
 Other Income, Net. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income, net was driven by 1.6 million of unrealized gains related to our investment in Meitu, Inc. In addition, other income, net had 1.1 million of interest income and 1.2 million of unrealized foreign currency gains. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, other income, net substantially consisted of 1.9 million of interest income and 0.8 million of unrealized foreign currency losses. As we increase the volume of business transacted in foreign currencies resulting from international expansion and as currency rates fluctuate, we expect foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate. 
 Income Taxes . The income tax benefit decreased by 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Our effective tax rates yielded a net benefit of 0.5 and 2.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net effect of discrete items decreased the effective tax rate by 32.9 . The discrete items for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relate to reversal of unrecognized tax benefits of 7.3 million due to the settlement of an IRS audit. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate would have been 32.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the net effect of discrete items decreased the effective tax rate by 14.9 . The discrete items for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relate to the effect of the U.S. Research and Development R D tax credit claimed on the Company s 2022 tax return, which was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate would have been 12.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As we continue to expand our operations outside of the United States, we have been and may continue to become subject to taxation in additional non-U.S. jurisdictions and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.

 Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 27.6 million, or 4 , to 685.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Revenue was not impacted on a constant currency basis in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 The Company s Content revenues decreased by 2 , to 547.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact on the Company s Content revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decline in our Content revenues was driven by weakness in new customer acquisition, partially offset by revenue from Envato, which was acquired on July 22, 2024. 
 The Company s Data, Distribution, and Services revenues increased by 41 , to 137.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact on the Company s Data, Distribution, and Services revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Data, Distribution, and Services revenues was driven by growth in our data offering, which grew 22 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as growth in our Distribution and Services offerings. 
 Changes in our revenue by region were as follows: revenue from North America increased by 32.4 million, or 10 , to 351.1 million, revenue from Europe increased by 4.2 million, or 2 , to 178.2 million and revenue from outside Europe and North America decreased by 9.1 million, or 5 , to 155.6 million, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue increased by 27.1 million, or 11 , to 283.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As a percent of revenue, cost of revenue increased to 41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 39 for the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by increased royalty and content costs, costs associated with website hosting, hardware and software licenses, and employee related costs, and depreciation and amortization driven by the acquisition of Envato. We expect that our cost of revenue will continue to fluctuate in line with changes in revenue. 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 11.4 million, or 8 , to 163.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As a percent of revenue, sales and marketing expenses increased to 24 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 23 for the same period in 2023.

 in Shutterstock s performance marketing spend. In addition, there were 3.2 million and 0.8 million increases from recurring and non-recurring Giphy Retention Compensation, respectively. We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to fluctuate as we optimize our sales channels and invest in new customer acquisition, products and geographies. 
 Product Development. Product development expenses decreased by 3.2 million, or 4 , to 69.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in product development was driven by a decrease in outside consultant expenses and a decrease Shutterstock-legacy employee-related costs. This was partially offset by increases in employee-related costs driven by the Envato business. In addition, there was a 2.7 million increase and a 0.7 million decrease from recurring and non-recurring Giphy Retention Compensation expenses, respectively. We expect product development expenses, of which a portion will be capitalized, to continue in the foreseeable future, as we pursue opportunities to invest in developing new products and internal tools and enhance the functionality of our existing products and technologies. 
 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by 3.0 million, or 3 , to 112.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by an increase in professional fees associated with the acquisitions of Envato and Backgrid, and increase in employee-related costs driven by the the acquisition of Envato. This was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense, and a decrease in Shutterstock-legacy employee-related costs. In addition, there was a 0.3 million increase and a 1.5 million decrease from recurring and non-recurring Giphy Retention Compensation expenses, respectively. General and Administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes 8.2 million of transaction costs for the Backgrid and Envato acquisitions. 
 Bargain Purchase Gain . In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a bargain purchase gain of 51.8 million related to the acquisition of Giphy, which represents the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in addition to the net negative purchase price. 
 Interest Expense . In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we recognized interest expense of 5.6 million and 1.3 million, respectively related to our credit facility and the amortization of deferred financing fees. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to borrowings under the A R Credit Agreement entered into during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to fund the acquisition of Envato. 
 Other Income, Net. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income, net substantially consisted of 3.5 million of interest income and 1.7 million of unrealized gains related to our investment in Meitu, Inc., partially offset by 0.7 million of unrealized foreign currency losses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 other income, net consisted of 0.9 million of unrealized foreign currency gains and 2.7 million of interest income. As we increase the volume of business transacted in foreign currencies resulting from international expansion and as currency rates fluctuate, we expect foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate. 
 Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased by 8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Our effective tax rates yielded an expense of 31.4 and 7.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net effect of discrete items increased the effective tax rate by 8.2 . The discrete items for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relate to shortfalls on equity award vestings and a one-time charge of 6.3 million related to the reversal of a deferred tax asset resulting from the expiration of equity awards granted to the Company s Founder and Executive Chairman, partially offset by the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits of 7.3 million due to the settlement of an IRS audit. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate would have been 23.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net effect of discrete items decreased the effective tax rate by 8.9 . The discrete items for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relate to the non-taxable bargain purchase gain associated with the acquisition of Giphy and the effect of the U.S. Research and Development R D tax credit claimed on the Company s 2022 tax return, which was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate would have been 16.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As we continue to expand our operations outside of the United States, we have been and may continue to become subject to taxation in additional non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.

 Quarterly Trends 
 Our operating results have in the past fluctuated from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including the effects of some seasonal trends in customer behavior, timing of acquisitions and the timing of revenue recognition associated with data deal partnerships. For example, for the Content business, we expect that certain customers usage may decrease at times during the third quarter of each calendar year due to the summer vacation season and may increase at times during the fourth quarter of each calendar year as demand is generally higher to support marketing campaigns in advance of the fourth quarter holiday season. While we believe seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results, our growth trajectory may have overshadowed these effects to date. 
 In addition, expenditures on content by customers tend to be discretionary in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions, the economic prospects of specific industries, budgeting constraints, buying patterns and a variety of other factors, many of which are outside our control. As a result of these and other factors, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indicators of our future operating performance. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 131.4 million which consisted primarily of bank balances. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows generated from operations. In addition, if necessary, we have the ability to draw on our A R Credit Agreement dated July 22, 2024. 
 Historically, our principal uses of cash have included funding our operations, capital expenditures, and content acquisitions. In addition, our capital allocation strategies also include funding business combinations and asset acquisitions that enhance our strategic position, cash dividend payments, principle and interest payments under our credit facilities and share purchases under our share repurchase programs. We plan to finance our operations, capital expenditures and corporate actions largely through cash generated by our operations and our credit facility. Since our results of operations are sensitive to the level of competition we face, increased competition could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. 
 Dividends 
 We declared and paid cash dividends of 0.90 per share of common stock, or 31.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 On October 21, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.30 per share of outstanding common stock payable on December 13, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 29, 2024. Future declarations of dividends are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors, and will depend on, among other things, our future financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, contractual restrictions, anticipated cash needs, business prospects, provisions of applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In June 2023, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the 2023 Share Repurchase Program ), providing authorization to repurchase up to 100 million of our common stock. 
 We expect to fund future repurchases, if any, through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and future financing transactions, if appropriate. Accordingly, our 2023 Share Repurchase Program is subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Under the share repurchase program, management is authorized to purchase shares of our common stock from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares of our common stock under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program at an average per-share cost of 48.86. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 594,400 and 1,111,500 shares of our common stock at an average cost of 35.33 and 37.42, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately 351,000 and 431,000 shares of common stock at an average cost of 42.75 and 44.06, respectively, under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, we had 30 million of remaining authorization for repurchases under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program.

 Credit Facility and A R Credit Agreement 
 On May 6, 2022, we entered into a five-year 100 million unsecured revolving loan facility (the Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and other lenders. The Credit Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility and a swingline facility and it also permitted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, up to 100 million of additional revolving loan commitments with the consent of the Administrative Agent. 
 On July 22, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the A R Credit Agreement ), which was entered into among us, as borrower, certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of our as guarantors, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent for the lenders. The A R Credit Agreement provides for a five-year (i) senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount 125 million and (ii) senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver in an aggregate principal amount of 250 million. The A R Credit Agreement provides for a letter of credit subfacility and a swingline facility. 
 At our option, loans under the A R Credit Agreement accrue interest at a per annum rate based on either (i) the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.375 to 0.750 , determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (for interest periods of 1, 3 or 6 months) plus a margin ranging from 1.375 to 1.750 , determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio, plus a credit spread of 0.100 . We are also required to pay an unused commitment fee ranging from 0.175 to 0.250 , determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio. In connection with the execution of this agreement, we paid debt issuance costs of approximately 2.2 million. 
 The A R Credit Agreement replaces our existing Credit Facility, which was fully repaid and terminated upon the effectiveness of the A R Credit Agreement. In connection with the closing of the Credit Facility, we repaid 30 million of existing outstanding borrowings and accrued interest. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a remaining borrowing capacity of 94 million, net of standby letters of credit. 
 The A R Credit Agreement contains financial covenants and requirements restricting certain of our activities, which are customary for this type of credit facility. We are also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio, in each case, determined in accordance with the terms of the A R Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
 Our outstanding debt (in thousands) is reflected in the table below. We classify the Revolver as a current liability since we could draw upon and repay the outstanding amount as needed. The maturity of the Revolver is in 2029. 
 Our debt consists of the following (in thousands): 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Current Debt: Revolver - Credit Facility 30,000 Revolver - A R Credit Agreement 155,000 Term Loan - A R Credit Agreement 3,834 Non-Current Debt: Term Loan - A R Credit Agreement 120,392 
 
 Based on Level 2 inputs, the carrying value of our debt approximates its fair value, as borrowings are subject to variable interest rates that adjust with changes in market rates and market conditions and the current interest rate approximates that which would be available under similar financial arrangements. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized interest expense of 4.5 million and 5.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, unamortized debt issuance cost related to the Term Loan - A R Credit Agreement is 0.8 million.

 We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our cash and cash equivalents, and cash from operations, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. Future capital expenditures will generally relate to the functionality of our current platform, the acquisition of additional storage, servers, network connectivity hardware, security apparatus and software, leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures related to office expansion and relocation, content and general corporate infrastructure.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 55 million in unconditional cash obligations, consisting primarily of purchase obligations related to contracts for cloud-based services, infrastructure and other business services as well as minimum royalty guarantees in connection with certain content licenses, of which the majority is due to be paid within the next two years. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 40 million in operating lease obligations with lease payments extending through 2029. 
 See Note 14 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding our existing capital commitments as of September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow data for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 24,680 106,603 Net cash used in investing activities (156,120) (61,915) Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities 162,556 (83,234) 
 Operating Activities 
 Our primary source of cash from operating activities is cash collections from our customers. The majority of our revenue is generated from credit card transactions and is typically settled within one to five business days. Our primary uses of cash for operating activities are for the payment of royalties to content contributors, employee-related expenditures and the payment of other operating expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 24.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Net cash provided by operating activities of 106.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating cash flows included a 28.7 million increase in the recurring and non-recurring payments made to the Giphy workforce, the reimbursement of which is reflected in Investing Activities on the Statement of Cash Flows. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating cash flows included 45.7 million of cash outflows made for the Envato Seller Obligations. 
 In addition, operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were favorably impacted from an increase in operating income and changes in the timing of cash collections from data deal customers and payments pertaining to operating expenses, which can cause operating cash flow to fluctuate from period to period. In addition, operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were unfavorably impacted by the recurring and non-recurring payments made to the Giphy workforce, the reimbursement of which is reflected in Investing Activities on the Statement of Cash Flows. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 156.1 million, consisting primarily of (i) 179.1 million used in the acquisition of Envato and Backgrid, net of cash acquired; (ii) capital expenditures of 38.3 million for internal-use software and website development costs and purchases of software and equipment; and (iii) 2.5 million paid to acquire the rights to distribute certain digital content into perpetuity. These cash outflows were partially offset by 63.4 million of Giphy Retention Compensation, as reimbursed by the Giphy seller. 
 Cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 61.9 million, consisting primarily of (i) 53.7 million used in the acquisition of Giphy, net of cash acquired, (ii) capital expenditures of 34.7 million for internal-use software and website development costs and purchases of software and equipment, and (iii) 9.7 million paid to acquire the rights to distribute certain digital content in perpetuity. These cash outflows were partially offset by (i) 34.7 million of Giphy Retention Compensation, as reimbursed by the Giphy seller. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 162.6 million, consisting of (i) 280.0 million received from our A R Credit Agreement; (ii) 30.0 million used for the repayment of our Credit Facility; (iii) 31.9 million, related to the payment of the quarterly cash dividend; (vi) 41.6 million paid in connection with the repurchase of common stock under our 2023 Share Repurchase Program; (v) 11.7 million paid in the settlement of tax withholding obligations related to employee stock-based compensation awards; and (vi) 2.2 million paid for debt issuance costs.

Table of Contents 

 Cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 83.2 million, consisting of (i) 50.0 million used for the repayment of our Credit Facility; (ii) 29.0 million related to the payment of the quarterly cash dividend; (iii) 19.0 million paid in connection with the repurchase of common stock under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program; and (iv) 15.2 million paid in settlement of tax withholding obligations related to employee stock-based compensation awards. These amounts were partially offset by 30.0 million proceeds received from our Credit Facility. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, our management considers certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, collectively referred to as non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted common share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, revenue growth (including by product offering) on a constant currency basis (expressed as a percentage), and adjusted free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are included solely to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results and are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Non-GAAP Financial Measures (in thousands): Adjusted net income 46,351 45,549 115,369 131,741 Adjusted EBITDA 69,997 64,690 188,046 194,509 Adjusted free cash flow 45,672 12,651 93,102 96,870 Revenue growth on a constant currency basis 7 12 4 7 
 
 These non-GAAP financial measures have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP, should be considered only in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures. In addition, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted common share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, revenue growth (including by product offering) on a constant currency basis (expressed as a percentage) and adjusted free cash flow should not be construed as indicators of our operating performance, liquidity or cash flows generated by operating, investing and financing activities, as there may be significant factors or trends that they fail to address. We caution investors that non-GAAP financial information, by its nature, departs from traditional accounting conventions; accordingly, its use can make it difficult to compare our current results with our results from other reporting periods and with the results of other companies. 
 Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, as an integral part of managing the business and to, among other things: (i) monitor and evaluate the performance of our business operations, financial performance and overall liquidity; (ii) facilitate management s internal comparisons of the historical operating performance of its business operations; (iii) facilitate management s external comparisons of the results of its overall business to the historical operating performance of other companies that may have different capital structures and debt levels; (iv) review and assess the operating performance of our management team and, together with other operational objectives, as a measure in evaluating employee compensation; (v) analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments; and (vi) plan for and prepare future annual operating budgets and determine appropriate levels of operating investments. 
 Management believes that adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted common share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, revenue growth (including by product offering) on a constant currency basis (expressed as a percentage) and adjusted free cash flow are useful to investors because these measures enable investors to analyze Shutterstock s operating results on the same basis as that used by management. Additionally, management believes that adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted common share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors about the performance of the Company s overall business because such measures eliminate the effects of unusual or other infrequent charges that are not directly attributable to Shutterstock s underlying operating performance and revenue growth (including by product offering) on a constant currency basis (expressed as a percentage), provides useful information to investors by eliminating the effect of foreign currency fluctuations that are not directly attributable to Shutterstock s operating performance. Management also believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the comparability for investors in assessing Shutterstock s financial reporting. Management believes that adjusted free cash flow is useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for strategic measures, after making necessary capital investments in internal-use software and website development costs to

 support the Company s ongoing business operations and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions. 
 Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, as the excluded items may have significant effects on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, our methods for measuring non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies similarly titled measures. When evaluating our performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income and our other GAAP results. 
 Our method for calculating adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted common share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, revenue growth (including by product offering) on a constant currency basis (expressed as a percentage) and adjusted free cash flow, as well as a reconciliation of the differences between each of our non-GAAP financial measures (adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, revenue growth (including by product offering) on a constant currency basis (expressed as a percentage) and adjusted free cash flow), and each measure s most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is presented below. 
 The expense associated with the Giphy Retention Compensation related to (i) the one-time employment inducement bonuses and (ii) the vesting of the cash value of unvested Meta equity awards held by the employees prior to closing, which are reflected in operating expenses (together, the Giphy Retention Compensation Expense - non-recurring ), are required payments in accordance with the terms of the acquisition. Meta s sale of Giphy was directed by the CMA and accordingly, the terms of the acquisition were subject to CMA preapproval. Management considers the operating expense associated with these required payments to be unusual and non-recurring in nature. The Giphy Retention Compensation Expense - non-recurring is not considered ongoing expense necessary to operate the Company s business. Therefore, such expenses have been included in the below adjustments for calculating adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted common share. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company also incurred 4.5 million, of Giphy Retention Compensation expense related to recurring employee costs, which is included in operating expenses, and are not included in the below adjustments for calculating adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted common share.

 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Diluted Common Share 
 We define adjusted net income as net income adjusted for the impact of non-cash equity-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, Giphy Retention Compensation Expense - non-recurring, unrealized gains and losses on investments, severance costs associated with strategic workforce optimizations, and the estimated tax impact of such adjustments. We define adjusted net income per diluted common share as adjusted net income divided by weighted average diluted shares.

The performance-based metrics were not met, the awards were not exercisable, and the Company recognized a non-cash tax expense for the change in deferred taxes. 
 (3) Of these amounts, 7.8 million and 8.1 million are included in cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 24.1 million and 23.4 million are included in cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including risks related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation, interest rate fluctuation and inflation. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our sales to international customers are denominated in multiple currencies, including but not limited to the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen. Revenue denominated in foreign currencies as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 27 and 29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in exchange rates will affect our revenue and certain operating expenses to the extent that our revenue is generated and expenses are incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Royalties earned by and paid to contributors are denominated in the U.S. dollar and will not be affected by changes in exchange rates. Based on our foreign currency denominated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we estimate that a 10 change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against all foreign currency denominated revenues would result in an approximately 3 impact on our revenue. 
 We have established foreign subsidiaries in various countries and have concluded that the functional currency of these entities is generally the local currency. Business transacted in currencies other than each entity s functional currency results in transactional gains and losses. Translation adjustments resulting from converting the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. We do not currently enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in order to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk, but we may do so in the future.

 (1) Includes no single currency which exceeded 5 of total revenue for any of the periods presented. 
 Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk 
 Our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market accounts. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents is not particularly sensitive to interest rate changes. 
 Amounts borrowed under the A R Credit Agreement accrue interest at a per annum rate based on either (i) the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.375 to 0.750 , determined based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio or (ii) the Term SOFR rate (for interest periods of 1, 3 or 6 months) plus a margin ranging from 1.375 to 1.750 , determined based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio, plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.100 . A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our interest expense as of September 30, 2024. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objective. 
 On July 22, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of Envato Pty Ltd. Envato ). Management is currently integrating Envato into our operations and internal control processes and, pursuant to the SEC s guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of an assessment in the year of acquisition, the Company is excluding the internal control over financial reporting of Envato from its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, and subject to the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As mentioned above, the Company completed its acquisition of Envato on July 22, 2024. The Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of Envato and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as it integrates Envato into the Company s overall internal control over financial reporting process.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Although we are not currently a party to any material pending litigation, from time to time, third parties assert claims against us regarding intellectual property rights, employment matters, privacy issues and other matters arising during the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation or the disposition of any claims, nor the amount of damages and exposure, if any, that we could incur, we currently believe that the final disposition of all existing matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to periodic threats of lawsuits, investigations and claims. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
