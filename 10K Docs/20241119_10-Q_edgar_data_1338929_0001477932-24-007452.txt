Maybacks serves over 40 markets with its own proprietary programming. Within the 43 cities Maybacks serve are major markets such as NYC, Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami, Houston and Phoenix to name a few. Maybacks completed the development of a multi-platform phone application app in May of 2024 known as iDreamCTV. The app allows the user access to all 30 Maybacks streaming channels as opposed to just the limited channels broadcasted at the local level at scheduled times via OTA or Over the Air. The app is available on ROKU, iOS and Android platforms and launched in June of 2024 with 25,000 initial downloads. To date the active users of the app are 91,000. In addition, Maybacks has signed a co-marketing agreement with ZEASN Whale TV. Whale TV is an operating system OS manufacturer with its OS being utilized by over 400 TV manufacturers globally. Whale TV and Maybacks will market the iDreamCTV app and will look to generate ad revenue through digital ads known as Vast Tags. Maybacks and Whale TV will split the revenue on a 70/30 basis to Maybacks favor. The relationship with Whale TV gives Maybacks access to a global market including China, India, SE Asia, Australia, South America and Western Europe, which will all serve as potential opportunities for Maybacks and Whale TV to create Vast Tag revenue. There are many Over the Air and platform driven television networks with greater financial resources and experience in running, such as Sling TV, which is owned by DISH Network, as well as many other independent networks. We plan to compete with many firms, including corporations with large divisions, many of these companies have greater financial, technical or marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition or larger customer bases than we do and are able to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can. There are no assurances that we will be able to compete against these larger rivals and gain market share. We have realized revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we hope more advertising agreements are signed and more ad impressions are sold to generate future revenue for our company. While these are signs that progress in our company has been made, we are not profitable and still face several challenges, including those presented as Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On June 20, 2023, the Company closed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Agreement with Goliath Motion Picture Promotions owned by Priscella Cooper (the Seller ). On the Closing Date, pursuant to the Asset Agreement, the Company acquired various full-length motion pictures and serial television shows (the Assets ). Since execution, however, the fulfillment of the Asset Agreement has not been possible because the Assets could not be entirely conveyed to the Company as intended by the parties. Therefore, on May 10, 2024, the parties entered into an Amended Asset Purchase Agreement, to be effective as of December 31, 2023, to convert the purchase of Assets to a license to use those Assets for a period of 10 years. As a result of the license of the Assets, the Company is in the process of uploading the 35,000 plus full-length motion pictures and serial television shows to create a VOD, Video on Demand opportunity to be driven by subscription and/or Vast Tag ad revenue. The Company is currently using the non-tokenized library for content distribution on its own TV Network known as Maybacks. 22 Table of Contents The Company intends to fund operations through increased sales and debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements, until the Company generates positive cash flow from operations. However, the Company has an accumulated deficit of 38,467,655 and 38,038,768 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, incurred net losses of 428,887 and 719,901 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and had net working capital deficits of 4,747,353 and 4,998,581 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and had minimal cash resources. The company has several promissory notes in default, including convertible notes with face values of 1,051,664, secured promissory notes with face values of 117,250, related party promissory notes with face values of 484,974 and self-liquidating promissory notes of 132,083. These factors raise doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within the next year. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern depends on its ability to repay or settle its current indebtedness, generate positive cash flow, and raise capital through equity and debt financing or other means on favorable terms. If the Company cannot obtain additional funds when required or on favorable terms, management may be necessary to restructure the Company or cease operations. Our address is 50 Division Street Suite 500, Somerset NJ 08873. Our corporate website is http://globalfibertechnologies.com/. The Company has never declared bankruptcy or been in receivership. The Company has earned minimal revenues and has minimal cash on hand. The Company has sustained losses since inception and has primarily relied upon the sale of its securities and loans from related parties and outside parties for funding. Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Revenue We earned revenue of 97,096 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with no revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We earned revenue of 164,668 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We expect that revenue will increase in future quarters as Maybacks continues to enter into agreements to expand the markets for its movie and TV programming and agreements for advertising spots. We also expect that revenue will increase in future quarters as we are currently re-building a more fortified, secure, and user-friendly platform for storing and claiming our future NFTs. We have completed the building of a landing platform on top of our current NFT platform. One of the platform s purposes is to help NFT investors recapture the losses incurred on certain types of projects known as Rug Pulls . We expect it should create substantial opportunities for us and give us credibility in the Blockchain and NFT community. We will also look to monetize the exclusive license we have with Maestro Entertainment on 10,000 Master Recordings by creating Music NFTS and Vinyl Records. Operating Expenses Operating expenses increased from 84,654 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 222,366 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Operating expenses increased from 348,816 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 674,092 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Overall, this increase resulted primarily from the amortization of license agreements we entered with Goliath, and to a lesser extent from our efforts to acquire Maybacks and the assets of Goliath, and to build out our organization to establish a strong base for current and future growth. The detail of expenditures by major category is reflected in the table below. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 General and Administrative 194,260 160,423 Depreciation and Amortization 398,810 36,236 Professional and Legal Fees 80,005 97,298 Research and Development 1,017 54,858 Total Operating Expense 674,092 348,816 23 Table of Contents Operating expenses increased in the amount of 325,276 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses increased by 33,837 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization increased by 362,573 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the amortization of the license agreements of Maybacks and Goliath, which were acquired in 2023. Professional and legal fees decreased by 17,293 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the acquisition and license agreement we consummated in 2023. Research and development decreased by 53,841, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the development of the blockchain and NFT platform service product lines during the first quarter of 2023. Other Income (Expenses) Other expenses were 193,048 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expenses of 635,247 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, both primarily as a result from the loss in the valuation of derivative liabilities, loss on the settlement of notes and interest expense. Other income was 81,664 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expenses of 598,553 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, both primarily as a result of income or expenses from the gain or loss in the valuation of derivative liabilities and interest expense Net Income (Loss) We recorded a net loss of 360,993 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 719,901 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded a net loss of 512,854 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 947,369 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since our inception, we have financed our operations through private placements, convertible notes, and unsecured debt, and we have recently issued debt in our company secured by all of our assets. Our current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets above contains, at September 30, 2024, certain of this debt that is in default, including, convertible notes with face values of 1,051,664, secured promissory notes with face values of 101,550, related party promissory notes with face values of 484,974 and self-liquidating promissory notes of 132,083. At September 30, 2024, we have no cash, a substantial working capital deficit, our revenues have only commenced in 2024 and future losses are anticipated. Additionally, we expect to experience higher interest payments in the future as a result of our outstanding liabilities. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues and/or additional financing to service this debt, there is a risk the lenders will call the notes and we will be unable to repay the loans. If this happens, we could go out of business. 24 Table of Contents Based upon the current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months. We intend to fund operations through increased sales and debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements. We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired and we could go out of business. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The following is a summary of the cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Change Cash and cash equivalents 125 - 125 100 Summary of Cash Flows Below is a summary of the Company s cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For the Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (139,049 (271,486 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities - - Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 139,174 272,049 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 125 563 Operating activities Net cash used in operating activities was 139,049 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted of the net loss of 512,854 and a 385,011 change in the fair value of derivative liabilities, mainly offset by the amortization of intangible assets of 377,089, accounts payable and accrued expenses of 99,593 and accrued interest of 157,380. Net cash used in operating activities was 271,486 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted of the net loss of 947,369 offset by the non-cash items for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of 348,623 change in change in fair value of derivative liabilities offset by the gain on derivative liabilities due to conversion of note payable, 46,153 in extinguishment of derivative liabilities, and a 36,236 in depreciation and amortization expenses. Investing Activities The Company did not use any funds for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 25 Table of Contents Financing activities Net cash provided in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 149,174 and 272,049, respectively, consisting of the following: Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Bank overdraft (1,501 (306 Advances from related parties 14,831 27,913 Proceeds from common stock and warrants 119,030 - Proceeds from promissory Notes - 116,785 Proceeds from secured promissory notes 88,200 - Proceeds from convertible notes 105,000 - Proceeds from unsecured loans - 127,657 Proceeds from self liquidating notes - - Repayments of advances from related parties (90,336 - Repayment of promissory Notes (42,500 - Repayment of convertible notes (53,250 - Net cash provided by financing activities 139,174 272,049 Going Concern The financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. We have incurred losses since inception, resulting in an accumulated deficit of 38,551,622 and a working capital deficit of 4,728,182 as of September 30, 2024, and future losses are anticipated. The company has a number of promissory notes in default, including convertible notes with face values of 1,051,664, secured promissory notes with face values of 101,250, related party promissory notes with face values of 484,974 and self-liquidating promissory notes of 132,083. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of our company to continue our operations as a going concern is dependent on our ability to repay or settle current indebtedness, generate positive cash flow, and raise capital through equity and debt financing or other means on favorable terms. If the Company cannot obtain additional funds when required or on favorable terms, management may be necessary to restructure the Company or cease operations. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are a development stage company and have only recently generated revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including high debt, limited capital resources and competition from larger organizations. We will require equity and/or debt financing to provide for the capital required to implement our plans. We will require additional funds to operate for the next year. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 26 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make specific estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and decisions on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes are important when preparing financial statements. The actual results could differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material. Due to the need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters, materially different amounts could be reported under other conditions or using different assumptions. We regularly review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in preparing our financial statements. Please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as this Annual Report includes disclosures regarding the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include common stock valuation and options issued as stock-based compensation. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from its customer contracts following ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract. Revenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps: 1. Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer. 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 3. Determine the transaction price. 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 5. Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Leases Effective October 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (the FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASU 2016-02 ), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the new leases standard ), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing critical information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new lease standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. There were no long-term operating lease contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that require access to (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based awards at fair value on the grant date and recognize compensation over the service period they are expected to vest. Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants. The estimated value of the portion of a stock-based award that is ultimately expected to vest, considering estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of other comparative securities, equal to the weighted average life of the options. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures, such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred 0 and 0 for stock-based compensation, respectively. 27 Table of Contents Fair Value FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure s ASC 820 establishes a framework for all fair value measurements and expands disclosures related to fair value measurement and developments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1 Quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs; Level 2 Significant other observable inputs that observable market data can corroborate; and Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs that observable market data cannot corroborate. The Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. It determined that the convertible notes should be classified as a liability since the conversion option becomes effective at issuance, resulting in no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion options. The Company accounts for convertible notes and warrants as derivative liabilities due to there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of all conversion options. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are not required to provide the information required by this Item because we are a smaller reporting company. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 28 Table of Contents As required by the SEC Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below. 1. We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 2. We have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on a timely basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact of the lack of timely communication between non financial personnel and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness. To address these material weaknesses, management engaged financial consultants, performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. We have not remedied the material weaknesses as of September 30, 2024. The Company plans to take remedial action to address these weaknesses during the fiscal year ended 2024. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except the implementation of the controls identified above. 29 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, our company is party to three pending litigation matters. One matter is entitled Randazzo LLC v. Avani Holdings LLC Global Fashion Technologies, Inc. This litigation was initiated by the plaintiff in order to evict Avani Holdings LLC from its rented premises in California and to recover unpaid rent. the company does not operate out of the premises in question and has never signed any leases or other documents with the plaintiff. A judgment of eviction was entered, but the company does not operate out of the premises in question and therefore did not appear in the matter to oppose the judgment of eviction. The plaintiff is also seeking unpaid rent in the amount of 26,595. The second matter is entitled Patricia Witthuhn v. Global Fashion Technologies, Inc. This litigation was initiated by the plaintiff in order to collect wages allegedly due pursuant to her employment with Avani Holdings LLC. The Company never hired Ms. Witthuhn and never acquired Avani Holdings, LLC. Consequently, there is no legitimate cause of action against the Company. However, due to cash flow constraints, the Company is unable to hire outside counsel for this litigation. The amount being sought by the plaintiff is approximately 15,000. The third matter is entitled William Corso v. Global Fashion Technologies, Inc. This litigation was initiated by the plaintiff in order to collect wages allegedly due pursuant to his employment with Avani Holdings LLC. The Company never hired Mr. Corso and never acquired Avani Holdings, LLC. Consequently, there is no legitimate cause of action against the Company. However, due to cash flow constraints, the Company is unable to hire outside counsel for this litigation. The amount being sought by the plaintiff is approximately 40,000. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business faces many risks, a number of which are described in the section captioned Risk Factors in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on June 12, 2024 and in our Quarterly Report for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on August 1, 2024. The risks described may not be the only risks we face. Other risks of which we are not yet aware, or that we currently believe are not material, may also materially and adversely impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in the risk factors contained in our Annual Report or Quarterly Report occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted and the value of an investment in our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the risks described in our Annual Report and Quarterly Reports, and the information contained in the section captioned Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report before deciding whether to invest in our securities. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued common shares as follows: The Company issued 3,620 shares of Series Z preferred shares for net proceeds of 90,480. The Company issued 215,653,484 shares for conversion of notes valued at 161,336. These securities were issued pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 promulgated thereunder. The holders represented their intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view towards distribution. The investors were given adequate information about us to make an informed investment decision. We did not engage in any general solicitation or advertising. We directed our transfer agent to issue the stock certificates with the appropriate restrictive legend affixed to the restricted stock in instances where a restrictive legend was required. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities Our current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets above contains, at September 30, 2024, certain debt that is in default, including convertible notes with face values of 1,051,664, secured promissory notes with face values of 117,250, related party promissory notes with face values of 484,974 and self-liquidating promissory notes of 132,083. At September 30, 2024, we had insufficient cash on hand to repay these notes. None of these notes have been paid, and management has indicated that no demand for payment for any of these notes has been received by us as of the date of this report. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues and/or additional financing to service this debt, there is a risk the lenders will call the notes, secure our assets, as to those applicable secured notes, and demand payment. If this happens, we could go out of business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures N/A Item 5. Other Information None. 30 Table of Contents Item 6.
