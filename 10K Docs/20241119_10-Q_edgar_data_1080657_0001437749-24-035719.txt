CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in this report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Forward-looking statements relate to matters such as our industry, business strategy, goals and expectations concerning our market position, future operations, margins, profitability, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity, capital resources, cash flows, results of operations and other financial and operating information. Forward-looking statements included in this report include, but are not limited to, statements regarding purchases and sales of properties, plans for financing and refinancing our properties, the adequacy of our capital resources, changes to the markets in which we operate, our business plans and strategies, and our payment of dividends. When used in this report, the words "will," "may," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "expect," "should," "project," "plan," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from projections include, but are not limited to: 

inherent risks associated with real estate investments and with the real estate industry; 

significant competition may decrease or prevent increases in our properties' occupancy and rental rates and may reduce the value of our properties; 

a decrease in demand for commercial space and/or an increase in operating costs; 

failure by any major tenant (or a substantial number of tenants) to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of their financial condition, an early termination of their lease, a non-renewal of their lease or a renewal of their lease on terms less favorable to us; 

challenging economic conditions facing us and our tenants may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; 

our failure to generate sufficient cash to service and/or retire our debt obligations in a timely manner; 

our inability to borrow or raise sufficient capital to maintain and/or expand our real estate investment portfolio; 

adverse changes in the real estate financing markets, including potential increases in interest rates and/or borrowing costs; 

potential losses, including from adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and title claims, may not be covered by insurance; 

inability to complete acquisitions or dispositions and, even if these transactions are completed, failure to successfully operate acquired properties and/or sell properties without incurring significant defeasance costs; 

our reliance on third-party property managers to manage a substantial number of our properties, brokers and/or agents to lease our properties; 

3

Table of Contents 

decrease in supply and/or demand for single family homes, inability to acquire additional model homes and increased competition to buy such properties; 

terrorist attacks or actions and/or risks relating to information technology and cybersecurity attacks, loss of confidential information and other related business disruptions; 

failure to continue to qualify as a REIT; 

adverse results of any legal proceedings; 

changes in laws, rules and regulations affecting our business; 

the possibility that if any of the banking institutions in which we deposit funds ultimately fails, we may lose any amounts of our deposits over federally insured levels which could reduce the amount of cash we have available to distribute or invest and could result in a decline in our value. 

the possibility that we may not comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market ("Nasdaq"), which may result in our common stock being delisted, which could affect our common stock's market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital; 

actions of activist stockholders may cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business; and 

the other risks and uncertainties discussed in Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024 .

Presidio Property Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
 September 30, 2024 

commercial properties in fee interest, two of which we own as a partial interest in various affiliates, in which we serve as general partner, member and/or manager, and a special purpose acquisition company (until deconsolidation in September 2023) as noted below. 
 
 The Company or one of its affiliates operates the following partnerships during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements: 
 
 The Company is the sole general partner and limited partner in two limited partnerships (NetREIT Palm Self-Storage LP and NetREIT Casa Grande LP), both of which, at September 30, 2024 , had ownership interests in an entity that owns income producing real estate. The Company refers to these entities collectively as the "NetREIT Partnerships". 
 
 The Company is the general and limited partner in limited partnerships that purchase model homes and lease them back to homebuilders as commercial tenants (Dubose Model Home Investors #202, LP, Dubose Model Home Investors #203, LP, Dubose Model Home Investors #204, LP, Dubose Model Home Investors #205, LP, Dubose Model Home Investors #206, LP, and Dubose Model Home Investors #207, LP). The Company refers to these entities collectively as the "Model Home Partnerships". 

The Company has determined that the limited partnerships in which it owns less than 100 should be included in the Company's consolidated financial statements as the Company directs their activities and has control of such limited partnerships. 
 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for federal income tax purposes. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels, and diversity of stock ownership. Provided we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate-level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders that we derive from our REIT qualifying activities. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, all our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax. We are subject to certain state and local income taxes. 
 
 We, together with one of our entities, have elected to treat certain subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary (a "TRS") for federal income tax purposes. Certain activities that we undertake must be conducted by a TRS, such as non-customary services for our commercial tenants, and holding assets that we cannot hold directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. The Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in its financial statements. Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have been assessed any significant interest or penalties for tax positions by any tax jurisdictions. 
 
 Liquidity. The Company's anticipated future sources of liquidity may include existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, refinancing of existing mortgages, future real estate sales, new borrowings, and the sale of equity or debt securities. Future capital needs include paying down existing borrowings, maintaining our existing properties, funding tenant improvements on our commercial buildings, paying lease commissions (to the extent they are not covered by lender-held reserve deposits), and the payment of dividends to our stockholders. The Company is also seeking investments that are likely to produce income and achieve long-term gains in order to pay dividends to our stockholders. To ensure that we can effectively execute these objectives, we routinely review our liquidity requirements and continually evaluate all potential sources of liquidity. I f necessary, the Company may seek other short-term liquidity alternatives, such as bridge loans, refinancing property loans or a bank line of credit depending on the credit environment. See note 11 Stockholders' Equity for additional information on sale of securities. 

Short-term liquidity needs include paying our current operating costs, satisfying the debt service requirements of existing mortgages, completing ten ant improvements o n our commercial buildings, paying leasing commissions, distributions to non controlling interests, and funding dividends, if any, to stockholders. Future principal payments due on mortgage notes payables, during 2024 and 2025 total approximately million and million, respectively, of which million in 2024 and million in 2025 are related to model home properties. See Note 7. Mortgage Notes Payable for additional information on t he Dakota Center loan that matured on July 6, 2024. Management expects certain model home properties can be sold, and that the underlying mortgage notes will be paid off with sales proceeds while other mortgage notes can be refinanced, as the Company has historically been able to do in the past with all model home properties. Additional principal payments will be made with cash flows from ongoing operations. 
 
 As the Company continues its operations, it may re-finance or seek additional financing. However, there can be no assurance that any such re-financing or additional financing will be available to the Company on acceptable terms, if at all. If events or circumstances occur such that the Company does not obtain additional funding, it will most likely be required to reduce its plans and/or certain discretionary spending, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to achieve its intended business objectives. Management believes that the combination of working capital on hand and the ability to refinance commercial and model home mortgages will fund operations through at least the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of these unaudited interim financial statements. 
 
 The Company served as the sponsor of the former special purpose acquisition company Murphy Canyon Acquisition Corp. ("Murphy Canyon" or the "SPAC") since its creation in October 2021 and certain officers and directors of the Company also served as officers and directors of the SPAC. On September 22, 2023, Murphy Canyon completed its business combination with Conduit Pharmaceuticals Limited ("Conduit Pharma") and changed its name to Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("Conduit"). Immediately prior to the business combination, the Company owned approximately of the SPAC's outstanding common stock. Upon consummation of the business combination, the SPAC's shares of Class B common stock were converted into shares of its Class A common stock and the shares of Class A common stock were then reclassified as a single class of Conduit common stock. As a result of the business combination, the Company was issued (i) shares of Conduit's common stock due to the conversion of the shares of the SPAC's Class B common stock into shares of the SPAC's Class A common stock and then reclassification into shares of Conduit common stock, (ii) shares of Conduit common stock, which prior to the business combination were shares of the SPAC's Class A common stock and (iii) private warrants to purchase shares of Conduit common stock, which prior to the business combination were warrants to purchase shares of the SPAC's Class A common stock. Also in the business combination, shareholders and debtholders of Conduit Pharma were issued shares of Conduit common stock. Immediately following the consummation of the business combination, the Company transferred shares of Conduit common stock and warrants to purchase shares of Conduit common stock to the SPAC's independent directors as compensation for their services. As a result, the Company owned approximately of Conduit following the consummation of the business combination. In connection with the business combination, the Company's officers and directors who also served as officers and directors of the SPAC resigned from the SPAC, with the exception of the Company's former Chief Financial Officer who resigned from the Company. See Note 9. Investment in Conduit Pharmaceuticals for additional information. 

equity ownership stake, the overlap of three of our executive officers as executive officers of Murphy Canyon, and significant influence that we exercised over the funding and acquisition of new operations for an initial business combination (see Note 2, Variable Interest Entity). All intercompany balances, prior to deconsolidation and loss of control on September 22, 2023, have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 The Company classifies the noncontrolling interests in the NetREIT Partnerships as part of consolid ated net (loss) in come in 2024 and 2023 and has i ncluded the accumulated amount of noncontrolling interests as part of equity since inception in February 2010. If a change in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary results in loss of control and deconsolidation, any retained ownership interest will be remeasured, with the gain or loss reported in the consolidated statements of operations.

 The value of in-place leases and unamortized lease origination costs a re amortized to expenses over the remaining term of the respe ctive leases, which range fro m less than a year to ten years. The amount allocated to acquired in-place leases is determined based on management s assessment of lost revenue and costs incurred for the period required to lease the assum ed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased. 

The amount allocated to unamortized lease origination costs is determined by what the Company would have paid to a third -party to secure a new tenant reduced by the expired term of the respective lease. The amount allocated to tenant relationships is the benefit resulting from the likelihood of a tenant renewing its lease. Amortization expense related to these assets was approximately and during each period for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

The total impairment chargers on model homes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately and , respectively. The builder changed their product style in the neighborhoods where these model homes are located, in Texas, after we had purchased the homes.

As noted below in footnote 3 - Recent Real Estate Transactions , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we sold model homes for approximately million, net of sales costs, and the Company recognized a net gain of approximately million. The Company did not recognize a non-cash impairment to our real estate assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 The Dakota Center property impairment of approximately million, is related to the maturing of our non-recourse real estate loan in July 2024 and the Company not being able to come to an agreement with the current lender on a modification or extension. In October 2024, we and the lender agreed to offer the property for sale with net proceeds being applied to pay off the loan balance, accrued interest and fees.

Following the completion of the Murphy Canyon IPO in January 2022, we determined that Murphy Canyon was a VIE in which we had a variable interest because we participated in its formation and design, manage the significant activities, and Murphy Canyon did not have enough equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We have also determined that Murphy Canyon's public stockholders did not have substantive rights, and their equity interest constituted temporary equity, outside of permanent equity, in accordance with ASC 480 - 10 - S99 - 3A. As such, we have concluded that, prior to the business combination, we were the primary beneficiary of Murphy Canyon as a VIE, as we had the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity, as well as the power to direct a majority of the activities that significantly impacted Murphy Canyon's economic performance. Since we were the primary beneficiary, Murphy Canyon was consolidated into our consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 Investment in Conduit Pharmaceuticals for additional details regarding Murphy Canyon.

The corrections did not affect Consolidated Statements of Operations or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in any prior periods. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, management determined that the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, overstated the amount of cash outflows for building and tenant improvements as a portion of those additions were in accounts payable at the end of each period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, and , respectively, should have been disclosed as a supplemental disclosure of cash flow information as unpaid building and tenant improvements. These errors impact the consolidated statement of cash flows and do not affect the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statements of changes in equity. 
 
 As such, the Company s consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflects an adjustment to reduce cash outflows for unpaid building and tenant improvements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities, as previously reported, of was reduced by and net cash provided by investing activities, as previously reported, of was increased by . Additionally, the of unpaid building and tenant improvements that were recorded in accounts payable as of December 31, 2023, and paid in January 2024, are included in the statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 third parties for the right to purchase certain securities held within its investment portfolios covered call options ). These option transactions are designed primarily to increase the total return associated with holding the related securities as earning assets by using fee income generated from these options. These transactions are
 not designated as hedging relationships pursuant to accounting guidance ASC
 815 and, accordingly, changes in fair values of these contracts, are reported in other income (expense). There are several risks associated with transactions in options on securities. For example, there are significant differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between these markets, causing a given transaction
 not to achieve its objectives. A transaction in options or securities
 may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events. When we write a covered call option, we forgo, during the option s life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call but retain the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline. The writer of an option has
 no control over the time when it
 may be required to fulfill its obligation before the sold option expires, and once an option writer has received an exercise notice, it must deliver the underlying security in exchange for the strike price.

 2 The non-recourse loan on the Dakota Center property matured on July 6, 2024. Management has been in negotiations with the special servicer of the loan in modifying and/or extending the loan or possibly selling the building. We have not been able to come to an agreement regarding a situation in which the loan is modified or extended. As such, in October 2024 we have offered the property for sale in conjunction with the lender s approval in attempts to make the lender whole, although there is no guarantee we will be able to do so. The loan is considered non-recourse and we will not be required to make up the difference if the property sells for less than the loan balance. See Note 4.

As we get closer to the loan maturity date, the Company will finalize our plans. Union Town Center and Research Parkway have been listed for sale, and included in the real estate assets held for sale, net on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. We expect a sale to take place during the fourth quarter of 2024, prior to the maturity of the loans for Union Town Center and Research Parkway. If the sales take longer than expected, we have options available to extend the maturity of the loan to accommodate for a longer sales period. As of September 30, 2024 , we were reviewing terms sheets to refinance the loan on Arapahoe Service Center from third party lenders.

from the Small Business Administration ("SBA") to provide economic relief during the COVID- 19 pandemic. This loan advance is not required to be repaid, has no stipulations on use, and has been recorded as fees and other income in the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2020. On August 17, 2020, we received an additional Economic Injury Disaster Loan ("EIDL") of , for which principal and interest payments are deferred for twelve months from the date of issuance, and interest accrues at 3.75 per year. The loan matures on August 17, 2050. We have used the funds for general corporate purposes to alleviate economic damage caused by the COVID- 19 pandemic, which economic injury included abating or deferring rent to certain tenants (primarily retail tenants). As of September 30, 2024 , the balance of this loan totaled approximately and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

in capital investment to acquire one or more businesses. We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, owned approximately of the issued and outstanding stock in the entity upon the initial public offering being declared effective and consummated (excluding the private placement units described below). The SPAC offered units, with each unit consisting of share of common stock and three -quarters of one redeemable warrant. The warrants were evaluated using the guidance in ASC 480 "Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity" and we concluded that the warrants are indexed to Murphy Canyon's common stock and meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders' equity. 
 
 The Murphy Canyon IPO of units of common stock and warrants, closed on February 7, 2022, raising gross proceeds for Murphy Canyon of , including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their over-allotment option. In connection with the IPO, we purchased, through the Sponsor, placement units (the "placement units") at a price of per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of . These proceeds were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Murphy Canyon public shareholders and are included in Investments held in Trust. In connection with the initial public offering, Murphy Canyon incurred in issuance costs, including of underwriting discounts and commission, of deferred underwriting fees and of other offering costs. These costs were allocated to temporary and permanent equity and offset against the proceeds. 
 
 On November 8, 2022, the SPAC entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Conduit Pharmaceuticals Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company ("Conduit Pharma"), and Conduit Merger Sub, Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company and the SPAC's wholly owned subsidiary. The merger agreement provided that the SPAC's Cayman Island subsidiary will merge with and into Conduit Pharma, with Conduit Pharma surviving the merger as the SPAC's wholly owned subsidiary and the public company renamed "Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc." ("Conduit"). 

Initially, the SPAC was required to complete its initial business combination transaction by
 12 months from the consummation of its initial public offering or up to
 18 months if it extended the period of time to consummate a business combination in accordance with its Certificate of Incorporation. On
 January 26, 2023, at a special meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders approved a proposal to amend the SPAC's certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination up to
 12 times, each such extension for an additional
 one -month period, from
 February 7, 2023 to
 February 7, 2024. The stockholders also approved a related proposal to amend the trust agreement allowing the SPAC to deposit into the trust account, for each
 one -month extension,
 one -
 third of
 1 of the funds remaining in the trust account following the redemptions made in connection with the approval of the extension proposal at the special meeting. The Company has committed to providing additional funds if needed to make such a deposit for the extension. In connection with the stockholders' vote at the special meeting,
 shares of common stock were tendered for redemption, which were redeemed in
 February 2023. Approximately
 million in cash was removed from the Trust Account to pay such stockholders and, accordingly, after giving effect to such redemptions, income tax withdraws of
 and adding
 in extension payments, the balance in the Trust Account was approximately
 million. After the redemptions, there were
 shares of SPAC Class A common stock subject to possible redemption.

On January 27, 2023, the merger agreement was amended to provide for only one class of authorized common stock of the SPAC following the business combination, instead of both authorized Class A common stock and Class B common stock as set forth in the original merger agreement. On May 11, 2023, the merger agreement was further amended to provide for (i) removal of the provision that indicates that no tax opinion would be delivered in connection with the closing, (ii) a closing obligation that that the SPAC either (a) be exempt from the provisions of Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, other than through its net tangible assets or (b) have at least of net tangible assets either immediately prior to or upon consummation of the merger, and (iii) extension of the outside date for the closing of the merger from May 31, 2023 to February 7, 2024. 
 
 The investments held in Trust for the SPAC Class A common stockholders generated approximately million of income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , and was included in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statement of operations. As of September 22, 2023, the Trust account balance had been deconsolidated along with the other Conduit assets and liabilities. 
 
 As of immediately prior to the consummation of the SPAC's business combination, which occurred on September 22, 2023, the Company, through its subsidiary, had loaned the SPAC million to fund its trust account and for operating expenses. The loan was non-interest bearing, unsecured and was repaid in full upon the SPAC's business combination on September 22, 2023. The notes payable and notes receivable related to the SPAC were eliminated through consolidation on our financial statements. 
 
 On September 22, 2023, the SPAC completed its business combination with Conduit Pharma and changed its name to Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("Conduit"). Immediately prior to the business combination, the Company owned approximately of the SPAC's outstanding common stock. Upon consummation of the business combination, the SPAC's shares of Class B common stock were converted into shares of its Class A common stock and the shares of Class A common stock were then reclassified as a single class of Conduit common stock. As a result of the business combination, the Company was issued (i) shares of Conduit's common stock due to the conversion of the shares of the SPAC's Class B common stock into shares of the SPAC's Class A common stock and then reclassification into shares of Conduit common stock, (ii) shares of Conduit common stock, which prior to the business combination were shares of the SPAC's Class A common stock and (iii) private warrants to purchase shares of Conduit common stock, which prior to the business combination were warrants to purchase shares of the SPAC's Class A common stock. Also in the business combination, shareholders and debtholders of Conduit Pharma were issued shares of Conduit common stock. Immediately following the consummation of the business combination, the Company transferred shares of Conduit common stock and warrants to purchase shares of Conduit common stock to the SPAC's independent directors as compensation for their services. As a result, the Company owned approximately of Conduit's common stock immediately following the business combination, assuming all warrants owned by the Company were exercised and as of September 30, 2024 , we own approximately of Conduit's common stock, assuming all warrants owned by the Company are exercised. In connection with the business combination, the Company's officers and directors who also served as officers and directors of the SPAC resigned from the SPAC, with the exception of the Company's former Chief Financial Officer who resigned from the Company. 
 
 Following the completion of the Murphy Canyon IPO in February 2022, we determined that Murphy Canyon is a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") in which we had a variable interest because Murphy Canyon did not have enough equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. Since the business combinations with Conduit on September 22, 2023, we have determined that Conduit's (formally Murphy Canyon) public stockholders have substantive rights and we no longer have control of Conduit's activity. Since we are no longer the controlling party, or have a majority of the issued and outstating common stock, the Company deconsolidated Conduit from our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the deconsolidation we recorded a gain of approximately million. Of the total gain recognized on deconsolidation, approximately million relates to the remeasurement of our retained investment in Murphy Canyon via the Sponsor shares which converted into shares of Conduit's common stock on September 22, 2023, and approximately million relates to the deconsolidation of Murphy Canyon's assets and liabilities as of September 22, 2023. 

Since deconsolidating Conduit, on September 22, 2023, our investments in Conduit's common stock (CDT) and public common stock warrants (CDTTW) and Private CDT Warrants presented on the consolidated balance sheets were measured at fair value using Level 1 and Level 3 market prices, taking into account the adoption of ASU 2022 - 03 Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions , and totaled approximately million as of September 30, 2024 , with a cost basis of approximately million.

Activist stockholder activities could adversely affect our business because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. We have or in the future
 may retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial, strategic and communication advisors, the costs of which
 may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholders' initiatives
 may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, business partners, and employees, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation. On
 March 13, 2024, a stockholder activist group announced its intention to file a preliminary proxy statement and accompanying WHITE universal proxy card with the Securities and Exchange Commission to be used to solicit votes for the election of director nominees at our next annual meeting of stockholders. On
 May 9, 2024, the Company entered into a cooperation agreement with this stockholder group pursuant to which Elena Piliptchak was appointed to our board of directors, effective immediately, as a Class III director with a term expiring at Presidio's
 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In connection with this appointment, our board of directors has been increased from
 six to
 seven directors. Pursuant to the agreement, the stockholder group agreed to withdraw the director nominations it had previously submitted and support our board's slate of directors at the
 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was held on
 June 27, 2024. The stockholder group has also agreed to certain customary standstill provisions and voting commitments. We have evaluated this contingency and have determined a material loss is
 not probable or estimable at this time.

Litigation. From time to time, we
 may become involved in various lawsuits or legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Neither the Company nor any of the Company's properties are presently subject to any material litigation nor, to the Company's knowledge, is there any material threatened litigation.

Environmental matters. The Company monitors its properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist, the Company is not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to the properties that would have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Further, the Company is not aware of any environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that the Company believes would require additional disclosure or recording of a loss contingency. 
 
 Financial Markets. The Company monitors concerns over economic recession, interest rate increases, policy priorities of the U.S. presidential administration, trade wars, labor shortages, and inflation, any of which may contribute to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets. Additionally, the economic and geopolitical ramifications of the military conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, including sanctions, retaliatory sanctions, nationalism, supply chain disruptions and other consequences, could impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates, and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing our loan investments. We have not currently experienced a direct material impact to our Company or operations; however, we will continue to monitor the financial markets for events that could impact our commercial real estate properties.

 OVERVIEW 
 
 The Company operates as an internally managed, diversified REIT, with primary holdings in office, industrial, retail, and triple-net leased model home properties. In October 2017, we changed our name from "NetREIT, Inc." to "Presidio Property Trust, Inc." The Company acquires, owns, and manages a geographically diversified portfolio of real estate assets, including office, industrial, retail and model home residential properties leased to homebuilders located in the United States. As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned or had an equity interest in: 

Eight office buildings and one industrial property ("Office/Industrial Properties"), which total approximately 758,175 rentable square feet; 

Three retail shopping centers ("Retail Properties"), which total approximately 65,242 rentable square feet; and 

83 model home residential properties ("Model Homes" or "Model Home Properties"), totaling approximately 251,602 square feet, leased back on a triple-net basis to homebuilders that are owned by five affiliated limited partnerships and one wholly-owned corporation, all of which we control.

We own five commercial properties located in Colorado, four in North Dakota, one in Southern California, one in Texas and one in Maryland. Our model home properties are located in three states. While geographical clustering of real estate enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale by servicing several properties with less staff, it makes us susceptible to changing market conditions in these discrete geographic areas. We do not develop properties but acquire properties that are stabilized or that we anticipate will be stabilized within two or three years of acquisition. We consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year as of January 1 of such year or has been operating for three years. 
 
 Most of our office and retail properties are leased to a variety of tenants ranging from small businesses to large public companies, many of which are not investment grade. We have, in the past, entered into, and intend in the future to enter into, purchase agreements for real estate having net leases that require the tenant to pay all of the operating expenses or pay increases in operating expenses over specific base years. Most of our office leases are for terms of three to five years with annual rental increases. Our model homes are typically leased back for two to three years to the home builder on a triple-net lease. Under a triple-net lease, the tenant is required to pay all operating, maintenance and insurance costs and real estate taxes with respect to the leased property. 
 
 We seek to diversify our portfolio by commercial real estate segments, including office, industrial, retail and model home properties to reduce the adverse effect of a single under-performing segment and/or tenant. We further mitigate risk at the tenant level through our credit review process, which varies by tenant class. For example, our commercial and industrial tenants tend to be corporations or individually owned businesses. In these cases, we typically obtain financial records, including financial statements and tax returns (depending on the circumstance), and run credit reports for any prospective tenant to support our decision to enter into a rental arrangement. We also typically obtain security deposits from these commercial tenants. Our Model Home commercial tenants are well-known homebuilders with established credit histories. These tenants are subjected to financial review and analysis prior to us entering into a sales-leaseback transaction. 
 
 In June 2024, the Board of Directors established the Strategic Planning and Cyber Committee (the "Strategic Committee"). The purpose of the Strategic Committee is to: assist the Board in carrying out its responsibilities of oversight over the Company's business strategy, make recommendations to the Board on the Company's strategic direction and objectives and serve as a liaison between the Board and management, and assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities of oversight with regard to the Company's identification, assessment, and management of the Company's cybersecurity risks. There can be no assurance that the work of the Strategic Committee will result in any transaction being pursued or consummated. In addition, there is no formal timetable for the Strategic Committee's exploration of potential strategic alternatives, and the Company does not intend to disclose any developments with respect to the Strategic Committee's activities unless and until the Company determines that further disclosure is appropriate or required by law or regulation.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as previously disclosed in our 2023 year end Annual Report . 
 
 MANAGEMENT EVALUATION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Management s evaluation of operating results includes an assessment of our ability to generate the cash flow necessary to pay operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, debt service and to fund distributions to our stockholders. As a result, management s assessment of operating results gives less emphasis to the effects of unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which may cause fluctuations in net income for comparable periods but have no impact on cash flows. Management s evaluation of our potential for generating cash flow includes assessments of our recently acquired properties, our non-stabilized properties, long-term sustainability of our real estate portfolio, our future operating cash flow from anticipated acquisitions, and the proceeds from the sales of our real estate assets. 
 
 In addition, management evaluates the results of the operations of our portfolio and individual properties with a primary focus on increasing and enhancing the value, quality and quantity of properties in our real estate holdings. Management focuses its efforts on improving underperforming assets through re-leasing efforts, including negotiation of lease renewals and rental rates. Properties are regularly evaluated for potential added value appreciation and cashflow and, if lacking such potential, are sold with the equity reinvested in new acquisitions or otherwise allocated in a manner we believe is accretive to our stockholders. Our ability to increase assets under management is affected by our ability to raise borrowings and/or capital, coupled with our ability to identify appropriate investments. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Revenues. Total revenues were approximately 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 4.5 million for the same period in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 131.4 million in net real estate assets including 83 model homes, compared to approximately 138.4 million in net real estate assets including 102 model homes at September 30, 2023. The change in revenue is directly related to the new commercial real estate leases at Grand Pacific Center, and model home transaction fees earned by the Company during the current period, slightly offset by the reduction in model home income during the current quarter. 
 
 Rental Operating Costs. Rental operating costs increased 8.1 , totaling approximately 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 1.5 million for the same period in 2023, due to the increased cost of operating our commercial properties. Rental operating costs as a percentage of total revenue was 33.8 and 33.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our model home assets made up 30.5 of our total real estate assets, which is down from 33.2 as of September 30, 2023. Model home rental operating costs are relatively low for model home assets as they are leased on a triple net basis. Additionally, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, our gross revenue from model home assets represented approximately 21.2 of our total revenue, compared to 24.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This percentage is expected to decrease in 2024 as a large number of model homes were sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no acquisitions or sales of retail, office or industrial properties during the three months ended September 30, 2024; however, management is selling two of our commercial real estate assets, totaling approximately 11.1 million, over the next 12 months, which will reduce future rental income until those proceeds are reinvested. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General Administrative G A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled approximately 1.6 million and 1.6 million, respectively. G A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 34.5 and 36.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. G A expenses was relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to approximately 1.4 million for the same period in 2023 . 
 
 Asset Impairments . We review the carrying value of each of our real estate properties regularly to determine if circumstances indicate an impairment in the carrying value of these investments exists. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of approximately 0.7 million related to three model homes and one commercial property. The impairment on our commercial property, Dakota Center, was the result of the loan maturing in July and the Company not being able to reach an agreement with the lenders regarding a loan modification or extension. In October the lender has agreed to a sale of the property to settle the balance of the non-recourse loan. Due to the uncertainties in the Fargo market, we decided to impair the property s book value, in accordance with ASC 360-10 impairment of long-lived assets. As such, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 0.7 million as of September 31, 2024. The new impairment charges for the three model homes reflects the estimated sales prices for these specific model homes in October and November 2024 as a result of an abnormally short hold period, less than two years, on model homes purchased in 2022. The builder changed their product style in the neighborhoods where these model homes are located, in Texas, after we had purchased the homes. We do not believe these losses are indicative of our overall model home portfolio. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold four model homes for approximately 2.2 million and the Company recognized a net gain of approximately 0.4 million. We expect to record a net gain on model home sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well. The Company did not recognize a non-cash impairment to our real estate assets during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Interest Expense - mortgage notes. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred finance charges was approximately 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to approximately 1.4 million for the same period in 2023 . T he weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 5.44 and 5.06 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Mortgage notes payable totaled approximately 103.2 million and 103.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Gain on Sale of Real Estate Assets, net. The change in gain or loss on the sale of real estate assets is dependent on the mix of properties sold and the market conditions at the time of the sale. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold four model homes for approximately 2.2 million, net of selling costs, and the Company recognized a net gain of approximately 0.4 million. We expect to record a net gain on model home sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we sold five model homes for approximately 2.5 million, net of selling costs, and the Company recognized a net gain of approximately 0.8 million. 
 
 Income allocated to non-controlling interests. Income allocated to non-controlling interests for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled approximately 0.4 million and 0.7 million , respectively. 
 
 Loss on Conduit remeasurement . On April 22, 2024, the Company entered into a lockup agreement with Conduit pursuant to which the Company agreed not to transfer or sell 2,700,000 of its 4,015,250 shares of Conduit common stock for a period of one year. In consideration for entering into the lockup agreement, Conduit issued the Company a warrant ("Private CDT Warrants") to purchase 540,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 3.12 per share, with a two year term and exercisable one year after the date of issue. The Private CDT Warrants meet the ASC 321 scope exception for derivative instruments and are accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815. As such, the Private CDT Warrants were recorded at fair value on the date of issuance and subsequently measured at fair value each period, with changes in fair value reported in gain or loss on Conduit Pharmaceuticals marketable securities. As of June 30 2024, the Private CDT Warrants were valued at 156,000 based on a Level 3 fair value measurement. As of September 30, 2024, the Private CDT Warrants fair value was adjusted to zero, which is included in the total Investment in Conduit Pharmaceuticals marketable securities on the September 30, 2024 consolidated balance sheet. Our investments in Conduit's common stock (3,990,319 shares of CDT) and public common stock warrants (709,000 warrants of CDTTW) presented on the consolidated balance sheets were measured at fair value using Level 1 market prices, taking into account the adoption of ASU 2022-03 Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions , and totaled approximately 0.5 million as of September 30, 2024. The combined value of our Investment in Conduit Pharmaceuticals marketable securities, including the Private CDT Warrants, totaled 0.5 million as of September 30, 2024. In connection with these fair market value adjustments during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net loss on our investment in Conduit of approximately 3.9 million. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE nine MONTHS ENDED September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Revenues. Total revenues were approximately 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 13.1 million for the same period in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 131.4 million in net real estate assets including 83 model homes, compared to approximately 138.4 million in net real estate assets including 102 model homes at September 30, 2023. The average number of model homes held during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 84 and 102, respectively. The change in revenue is directly related to the increase in model home transaction fees during the current period, new commercial real estate leases, mainly at Grand Pacific Center, and the management fees earned from Conduit Pharma during the current period, which was terminated in June 2024. Below is additional revenue and asset information for real estate segments as of September 30, 2024.

 Rental Operating Costs. Rental operating costs were slightly higher totaling 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 4.5 million for the same period in 2023. Rental operating costs as a percentage of total revenue was 33.0 and 33.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our model home assets made up 30.5 of our total real estate assets, which is down from 33.2 as of September 30, 2023. Model home rental operating costs are relatively low for model home assets as they are leased on a triple net basis. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross revenue from model home assets represented approximately 24.2 of our total revenue, compared to 22.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This percentage is expected to decrease in 2024 as a large number of model homes were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no acquisitions or sales of retail, office or industrial properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024; however, management is selling two of our commercial real estate assets, totaling approximately 11.1 million, over the next 12 months, which will reduce future rental income until those proceeds are reinvested. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses. G A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled approximately 5.9 million and 5.4 million, respectively. G A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 42.0 and 41.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. G A expenses increased by approximately 0.5 million mainly related to the 2024 annual meeting and settlement with Zuma Capital and certain individuals and entities affiliated or associated with Zuma Capital Management, LLC (Zuma Capital"). This included additional consulting fees, higher proxy solicitation fees and legal fees, which increased by an aggregate of approximately 0.6 million in 2024 as compared to 2023. Additionally, stock compensation and bonus accruals increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 0.5 million as compared to the same period in 2023 related to De-SPAC success bonuses to current and former employees. This was slightly offset by the reduction in salaries and employees cost by approximately 0.2 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, and the approximately 0.2 million reduction of D O insurance related to the SPAC in 2023 that was not consolidated during 2024. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately 4.2 million and 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Asset Impairments . We review the carrying value of each of our real estate properties regularly to determine if circumstances indicate an impairment in the carrying value of these investments exists. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of approximately 0.9 million related to model homes and one commercial property. The impairment on our commercial property, Dakota Center, was the result of the loan maturing in July and the Company not being able to reach an agreement with the lenders regarding a loan modification or extension. In October the lender has agreed to a sale of the property to settle the balance of the non-recourse loan. Due to the uncertainties in the Fargo market, we decided to impair the property s book value, in accordance with ASC 360-10 impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of, to be in line with the current loan balance and estimated closing costs, which is the expected sales price. As such, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 0.7 million, as of September 31, 2024. The new impairment charges for the model homes reflects the estimated and actual sales prices for these specific model homes that were sold after the end of each quarter. This was the result of an abnormally short hold period, less than two years, on model homes purchased in 2022. The builder changed their product style in the neighborhoods where these model homes are located, in Texas, after we had purchased the homes. We do not believe these losses are indicative of our overall model home portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 46 model homes for approximately 22.3 million, net of sales costs, and the Company recognized a net gain of approximately 3.2 million. We expect to record a net gain on model home sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well. The Company did not recognize a non-cash impairment to our real estate assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our anticipated future sources of liquidity may include existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, refinancing of existing mortgages, future real estate sales, new borrowings from our model home lines of credit, the sale of our investment in Conduit Pharma, and the sale of our equity or issuance of debt securities or bonds. Our cash and restricted cash at September 30, 2024 was approximately 7.2 million. Our future capital needs include paying down existing borrowings, maintaining our existing properties, funding tenant improvements, paying lease commissions (to the extent they are not covered by lender-held reserve deposits), and the payment of dividends to our stockholders. We also are actively seeking model home investments that are likely to produce income and achieve long-term gains in order to pay dividends to our stockholders. To ensure that we can effectively execute these objectives, we routinely review our liquidity requirements and continually evaluate all potential sources of liquidity. 
 
 Our short-term liquidity needs include paying our current operating costs, satisfying the debt service requirements of our existing mortgages, completing tenant improvements, paying leasing commissions, and funding dividends to stockholders. Future principal payments due on our mortgage notes payables during 2024 total approximately 11.7 million, of which approximately 2.3 million is related to model home properties. During the next 12 months, five commercial property loans, in addition to the Dakota Center which matured in July 2024, for Research Parkway, Arapahoe Service Center, Union Town Center, One Park, and Genesis Plaza, have mortgage loans that will mature totaling approximately 28.4 million. The loan on the Dakota Center matured on July 6, 2024. Management was in negotiations with the special servicer of the loan in modifying and/or extending; however no agreement could be reached and in October we had agreed with the lender to sell the property in order to settle the balance on the non-recourse loan. The Company and the lender are currently reviewing real estate brokers to sell the property on the open market with the hopes of obtaining the best sales price; however there can be no guarantee the property will sell for more than the loan balance. 
 
 Management has begun discussions with various lenders to either restructure, extend or refinance the other three loans. Additionally, management may consider selling these properties if we are unsuccessful in extending the maturity dates or are unable to raise additional funds to pay these non-recourse loans in full. Only the loan on Research Parkway, for 1.6 million has recourse to the Company. Management expects certain model homes will be sold, and that the underlying mortgage notes will be paid off with sales proceeds, while other mortgage notes will be refinanced as the Company has done in the past. Additional principal payments will be made with cash flows from ongoing operations. On December 31, 2022, the lease for our largest tenant at that time, Halliburton, expired. Halliburton was located in our Shea Center II property in Colorado and did not renew the lease. We placed approximately 1.1 million in a reserve account with our lender to cover future mortgage payments, if necessary, in connection with Halliburton's vacant space, none of which has been used as of December 31, 2023. This reserve amount is included in "Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash" on the consolidated balance sheet. Our management team is working to fill the 45,535 square foot space and has leased approximately 35 of the space to a tenant during 2023 and 2024 and has reviewed various third party proposals for the remaining 65 . As of September 30, 2024, management is pursuing third party tenants who fit into our long-term plans, however, there is no guarantee we will be successful in signing these new tenants. 
 
 While we will continue to pursue value creating investments, the Board of Directors believes there is significant embedded value in our assets that is yet to be realized by the market. Therefore, returning capital to stockholders through a repurchase program is an attractive use of capital currently. On September 15, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 6.0 million of outstanding shares of our Series A Common Stock and up to 4.0 million of our Series D Preferred Stock, which expired in September 2023. In November 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 6.0 million of outstanding shares of our Series A Common Stock and up to 4.0 million of our Series D Preferred Stock which shall expire in November 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 23,041 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock at an average price of approximately 16.06 per share, including a commission of 0.035 per share, and no shares of our Series A Common Stock, for a total cost of 0.4 million for the Series D Preferred Stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 137,709 shares of our Series A Common Stock, for a total cost of 97,394, with an average price of approximately 0.7072 per share. There were no repurchases of Series D Preferred Stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Any repurchased shares are treated as authorized and unissued in accordance with Maryland law and shown as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost. 
 
 There can be no assurance that the Company will refinance loans, take out additional financing or capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms, if at all. If events or circumstances occur such that the Company does not obtain additional funding, it will most likely be required to reduce its plans, reduce certain discretionary spending or even sell properties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives. We believe that cash on hand, cash flow from our existing portfolio, distributions from joint ventures in Model Home Partnerships and property sales during 2024 and 2025 will be sufficient to fund our operating costs, planned capital expenditures and required dividends for at least the next twelve months. If our cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to fund our short-term liquidity needs, we plan to fund a portion of these needs from additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness, from real estate sales, issuance of debt instruments, additional investors, or we may reduce or suspend the rate of dividends to our stockholders.

Table of Contents 

Our long-term liquidity needs include the capital necessary to grow and maintain our portfolio of investments. We believe that the potential financing capital available to us in the future is sufficient to fund our long-term liquidity needs. We are continually reviewing our existing portfolio to determine which properties have met our short- and long-term goals and while seeking to reinvest the proceeds in properties with better potential to increase performance. We expect to obtain additional cash in connection with refinancing of maturing mortgages and assumption of existing debt collateralized by some or all of our real property in the future to meet our long-term liquidity needs. If we are unable to arrange a line of credit, borrow on properties, privately place securities or sell securities to the public, we may not be able to acquire additional properties to meet our long-term objectives. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has not declared a cash dividend for the Series A Common stockholders. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company declared and paid approximately 0.3 million and 0.9 million in a cash dividend, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company declared and paid approximately 0.6 million and 1.7 million in monthly cash dividends, respectively for the Series D Preferred stockholders. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company declared and paid approximately 0.5 million and 1.6 million in monthly cash dividends, respectively. 
 
 The Company is reviewing when it may pay dividends to our common stockholders on a quarterly basis again, cash permitting, and intends to continue on a monthly basis to pay dividends to holders of our Series D Preferred Stock going forward, but there can be no guarantee the Board of Directors will approve any future dividends. The Company is still considering how much it may declare during 2024 on the Series A Common Stock, as there was no cash dividend declared or paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The following is a summary of distributions declared per share of our Series A Common Stock and for our Series D Preferred Stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Our long-term liquidity needs include the proceeds necessary to grow and maintain our portfolio of investments. We believe that the potential financing capital available to us in the future is sufficient to fund our long-term liquidity needs. We are continually reviewing our existing portfolio to determine which properties have met our short- and long-term goals and while seeking to reinvest the proceeds in properties with better potential to increase performance. We expect to obtain additional cash in connection with refinancing of maturing mortgages and assumption of existing debt collateralized by some or all of our real property in the future to meet our long-term liquidity needs. If we are unable to arrange a line of credit, borrow on properties, issue debt instruments, privately place securities or sell securities to the public, we may not be able to acquire additional properties to meet our long-term objectives. 
 
 Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , we had approximately 7.2 million and 6.5 million in cash equivalents, respectively, including 3.5 million and 3.7 million of restricted cash, respectively. O ur cash equivalents and restricted cash consist of invested cash, cash in our operating accounts, short-term bonds and cash held in bank accounts at third-party institutions. During 2024 and 2023 , we did not experience any loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalen ts. Approximately 1.5 million to 2.0 million of our cash balance is intended for capital expenditures on existing properties, net of any construction financing (some of which is held in deposits reserve accounts by our lenders) during the rest of the year. We intend to use the remainder of our existing cash and cash equivalents for asset/property acquis itions, reduction of principal debt, general corporate purposes, common stock repurchases (if market conditions are met), or dividends to our stockholders. 

Secured Debt 

As of
 September 30, 2024, all our commercial properties, except 300 N.P. which has no debt, had fixed-rate mortgage notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of 
 75.6 million, collateralized by a total of 
 11 commercial properties with loan terms at issuance ranging from 5 to 10 years. The weighted-average interest rate on these mortgage notes payable as of
 September 30, 2024, was approximately
 4.97 , and our debt to estimated market value for our commercial properties was approximately 
 65.2 . During the next 12 months, five of our commercial property loans, totaling approximately 28.4 million, will mature, with an estimated combined loan to value of approximately 59.6 as of
 September 30, 2024. The non-recourse loan on the Dakota Center property matured on July 6, 2024. During October 2024, management has agreed with the lender to sell the property to settle the loan balance. Due to the uncertainties in the Fargo market, we have decided to impair the property s book value, in accordance with ASC 360-10 impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of, to be in line with the current loan balance and estimated closing costs, which is the expected sales price. As such, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 0.7 million, as of 
 September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had fixed-rate mortgage notes payable related to model homes in the aggregate principal amount of 27.5 million, excluding loans eliminated through consolidation, collateralized by a total of 82 Model Homes. These loans generally have a term at issuance of three to five years. As of September 30, 2024, the average loan balance per home outstanding and the weighted-average interest rate on these mortgage loans are approximately 335,826 and 6.74 , respectively. Our debt to estimated market value on all our model home properties is approximately 56.0 , excluding any loans eliminated through consolidation. We have been able to refinance maturing mortgages to extend maturity dates and we have not experienced any notable difficulties financing our acquisitions. The Company anticipates that any new mortgages used to acquire commercial properties or model homes in the near future will be at rates higher than our currently weighted average interest rate. As of September 30, 2024 , we had issued one promissory note to our majority owned subsidiary, Dubose Model Home Investors 202 LP, for the refinancing of one model home property in Texas, for approximately 0.3 million with an interest rate of 5.55 per annum and original maturity date of August 15, 2024, which was extended for another year with an interest rate of 8.0 per annum. This note payable and note receivable, including interest expense and interest income related to this promissory note, is eliminated through consolidation on our financial statements. This property was subsequently sold in October 2024, and the loan was paid in full. 
 
 Cash Flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and September 30, 2023 
 
 Operating Activities: Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , totaled approximately 1.0 million , as compared to cash used in operating activities of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The change in net cash used in operating activities is mainly due to changes in net income, which fluctuates due to new leases, leasing renewals, tenant move outs and model home sales and acquisitions, as well as changes in non-cash addbacks or subtractions such as straight-line rent. 
 
 Investing Activities: Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was approximately 10.7 million compared to approximately 129.0 million used in investing activities during the same period in 2023 . The change from each period was primarily related to the gross cash withdrawal of approximately 114.1 million during the first quarter of 2023 for SPAC redemptions. There were no similar transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Proceeds from the sale of real estate assets total approximately 22.3 million, net of selling costs, while cash used in real estate acquisition and capital improvement totaled approximately 11.7 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

We currently project that we could spend up to 1.5 million to 2.0 million (some of which is held in deposits reserve accounts by our lenders) on capital improvements, tenant improvements and leasing costs for properties within our portfolio during the next 12 months. Capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature, extent, and timing of improvements required to the properties. We may spend more on capital expenditures in the future due to rising construction costs. Tenant improvements and leasing costs may also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the property, the term of the lease, the type of lease, the involvement of external leasing agents and overall market conditions. 
 
 Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , was 8.9 million compared to 137.4 million provided by financing activities for the same period in 2023 and was primarily due to the following activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 : 

Proceeds from mortgage notes payable, net of issuance costs totaled approximately 13.6 million. 

Proceeds from the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock, net of offering costs, totaled approximately 1.2 million. 

Repayment of mortgage notes payable totaled approximately 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 

Distributions to noncontrolling interest of approximately 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Dividends paid to Series D Preferred Stockholders of approximately 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 On July 12, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single U.S. institutional investor for the purchase and sale of 1,000,000 shares of its Series A Common Stock, Common Stock Warrants to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of Series A Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of Series A Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock and accompanying Common Stock Warrants were sold together at a combined offering price of 5.00, and each share of Common Stock and accompanying Pre-Funded Warrant were sold together at a combined offering price of 4.99. The Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised in full during August 2021 at a nominal exercise price of 0.01 per share. The Common Stock Warrants have an exercise price of 5.50 per share, exercisable upon issuance and will expire five years from the date of issuance. 
 
 In connection with this additional offering, we agreed to issue the Placement Agent Warrants to purchase up to 80,000 shares of Series A Common Stock, representing 4.0 of the Series A Common Stock and shares of Series A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants. The Placement Agent Warrants were issued in August 2021, post exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants with an exercise price of 6.25 and will expire five years from the date of issuance. 
 
 Common Stock Warrants: 
 If all the potential Common Stock Warrants outstanding at September 30, 2024, were exercised at the price of 5.00 per share, gross proceeds to us would be approximately 10.0 million and we would as a result issue an additional 2,000,000 shares of common stock. 
 
 Placement Agent Warrants: 
 If all the potential Placement Agent Warrants outstanding at September 30, 2024, were exercised at the price of 6.25 per share, gross proceeds to us would be approximately 0.5 million and we would as a result issue an additional 80,000 shares of common stock.

Table of Contents 

January 14, 2022, was the record date with respect to the distribution of five-year listed warrants (the Series A Warrants ). The Series A Warrants and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Series A Warrants were registered on a registration statement that was filed with the SEC and was declared effective January 21, 2022. The Series A Warrants commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol SQFTW on January 24, 2022 and were distributed on that date to persons who held shares of common stock and existing outstanding warrants as of the January 14, 2022 record date, or who acquired shares of common stock in the market following the record date, and who continued to hold such shares at the close of trading on January 21, 2022. The Series A Warrants give the holder the right to purchase one share of common stock at 7.00 per share, for a period of five years. Should warrant holders not exercise the Series A Warrants during that holding period, the Series A Warrants will automatically convert to 1/10 of a common share at expiration, rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares. 
 
 Series A Warrants: 
 If all the potential Series A Warrants outstanding at September 30, 2024, were exercised at the price of 7.00 per share, gross proceeds to us would be approximately 101.2 million and we would as a result issue an additional 14,450,069 shares of common stock. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), or increases in the clients sales volumes. We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. 
 
 However, our use of net lease agreements tends to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the client is responsible for property expenses. Inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this item. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-14(c). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. In connection with the preparation and audit of the financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, a material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This material weakness primarily relates to a non-recuring significant transaction for income tax provision under ASC 740, Income Taxes , and comprises the following: 

We lack a formal review and approval process in connection with the annual income tax provision, specifically related to REIT and non-REIT subsidiaries and the ownership of Conduit shares received by the Company in the de-SPAC transaction on September 22, 2023. 

We did not design adequate internal controls under an appropriate financial reporting framework, including monitoring controls and certain entity level controls with regards to the income tax provision. 

41

Table of Contents 

If this material weakness is not remediated, it could result in a misstatement of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. We are implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate this material weakness, although they have not been fully remediated as of the date of this filing. 
 
 The material weakness will not be considered remediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented, the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded, through testing, that the newly implemented and enhanced controls are operating effectively. We commenced the remediation plan and will be documenting and implementing such plan, followed with testing such controls over time. We cannot predict the success of such efforts or the outcome of its assessment of the remediation efforts. Our efforts may not remediate this material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or additional material weaknesses may be identified in the future. A failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and cause a decline in the price of our common stock. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We are adding controls around the calculation and preparation of income tax provisions and expenses, we are engaging with third party experts, and will continually identify and monitor the taxable status of each subsidiary for annual reporting. There were no additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, we do not believe that these controls have been impacted by COVID-19 related circumstances, including remote work arrangements with our employees.

 Stock Repurchase Program . While we will continue to pursue value creating investments, the Board of Directors believes there is significant embedded value in our assets that is yet to be realized by the market. Therefore, returning capital to stockholders through a repurchase program is an attractive use of capital currently. On September 15, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 6.0 million of outstanding shares of our Series A Common Stock and up to 4.0 million of our Series D Preferred Stock, which expired in September 2023. In November 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to 6.0 million of outstanding shares of our Series A Common Stock and up to 4.0 million of our Series D Preferred Stock which shall expire in November 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 23,041 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock at an average price of approximately 16.06 per share, including a commission of 0.035 per share, and no shares of our Series A Common Stock, for a total cost of 0.4 million for the Series D Preferred Stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 137,709 shares of our Series A Common Stock, for a total cost of 97,394, with an average price of approximately 0.7072 per share. There were no repurchases of Series D Preferred Stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Any repurchased shares are treated as authorized and unissued in accordance with Maryland law and shown as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost. The repurchased shares will be treated as authorized and unissued in accordance with Maryland law and shown as a reduction of stockholders' equity at cost. The following table contains information for shares of common stock repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
