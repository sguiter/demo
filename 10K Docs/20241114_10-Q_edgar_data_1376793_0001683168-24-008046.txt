In September 2021, the Company and Delaware entered
into a separate agreement under Enviro for a specific project (referred to as Ameredev ). Delaware has certain contracts
in place to provide recycled water to operators of certain active oil and gas wells. Under the agreement, the Company contributed 1.2
million that was used by Ameredev to increase the capacity of certain pipelines and water treatment facilities operated by Delaware. Pursuant
to the agreement, for each barrel of recycled water that Ameredev sells, Delaware will receive 0.10 per barrel, and the Company will
receive 0.05 per barrel (referred to as usage fees), with the balance of net income (loss) from Ameredev being allocated 70 to Delaware
and 30 to the Company. The Ameredev agreement will terminate the earlier of three years (unless extended by unanimous agreement of the
Board and Members of Ameredev) from the date of the agreement or by unanimous agreement of the Board and Members of Ameredev. 

Based upon the operations of Ameredev and the facts
and circumstance of the industry it operates, due to a number of factors, Management has concluded that it was no longer possible to determine
reasonable and objectively supportable projections and estimates with regards to the recoverability of the equity method investment. As
such, at June 30, 2023, the Company determined the equity method investment was impaired and recorded an additional in
loss to its investment, reducing the value of the equity method investment to a de minimis amount of . 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon
current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as its plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Its actual results
and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

Overview of our Business 

Cavitation Technologies, Inc. ("CTi"), a
Nevada corporation, was originally incorporated under the name Bio Energy, Inc. We design and engineer environmentally friendly technology-based
systems that are designed to serve large, growing, global markets such as vegetable oil refining, renewable fuels, water treatment, algae
oil extraction, biodiesel production, water-oil emulsions and crude oil yield enhancement. Our systems are designed to process
industrial liquids at a lower cost and higher yield than conventional technology. We are a process and product development firm that has
developed, patented, and commercialized proprietary technology. 

CTi has developed, patented, and commercialized proprietary
technology that can be used for processing of industrial fluids. CTi's patented Nano Reactor is the critical components
of the CTi Nano Neutralization System which is commercially proven to reduce operating costs and increase yields
in processing oils and fats. CTi has two issued patents relating to our Nano Reactor systems and has filed several
national and international patents to employ its proprietary technology in applications including, vegetable oil refining, biodiesel production,
waste water treatment, algae oil extraction, and alcoholic beverage enhancement. 

We were engaged in manufacturing our Nano-Reactors,
which are designed to help refine vegetable oils, biodiesel transesterification and treatment of produced and frack water. 

In prior years we have developed a number of new
applications utilizing the core principal of our technology. Our low pressure non-reactors (LPN) can be utilized in multiple industries
that process large volumes of fluids and we anticipate accelerated commercial sales in our fiscal 2025. Further, we have miniaturized
our non-reactors to be utilized in various consumer oriented products, such as, processing and enhancing spirits and wines, drinking water
with infusion of vitamins, minerals and cannabidiol (CBD) oil. 

We had agreements to license our technology globally
through our strategic partners, Desmet Belgium Group (Desmet) and Enviro Watertek, LLC (EW) and Alchemy Beverages, Inc (ABI). 

In October 2024, we entered into a Patent Assignment
and License Back Agreement with Desmet to assign certain patents, intellectual property rights and trademarks related to vegetable oil
refining to Desmet, as consideration for the patent assignments, Desmet agreed to pay the Company 880,000 in cash. This transaction will
provide the necessary capital for continuous operations and business development of our company. 

Key points of the Agreement included: 

Reserved
License : we retained a worldwide, exclusive, transferable, and royalty-free license to practice and use the Assigned Patents in the
fields of water and wastewater processing, recovery, recycling, and purification (including oilfield wastewater), as well as the manufacture,
distillation, brewing, enhancement, sale, and marketing of alcoholic beverages (the Licensed Fields ). 

Grant-Back License : we received a worldwide, exclusive, transferable, and royalty-free license
to practice and use the Assigned Patents and associated technical information, consistent with the scope of the Reserved License. 

Trademark
Usage : we retained exclusive rights to use the Nano Reactor mark for our businesses, systems, and products related
to the Licensed Fields. 

16 

Under both the Reserved License and the Grant-Back
License, the Company will have a worldwide, exclusive, transferable, and royalty-free license and right to design, build, use, export,
improve, sell, and market Nano Reactor devices, as well as Nano Reactor systems and products that incorporate or utilize Nano
Reactor devices, limited to uses and applications within one or more of the Licensed Fields. 

As a result of this agreement, the Company expects
that Desmet will start to manufacture the Nano reactors by itself and sale of Nano reactors to Desmet by the Company will significantly
be reduced in future periods. We will continue to own and operate a large portfolio of patents and intellectual property rights
in applications not related to vegetable oil refining. The following are Management s plans going forward to generate revenues and
sustain the operations of the Company and its current status: 

1. Water Treatment and Remediation in the Permian Basin 
 
 2. Water Remediation and Disinfection in Agriculture 
 
 3. Business Venture with Alchemy Beverages, Inc. 
 
 4. New Technologies: Hydro-Plasma 

1. Water Treatment and Remediation in the
Permian Basin 

From 2020 to 2022, our joint venture with Enviro Watertek,
LLC restarted water treatment operations in the Permian Basin. Although our technology demonstrated commercial viability (approximately
3 million barrels treated), our partner was unable to expand and attract new customers due to significant shifts in the oil gas
industry. It has taken several years to rearrange and adapt our technology to fit new customers operations. 

Currently, we have installed our system at a major
water remediation company in Texas, where it has been in place for over six months, with more testing required. We continue to pursue
additional customers, primarily in the Permian Basin. 

What differentiates us in the industry: 

No chemical usage in water remediation, significantly reducing operational costs. 
 
 Integration into existing processes within 24 hours, without disrupting ongoing operations. 
 
 Compact systems with minimal energy consumption. 
 
 Post-treatment water can be either reused or safely disposed of. 

The Company anticipates that sales will be generated
in the first half of fiscal 2025. 

2. Water Remediation and Disinfection in
Agriculture 

In
2024, we installed our first system at Hacienda Farms (B F Greenhouse Services, Inc.) in Canada. The system is currently
undergoing trials to increase oxygen levels in the water, eliminate algae, and control bacterial growth, all without the use of harsh
chemicals. This innovative technology is designed to improve water quality and promote healthier crop growth. 

Hacienda Farms, relies heavily on water from Lake
Erie, which poses significant water remediation challenges due to issues like algae and bacterial contamination. Additionally, Hacienda
Farms has been dealing with high sodium levels in the water, which affect calcium absorption in plants, and fungal issues that harm root
health, ultimately reducing crop yields. These water quality challenges necessitate advanced remediation solutions to ensure the sustainability
and productivity of their greenhouse operations. Our technology addresses these problems by controlling microorganisms, accelerating vegetative
and root growth, and increasing overall plant biomass. This not only improves crop production but also supports sustainable farming practices. 

17 

The overall market for water
treatment in Canada is valued at approximately 2.51 billion, with continuous expansion due to the demand for sustainable solutions
in agriculture and industrial applications. 

The outcome of the trials mentioned above, which
we expect to be completed within the first calendar quarter of 2025, will determine the commercial viability of our product and the timeline
for any potential revenue generation. 

3. Business Venture with Alchemy Beverages,
Inc. 

Over the past several years, we have worked closely
with Alchemy Beverages, Inc. ABI to develop the smart home kitchen appliance Barmuze and alcoholic beverages. Significant
work has been done on Barmuze branding, including launching a new website and creating animations throughout the year to showcase how
the appliance works. ABI is actively pursuing the commercial production of Barmuze, licensing the technology to third parties, and considering
the opportunity to develop its own alcohol brands, leveraging our cutting-edge technology to transform any alcohol into a smooth, top-shelf
experience. 

ABI is in the final stages of completing its financial
audit, which is estimated to be completed on or before December 31, 2024, engaging focus groups for Barmuze acceptance, refining marketing
and distribution strategies, and securing additional capital for production. The Company also plans on obtaining additional financing
in early 2025. 

The earliest sales and revenue for Barmuze are
anticipated in the second half of 2025. Also, ABI is working on creating its own line of alcoholic beverages and licensing of the technology
to other brands. For more information, www.alchemybeveragesinc.com and www.barmuze.com. 

4. New Technologies: Hydro-Plasma 

Along with improving our existing technologies, we
have developed Hydoplasma, an innovative process combining cavitation and cold plasma technology to enhance our water treatment efficiency,
which: 

Breaks down both organic and inorganic compounds. 
 
 Is highly scalable from 15 to 40 GPM. 
 
 Eliminates microorganisms and diseases. 
 
 Has multiple industrial applications. 
 
 The technology is patent pending. 

This cutting-edge technology creates reactive agents,
such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide, that break down pollutants, bacteria, and viruses in water more effectively than traditional
methods. It s an environmentally friendly and scalable solution, with applications in water treatment, agriculture, sulfur removal
from bunker fuel, and more. 

The global cold plasma market is projected
to grow from 1.5 billion in 2021 to 3.1 billion by 2027, fueled by increasing demand for sustainable water solutions. Our
technology has the potential to revolutionize water treatment on a global scale. To accelerate this development, we have established partnerships
with New Mexico State University, the University of Guadalajara, and the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility
(BGNDRF), NM, to collaborate on water remediation programs. 

In order to develop these markets we may need additional
funding, and may attempt to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to fund operations and additional working capital. However,
there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such financing or obtain sufficient amounts necessary to meet our business
needs, or that we will be able to meet our future contractual obligations. 

Testing of the technology is currently underway.
Upon a completion of multiple trials, if successful, sales and revenue are anticipated in the first half of 2025. 

18 

Inflation 

Global inflation remains a factor in 2024/5, with
interest rates in the US remaining at higher levels, although there have been some indication from the federal reserve that these rates
may decrease, inflationary indicators remain above expectations, delaying any interest rate decreases. The Russia and Ukraine and now
the Israeli and Hamas conflict and other geopolitical conflicts, as well as related international response, have exacerbated inflationary
pressures, including causing increases in the price for goods and services and global supply chain disruptions, which have resulted and
may continue to result in shortages in food products, materials and services. Such shortages have resulted and may continue to result
in inflationary cost increases for labor, fuel, food products, materials and services, and could continue to cause costs to increase as
well as result in the scarcity of certain materials. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation or other negative economic
factors or associated increases in our operating costs and how that may impact our business. To the extent we and our customers we service
are unable to recover higher operating costs resulting from inflation or otherwise mitigate the impact of such costs on our and their
business, our revenues and gross profit could decrease, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, during the
three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 227,000 and had a stockholders deficit of 27,074,000
as of September 30, 2024. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s June 30,
2024, financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from an inability of the Company to continue
as a going concern. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company has cash
in the amount of 2,000. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to implement
its business plan. Currently, management s plan is to increase revenues by continuing to license its technology globally. While
the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to increase revenues, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company believes
it has enough cash to sustain operations through March 2025. 

The Company may also attempt to raise additional debt
and/or equity financing to fund operations and to provide additional working capital. There is no assurance that such financing will be
available in the future or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet the Company s needs, that the Company will be able to
achieve profitable operations or that the Company will be able to meet its future contractual obligations. Should management fail to obtain
such financing, the Company may curtail its operations.

Cash Flow 

Net cash used in operating activities was 179,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and net cash generated by operating activities was 122,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. Changes in our cash flows was due to changes in operating assets and liabilities as well as advances from Desmet. During the
period ended September 30, 2023, the Company received advances from Desmet of 304,000 compared to none during the period ended September
30, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates 

 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date and reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates are used for allowance for impairment analysis for
property and equipment, accrual of potential liabilities, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, and assumption in valuing our stock
options, warrants, and common stock issued for services, among other items. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Revenue Recognition 

 The Company follows the guidance of Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts,
which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract
or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and
(5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it
is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients.
Revenue from sale of our Nano Reactors is recognized when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities as this is our sole performance
obligation under these contracts and we have no continuing obligation to the customer. In addition, the Company also recognizes revenues
from usage fees of certain reactors. Usage fees are recognized based on actual usage by the customer. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

See Note 1 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

Not applicable for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In accordance with rule 13a-15(a), CTi management
must maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange
Act, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms, and accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) and (c), management
must also evaluate the effectiveness of these disclosure control and procedures at the end of each fiscal year. As of September 30, 2024
the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that
evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during
the first quarter of fiscal 2025 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company's internal control
over financial reporting.
