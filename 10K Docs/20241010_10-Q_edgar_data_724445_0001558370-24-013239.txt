 At August 31, 2024, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of , which includes a valuation allowance of . The Company s ability to utilize net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards will depend on its ability to generate adequate future taxable income. The Company has historical earnings on which to base an expectation of future taxable income. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has been provided. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Act"), NOL carryforwards generated in years beginning after December 31, 2017, would carryforward indefinitely, and would apply to of future taxable income. Under the Act, carrybacks of NOLs were disallowed. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act was enacted providing a five-year carryback for losses incurred in 2018, 2019, or 2020, which allows companies to modify tax returns up to five years prior to offset taxable income from those tax years. The CARES Act also temporarily suspended the NOL limit of of taxable income. As of August 31, 2024, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of that will expire between 2026 and 2038, and that will carryforward indefinitely.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion of the financial condition of the Company as of August 31, 2024, and the results of operations comparing the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report and in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024. Forward-Looking Statements Certain matters discussed in this quarterly report, except for historical information contained herein, may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions. These statements encompass information that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact and often may be identified with words such as anticipates, believes, expects, estimates, intends, plans, projects and other similar expressions. Management s expectations and assumptions regarding Company operations and other future results are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Introduction The Company is primarily engaged as a research and development facility of drugs currently being tested for the use in the treatment of cancer, and provides consulting services. The Company s clinical trial initiated in April 2016 for children and adults with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) (protocol BT-55 is currently under full clinical hold. On September 3, 2004, the FDA granted the Company s request for orphan drug designation ODD for the Company s Antineoplastons (A10 AS2-1 Antineoplaston) for treatment of patients with brain stem glioma and, on October 30, 2008, the FDA granted the Company s request for ODD for Antineoplastons (A10 and AS2-1 Antineoplaston) for the treatment of gliomas. On January 13, 2009, the Company announced that the Company had reached an agreement with the FDA for the Company to move forward with a pivotal Phase III clinical trial of combination Antineoplaston therapy plus radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse, intrinsic brainstem gliomas DBSG ). The agreement was made under the FDA s Special Protocol Assessment procedure, meaning that the design and planned analysis of the Phase III study of combination Antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 plus radiation therapy RT in patients with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic brainstem glioma (protocol BT-52 ), are acceptable to support a regulatory submission seeking new drug approval. However, the FDA placed a full clinical hold on IND 43742 regarding such Phase III clinical trial. Please see the section below entitled Clinical Hold on Phase II and Phase III Clinical Trials. Clinical Hold on Phase II and Phase III Clinical Trials In a letter dated June 25, 2012, the Company informed the FDA of a serious adverse event in which a patient who was receiving Antineoplastons developed grade 4 hypernatremia and subsequently died. The Antineoplaston-related hypernatremia was categorized by the investigator as possibly related to the study drug. Of the 2,297 patients who have received at least one dose of Antineoplastons, the serious adverse events (SAEs) which have been experienced are as follows: hemoglobin (grade 3: 0.13 ; grade 4: 0.04 ), extravasation (grade 3: 0.04 ), pain (grade 3: 0.04 ), fatigue (grade 3: 0.09 ; grade 4: 0.04 ), fever (grade 3: 0.09 ), injection site reaction (grade 3: 0.04 ), vomiting (grade 3: 0.09 ), hypernatremia (grade 3: 0.09 ; grade 4: 1.12 ; grade 5: 0.26 ), confusion (grade 3: 0.04 ), seizure (grade 3: 0.04 ), somnolence (grade 3: 0.35 ; grade 4: 0.04 ), pain: head/headache (grade 3: 0.09 and pain: joint (grade 3: 0.04 ).

 On July 30, 2012, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold for enrollment of new pediatric patients under single patient protocols or in any of the active Phase II or Phase III studies under IND 43742. The FDA imposed this partial clinical hold because, according to the FDA, insufficient information had been submitted by the Company to allow the FDA to determine whether the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of treatment use, and that the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated. The FDA cited 21 C.F.R. 312.42(b)(2)(i), 21 C.F.R. 312.42(b)(1)(iv), and 21 C.F.R. 312.42(b)(3)(i), as grounds for imposition of a clinical hold; and 21 C.F.R. 312.305(a)(2), a criteria for expanded access use. The FDA advised the Company that until it resolved the matter to the FDA s satisfaction, the Company could not enroll new pediatric patients in any protocol under such IND. The Company later notified the FDA in a September 24, 2012 letter that it was closing pediatric protocol BT-10 (under IND 43742) for enrollment effective September 25, 2012, and that it would also terminate the protocol once all active patients had completed the study. As of February 17, 2015, all patients discontinued treatment under protocol BT-10 and such protocol was closed as of March 10, 2015. In a teleconference on January 9, 2013 between the FDA and the Company, followed by a letter of the same date, the FDA notified the Company that the agency was placing IND 43742 on partial clinical hold, due to a lack of a complete response to the issues raised by the FDA and what the FDA deemed a misleading, erroneous, and incomplete investigator brochure. The FDA cited 21 C.F.R. 312.42(b)(2)(i) and 21 C.F.R. 312.42(b)(1)(iii), as grounds for imposition of a clinical hold. The FDA further advised the Company that until it resolved the matter to the FDA s satisfaction, that the Company could not enroll new adult or pediatric patients in any protocol under such IND. The FDA also placed protocol BT-52 on clinical hold due to what the FDA deemed to be an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury to human subjects. The FDA cited 21 C.F.R. 312.42(b)(2)(i) and 21 C.F.R. 312.42(B)(1)(i), as grounds for imposition of a clinical hold. The FDA advised the Company that until it resolved the matter to the FDA s satisfaction, the Company could not legally conduct the identified clinical study under such IND. In a teleconference with the FDA on September 16, 2013 and pursuant to the Company s notification letter dated September 17, 2013, the Company notified the FDA that the proposed Phase III protocol BT-54 had been withdrawn from further consideration. After several amendments to the IND which were reviewed by the FDA, the FDA concluded that BT-52 can be initiated and the partial clinical hold was removed by the FDA on June 20, 2014. Additionally, the Company received IRB approval on February 4, 2015 for FDA reviewed protocol BT-55 open label, Phase II study of Antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 in patients with a Diffuse Intrinsic Brainstem Glioma (DIPG) in five treatment groups based on patients age and prior treatment. On April 20, 2016, the Company received a full clinical hold letter from the FDA based on FDA s inspection of S.R. Burzynski s manufacturing facility in March 2015. On April 27, 2016, the Company requested to change the full clinical hold to partial clinical hold to allow patient #1 to continue the Antineoplaston treatment according to protocol BT-55, since the patient was enrolled before the full clinical hold was imposed. Based on the FDA s position regarding the Company s request on April 27, 2016 and the Company s teleconference with the FDA on May 3, 2016, the Company removed patient #1 from the study. A temporary restraining order from the US District Court of Rhode Island allowed the resumption of patient #1 s Antineoplaston therapy on May 17, 2016. As a result of such temporary restraining order, a subsequent letter from the FDA dated May 26, 2016 informed the Company that the full clinical hold was replaced and a partial clinical hold was imposed. As a result, patient #1 restarted treatment under IND 43742. On June 14, 2016, the FDA issued a letter to the Company in connection with the FDA s inspection of S.R. Burzynski s manufacturing facility (the SRB Manufacturing in March 2015. The SRB Manufacturing addressed the issues raised in the letter in a response letter submitted to the FDA on July 5, 2016 and in subsequent letters. On February 20, 2017, BRI informed the FDA of the death of patient #1 on February 19, 2017. No new patients can be enrolled to protocol BT-55 or BT-52 until the partial hold on IND 43742 is lifted. On August 24, 2017, the FDA imposed a full clinical hold on IND 43742 until deficiencies regarding the SRB Manufacturing are resolved.

 Termination of the Original License Agreement Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement dated June 29, 1983, as superseded by an Amended License Agreement dated April 24, 1989 and a Second Amended License Agreement dated March 1, 1990 between the Company and Dr. Burzynski (collectively, the Original License Agreement ), the Original License Agreement terminated on July 2, 2019 upon the expiration of the last patent licensed to the Company from Dr. Burzynski. As of July 2, 2019, all patents previously licensed by the Company under the Original License Agreement have expired. New License Agreement On May 22, 2023, the Company entered into a new License Agreement (the New License Agreement with Dr. Burzynski, pursuant to which Dr. Burzynski licensed to the Company the exclusive rights in the Territory (composed of the United States and Canada) to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and distribute or otherwise exploit the licensed products and services relating to Antineoplastons, including but not limited to any patent rights which may be granted in these countries. The New License Agreement currently covers four United States patents owned by Dr. Burzynski. The Company will not be able to exploit such rights under the New License Agreement until such time as Antineoplastons are approved, of which there can be no assurance, by the FDA for sale in the United States. Results of Operations Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended August 31, 2023 Research and development costs were approximately 277,000 and 214,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 63,000 or 29 was due to an increase in personnel costs of 42,000 and facility and equipment costs of 22,000, offset by a decrease of 1,000 of other research and development costs, as a result of additional requests imposed by the Food and Drug Administration. General and administrative expenses were approximately 93,000 and 38,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 55,000 or 144 was due to an increase in other costs of 58,000, pertaining to patents, offset by a decrease in legal and other professional costs of 3,000, as a result of increased reporting requirements from regulatory agencies. The Company had net losses of approximately 370,000 and 252,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the net loss from 2024 to 2023 is primarily due to an overall increase in research and development costs and in general and administrative expenses of the Company as described above. Six Months Ended August 31, 2024 Compared to Six Months Ended August 31, 2023 Research and development costs were approximately 503,000 and 396,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 107,000 or 27 was due to an increase in facility and equipment costs of 44,000 and personnel costs of 63,000, as a result of additional requests imposed by the Food and Drug Administration. General and administrative expenses were approximately 238,000 and 143,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 95,000 or 66 was due to an increase in legal and other professional costs of 14,000, primarily relating to various discussions with our outside law firm and consultants regarding the Company s current clinical hold on IND 43742 and other future developments relating to Antineoplaston patents, and other costs of 81,000 as a result of reduced reporting requirements from regulatory agencies. The Company had net losses of approximately 741,000 and 540,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the net loss from 2023 to 2024 is primarily due to an overall increase in research and development costs and an increase in general and administrative expenses of the Company as described above.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s operations have been funded entirely by contributions from Dr. Burzynski and from funds generated from Dr. Burzynski s medical practice. Effective March 1, 1997, the Company entered into a Research Funding Agreement with Dr. Burzynski (the Research Funding Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to undertake all scientific research in connection with the development of new or improved Antineoplastons for the treatment of cancer and Dr. Burzynski agreed to fund the Company s Antineoplaston research for that purpose. Under the Research Funding Agreement, the Company hires such personnel as is required to conduct Antineoplaston research, and Dr. Burzynski funds the Company s research expenses, including expenses to conduct the clinical trials. Dr. Burzynski also provides the Company laboratory and research space as needed to conduct the Company s research activities. The Research Funding Agreement also provides that Dr. Burzynski may fulfill his funding obligations in part by providing the Company such administrative support as is necessary for the Company to manage its business. Dr. Burzynski pays the full amount of the Company s monthly and annual budget of expenses for the operation of the Company, together with other unanticipated but necessary expenses which the Company incurs. The amounts which Dr. Burzynski is obligated to pay under the agreement shall be reduced dollar for dollar by the following: (1) any income which the Company receives for services provided to other companies for research and/or development of other products, less such identifiable marginal or additional expenses necessary to produce such income, or (2) the net proceeds of any stock offering or private placement which the Company receives during the term of the agreement up to a maximum of 1,000,000 in a given Company fiscal year. The Research Funding Agreement, as amended, contains an annual automatic renewal provision providing for an additional one-year term, unless one party notifies the other party at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the then current term of the agreement of its intention not to renew the agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the term of the Research Funding Agreement was renewed and extended until February 28, 2025. It is expected that the Research Funding Agreement will continue to renew each year prospectively unless terminated under the provisions of the agreement. On May 22, 2023, the parties amended and restated the Research Funding Agreement in connection with the execution of the New License Agreement and to limit the scope of the Research Funding Agreement to the United States and Canada. The Research Funding Agreement automatically terminates in the event that Dr. Burzynski owns less than fifty percent of the outstanding shares of the Company, or is removed as President and/or Chairman of the Board of the Company, unless Dr. Burzynski notifies the Company in writing of his intention to continue the agreement notwithstanding this automatic termination provision. The Company estimates that it will spend approximately 600,000 during the remaining two quarters of the fiscal year ending February 28, 2025. While the Company anticipates that Dr. Burzynski will continue to fund the Company s research and FDA- related costs, there is no assurance that Dr. Burzynski will be able to continue to fund the Company s operations pursuant to the Research Funding Agreement or otherwise. In addition, Dr. Burzynski s medical practice has successfully funded the Company s research activities over the last 25 years and, in 1997, his medical practice was expanded to include traditional cancer treatment options such as chemotherapy, gene-targeted therapy, immunotherapy and hormonal therapy. Because the Company currently is entirely dependent upon the contributions for research provided by Dr. Burzynski under the Research Funding Agreement, the Company would not be able to continue conducting its clinical trials if Dr. Burzynski ceased funding the Company s research. In such event, the Company would be required to find immediate funding which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If this were to occur and the Company were not able to find adequate sources of funding, the Company would be required to cease operations. Even with Dr. Burzynski s continued contributions under the Research Funding Agreement, the Company may be required to seek additional capital through equity or debt financing or the sale of assets until the Company s operating revenues are sufficient to cover operating costs and provide positive cash flow; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise such additional capital on acceptable terms to the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will ever achieve positive operating cash flow.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Within the 90 days prior to the date of this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive and financial officers, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive and financial officers concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. There were no significant changes in the Company s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls subsequent to that date. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company s activities are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, including the FDA, which regularly monitor the Company s operations and often impose requirements on the conduct of its clinical trials and other aspects of the Company s business operations. The Company s policy is to comply with all such regulatory requirements. From time to time, the Company is also subject to potential claims by patients and other potential claimants commonly arising out of the operation of a medical practice. The Company seeks to minimize its exposure to claims of this type wherever possible. Currently, the Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings. Moreover, the Company is not aware of any such legal proceedings that are contemplated by governmental authorities with respect to the Company or any of its properties. Item 5. Other Informatio n .
