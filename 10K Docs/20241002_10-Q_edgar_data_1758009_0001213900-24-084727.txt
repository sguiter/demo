Notes
to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

June
30, 2024 

, under its prior name,
Ticketcart, Inc. The Company redomiciled to Delaware on February 22, 2018 and changed its name to Quantum Computing Inc. Effective July
20, 2018, the trading symbol for the Company s common stock, par value , on the OTC Market changed from IBGH 
to QUBT . On July 15, 2021 the Company uplisted to The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. On June 16, 2022, the Company merged with
QPhoton, Inc. QPhoton ), a developer of quantum photonic systems and related technologies and applications. 

Nature
of Business 

QCi
is an American company utilizing integrated photonics and non-linear quantum optics to deliver quantum and ancillary products for high-performance
computing applications based on patented and proprietary photonics technology. QCi s products are designed to operate at room temperature
and at very low power levels beyond the capabilities of other systems in the market. Our core photonics technology enables the execution
of a go-to-market strategy which emphasizes accessibility and affordability. Our quantum machines enable subject matter experts (SMEs)
and end users to deliver critical business solutions today in working with highly complex optimization problems. 

The
Company initially focused on providing software tools and applications for several commercially available quantum computers. However,
following the June 2022 merger with QPhoton and its associated intellectual property and engineering team, the Company now offers integrated
high-performance quantum systems, ancillary products and services. 

The
core of our quantum offerings today is our Entropy Quantum Computing EQC technology. We have built room-temperature,
photonic quantum information processing systems underpinned by a series of patented and patent pending technologies. Our technology,
supported by professional services through our Quantum Solutions offering, enables our clients to solve complex optimization
problems. In addition, our engineering teams are using our leading-edge photonics technology to continue to enhance and further develop
quantum LIDAR sensing and imaging systems, quantum-secured network solutions, and photonic chips. 

Going
Concern 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of operations, the realization of assets, and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. Cash and cash equivalents on hand were million as of June 30, 2024. The Company
has historically incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of June 30, 2024, the Company also had an accumulated deficit
of million and working capital of thousand. Furthermore, we have not achieved a level of sales adequate to support the
Company s cost structure and may need to raise additional funds in the next twelve months by selling additional equity or incurring
debt. It is management s opinion that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Net loss available to common stockholders basic and diluted 

Denominator: 

Weighted average shares used in computing net loss per common share basic and diluted 

Net loss per common share basic and diluted

Net
loss per share is based on the weighted average number of the Company s common shares and common share equivalents outstanding
during the period. 

In
periods with a reported net loss, the effect of anti-dilutive stock options, unvested restricted common stock and warrants are excluded
and diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share. Due to a net loss in the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,
there were therefore no dilutive securities and hence basic and diluted loss per share were the same. 

Options 

Unvested restricted common stock 

Total potentially dilutive shares 

As
all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net
loss per share for each period.

to pretax loss from continuing operations as a
result of both temporary and permanent differences in the U.S. GAAP vs tax treatment of certain types of expenses, including stock-based
compensation, depreciation and amortization, research and development and meals and entertainment. Additionally, the Company's policy
is to account for interest and penalties as income tax expense. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no interest
related to unrecognized tax benefits, and no amounts for penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in the provision
for income taxes. We do not anticipate any significant change within twelve months of this reporting date. 

As
of June 30, 2024, in addition to the million in tax-effected NOL carryforwards, at an assumed tax rate of , the significant
components of the Company s net deferred tax assets included stock-based compensation of million, capitalized research and
development expenditures of approximately million and an intangible asset basis difference of approximately thousand. The Company
believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, it has
provided a full valuation allowance on any potential deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by approximately million
for the period ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The provision for income taxes is not material in
the years presented due to there being no taxable income. 

The
Company has federal R D credit carryforwards of approximately for the period ended June 30, 2024, which will be applied
against payroll taxes, not against income taxes. The Company has no state R D credit carryforwards. 

The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions, with varying statutes of limitations.
The tax years from inception through 2024 remain open to examination due to the carryover of unused net operating losses that are being
carried forward for tax purposes.

Beginning on the date that is six months after

of the AI firm. On June 6, 2023, the Company
entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the MW Agreement with millionways, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase
from millionways up to three unsecured promissory notes (each, a MW Note ), in an aggregate principal amount of up to 
million, subject to the terms and conditions of the MW Agreement. Also on June 6, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the MW Agreement, the
Company purchased the MW Notes from millionways and loaned an aggregate principal amount of thousand to millionways. 

The
MW Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by millionways and the Company, as well as a most favored nations 
provision for the benefit of the Company. The MW Notes issued under the MW Agreement, including the MW Notes issued on June 6, 2023,
provide that the indebtedness evidenced by the applicable MW Note bears simple interest at the rate of per annum (or per annum
during the occurrence of an event of default, as defined in the MW Notes), and becomes due and payable in full on the earlier of (i)
May 16, 2024, (ii) a change of control (as defined in the MW Notes) of millionways, (iii) dollar-for-dollar prepayment for additional
capital received through any vehicle from a third party or (iv) an event of default. 

The Company reserved thousand of the outstanding

On
August 16, 2022, BV Advisory filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the DE Chancery Court naming the Company and certain of its directors and officers (among others) as defendants seeking, among other relief, monetary damages.
The Company believes that BV Advisory s claims have no merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. BV Advisory s claims
are not covered by the Company s liability insurance, nor does the Company believe it is necessary to accrue an amount in addition
to the BV Advisory Payable at this time. 

BV
Advisory v. QCi Appraisal Action 

BV
Advisory Partners, LLC BV Advisory was purportedly a shareholder of QPhoton, Inc., the predecessor in interest to QPhoton,
LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (both referred to as QPhoton in this Legal Proceedings discussion). BV Advisory,
rejected the Merger Consideration and on October 13, 2022, commenced litigation by filing a petition in the DE Chancery Court seeking
appraisal rights on the shares of QPhoton it allegedly owned (which shares represented of the shares of QPhoton outstanding immediately
prior to the Company s acquisition of QPhoton). The Company included BV Advisory s purported ownership of QPhoton in the
purchase price accounting for the QPhoton Merger. 

The
Company s total purchase price of QPhoton was approximately million, or million net of cash acquired, consisting of
Company common stock, Series B Preferred Stock and QPhoton Warrants. While the total shares of the Company s common stock on an
as-converted basis offered in the QPhoton Merger was (the Merger Consideration ), the fair market valuation contemplated
 of the shares, which assumed full conversion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to common stock at the 10:1
ratio, and that only of the warrants to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock (the QPhoton
Warrants would eventually be exercised (specifically only the QPhoton Warrants for which the associated Company options and/or
warrants had an exercise price at or below at the time of the Transaction). 

Accordingly,
as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has neither issued shares of the Company s common stock on an as converted
basis (the Unissued QPhoton Shares nor warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock (the Unissued
QPhoton Warrants that were included in the Merger Consideration. The Unissued QPhoton Shares are included in the statement of
stockholder s equity as additional paid in capital as of as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the Unissued QPhoton Warrants have no
carrying value as a liability on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2024.

shares of the Company s newly created Series A Convertible Preferred stock,
par value per share (the Series A Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase shares of the Company s
common stock (the Preferred Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of million. The Private Placement was completed
and closed to further investment on November 17, 2021. 

The
Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and liquidation rights. Each holder of
Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive, with respect to each share of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding and held by
such holder, dividends at the rate of ten percent per annum (the Preferred Dividends. The Company is obligated to
pay the Preferred Dividends quarterly, in arrears, within fifteen (15) days of the end of each quarter. The Company has the option to
pay the Preferred Dividends in cash or in common stock, at a price per share of common stock equal to the average of the closing sale
price of the common stock for the five (5) trading days preceding the applicable dividend payment date. The Preferred Dividends are accrued
monthly, but not compounded, and are recorded as interest expense, because the Preferred Dividends are mandatory and not declared at
the discretion of the Board of Directors. 

The
number of shares of the Company s common stock issuable upon conversion of any share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be determined

of the Company s common stock, at an exercise price of . Those warrants are exercisable for from the date of issuance. 

In
connection with the offering of Series A Preferred Stock in November 2021, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of
the Company s common stock at an exercise price of . Those warrants were exercisable for from the date of issuance
and have now expired. 

In
connection with the QPhoton Merger on June 16, 2022, the Company issued million warrants to purchase shares of the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of . Those warrants are exercisable when and if stock options and warrants issued by the Company
and outstanding as of June 15, 2022 (the Underlying Options are exercised. As of June 30, 2024, none of the QPhoton Warrants
linked to the outstanding Underlying Options are expected to be exercised as the exercise prices of the Underlying Options are above
the closing stock price as of June 30, 2024. The million issued warrants represent a portion of the million warrants included
in the Merger Consideration, having been received by two QPhoton shareholders. A third alleged shareholder rejected the Merger Consideration
and commenced litigation in DE Chancery Court (see Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings , for additional information), and to date
that litigation has not been resolved and the warrants have not been issued. 

Accordingly,
as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, we had only issued million of the QPhoton Warrants, of which approximately have been forfeited as
of June 30, 2024, because the corresponding Underlying Options had expired or forfeited. Further, as discussed in Note 2, Significant
Accounting Policies Fair Value of Financial Instruments , the QPhoton Warrants issued on June 16, 2022, are considered Level
3 liabilities for fair value measurement on the valuation hierarchy. Accordingly, the Company recognized mark-to-market gains of thousand
and thousand during the three and six months ended June 30,
2023, respectively, with an ending balance of thousand as of June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the QPhoton
Warrants have no carrying value as a liability on the Company s consolidated balance sheet and there was no mark-to-market adjustment
recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2024.

For
the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-based compensation on the statements of stockholders equity was lower by 
thousand and lower by thousand, respectively, as compared to the statements of cash flows for timing differences between award dates
and the realization of stock-based compensation expense. The net expense of million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 is primarily
attributable to vesting expense recognition, offset by insignificant pre-vesting forfeitures of common stock options for separated employees. 

In
terms of new issuances, the Company issued thousand shares of common stock to former executives in the six months ended June 30,
2024 per their respective employment and separation agreements (the Separation Agreement Shares ). . In conjunction with
the Separation Agreement Shares, the Company recognized thousand of stock-based compensation expense during the six months ended
June 30, 2024, and does not expect future expense related to these offerings as they are fully vested. During the six months ended
June 30, 2024, the Company issued thousand shares of common stock to thirty-five (35) employees as payment in lieu of cash for 2022
performance incentives (the 2022 Incentive Awards ). The 2022 Incentive Awards are restricted and primarily vest as follows:
one half vested on December 31, 2023 and one half will vest on December 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2024 the Company canceled of

effect to such restatement. 

Overview 

QCi is a development stage company. Our strategy
is to create a range of accessible and affordable quantum machines and photonics chips for use by commercial and government markets. We
have developed and continue to primarily develop quantum and photonics products for high-performance computing applications based on patented
and proprietary technology. Our technology is central to our strategy because we believe that it enables us to leverage the advantages
of size, weight, power and cost (over competing cryogenic products) to drive market adoption and volume of sales. Specifically, our products
are designed to operate at room temperature and at very low power levels at an affordable cost. 

1 

QCi s core technology is Entropy Quantum
Computing EQC ). EQC is a patent pending methodology that utilizes the environment to drive controlled energy loss in a
photonic architecture. The Company believes the EQC s small rack-mountable size and low-energy consumption provides a substantial
competitive edge as compared to superconducting, cryogenic quantum systems offered by competitors that are also designed to solve optimization
problems. In addition to our photonic computing platform, we have leveraged QCi s core technology to demonstrate powerful quantum
sensing use cases in LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), reservoir computing (a form of neural network that can be used in machine learning
applications) and quantum cyber authentication (a method for highly secure communication within a network). Several of these important
technologies are already in early stages of commercialization. 

Our longer-term product development plan is to
migrate product designs based on discrete components to a set of optical integrated circuits built on wafers using a crystalline material
called lithium niobate Thin Film Lithium Niobate or TFLN ). The Company believes that TFLN is an excellent
material for design and implementation of optical integrated circuits TFLN Chips suitable for our quantum computing and
sensing products because it is crystal based and hence can have optical waveguides directly etched into the material. QCi possesses strong
domain experience and intellectual property in TFLN design and chip fabrication and has completed initial production of several specialty
devices such as electro-optical modulators EOM s ). TFLN EOM s have the advantages of large bandwidth, low power
consumption, and small size. The Company has begun buildout of a state-of-the-art TFLN chip manufacturing facility in a leased space within
Arizona State University s Research Park in Tempe, Arizona. The Company s understanding is that this could be the nation s
first dedicated optical integrated circuit manufacturing foundry using TFLN wafers to achieve quantum effects and superior optical interconnects
for data centers. Our plan for the facility is to produce a range of custom lithium niobate chips for use in our own product lines as
well as chips for sale in the commercial market. The Company has plans to support this initiative by applying for funding for distinct
uses under both the Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program managed by the US Department of Energy s Loan Programs Office and also
the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act of 2022 (the CHIPS Act ), which specifically includes
 39 billion in manufacturing incentives and 13 billion to support new research and development. 

We believe that the practical benefits to the
customer of QCi s core offerings are: 

Powerful performance in speed and quality of solution for large complex optimization problems 

Plug and play compatibility with existing IT infrastructure 

Low power consumption normal operation under 80 watts 

Scalability with potential for migration to nanophotonic system-on-a-chip designs 

The Company has limited operations, has generated
limited revenue based on sales of products and related services to date, and is expanding our sales and marketing efforts to support our
current portfolio of commercially-available products and planned TFLN Chips. 

Market Opportunity 

Despite enormous growth in the capabilities of
conventional computers and silicon microprocessors, some of the world s most important computational problems are still considered
impractical to solve in a reasonable period of time. Quantum computing represents a potential alternative approach to solving those problems
because quantum computers apply the properties of quantum physics to operate in a fundamentally different way. Conventional computer chips
use binary bits (ones and zeros) to represent information. Quantum computers utilize qubits (quantum bits), which leverage some of the
properties of quantum physics, namely superposition and entanglement, to process computations that would be intractably difficult using
conventional computers. Quantum machines are intrinsically able to search very large solution spaces using these quantum effects and are
thereby able to perform optimization calculations in polynomial time vs. exponential time. 

While quantum-based computers will not replace
conventional computers in most applications, they are ideally suited to run optimization algorithms, as well as to calculate certain sensing,
imaging, and cybersecurity problems that are beyond the reach of general silicon-based computing today. The Company believes that quantum
solutions have the potential to bring order of magnitude advances in the fields of medicine, engineering, autonomous vehicles, and cybersecurity
and that the demand for quantum computing in these market sectors will likely outpace and outperform the general-purpose computing market
in the near- to mid-term and into the foreseeable future.

Our core technology offers practical, cost-effective
solutions that materially advance the adoption of quantum machines across several market segments including: 

1. 
 Quantum Computing 

2. 
 Quantum Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) 

3. 
 Remote Sensing 

4. 
 Imaging 

5. 
 Cybersecurity 

Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks 

The markets for high-performance conventional
and quantum computing and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new computing devices,
while also enhancing competing cloud-based services for businesses. Aggregate demand for our solutions, services, and devices is also
correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended
time in pace with this changing environment. 

The investments we are making in Quantum Optical
Chips and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Components for our devices are
primarily manufactured by third parties. Some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers.
Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. 

Our success is highly dependent on our ability
to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent. We compete for talented individuals by offering
an exceptional working environment, an ability to work on new, ground-breaking quantum technology, the ability to grow one s career
across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.

Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2024 were 183 thousand
compared to 112 thousand for the comparable prior year period, an increase of 71 thousand or 63 . Revenues for the six months ended
June 30, 2024 were 210 thousand compared to 233 thousand, a decrease of 23 thousand or 10 . The respective increase and decrease in
revenues are primarily due to changes in the number of, size of and level of effort performed on active customer proof-of-concept and
research and development contracts in the three months ended June 30, 2024. Revenue in the current reporting period is derived from professional
services provided to multiple government and commercial customers under multi-month contracts and hardware sales. 

Cost of Revenues 

Cost of revenues, which consists of direct labor
expenses, primarily salary expense for engineering and solutions staff delivering services, was 125 thousand for the three months ended
June 30, 2024 compared to 51 thousand for the comparable prior year period, an increase of 74 thousand or 145 . Cost of revenues for
the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 141 thousand compared to 107 thousand for the comparable prior year period, an increase of 34
thousand or 32 . The respective increases are primarily due to the increase in direct labor expense required to perform on the contracts
in the current quarter compared to the prior year period. 

Gross Margin 

Gross margin for the three months ended June 30,
2024 was 58 thousand and 32 , respectively, compared to 61 thousand and 55 , respectively, for the comparable prior year period, a decrease
of 3 thousand and 5 , respectively. Gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 69 thousand and 33 compared to 126 thousand
and 54 , a decrease of 57 thousand and 45 . The respective changes were nearly entirely the result of a reduction in contractual service
revenue where the cost of goods sold was defined under the terms of our general professional services obligation. Our lack of a scaled
and distributed base of revenue generation by product and sales channel can result in significant differences in gross margin between
reporting periods. 

Operating Expenses 

Information about our operating expenses for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 is set forth in the below tables (in thousands, except percentages). Operating expenses
for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by 1.7 million primarily as a result of lower general and administrative expenses
of 1.4 million and research and development expenses of approximately 400 thousand.

Research and development expenses consist primarily
of employee compensation for employees that primarily engage in research and development efforts and fees for the development of hardware
products and supporting software. We focus the bulk of our research and development activities on the continued development of existing
products and the development of new offerings for emerging market opportunities. 

Research and development expenses for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2024 decreased compared to the comparable prior year periods primarily due to employee-related
expenses. Decreases in bonus expenses were partially offset by net increases in stock-based compensation as the Company sought to
create long-term incentives to retain key technical employees. See Note 12, Stock-based Compensation , in the accompanying
notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. Additionally, net payroll costs and
professional services expenses decreased due to net reduced headcount as the Company reduced software development resources at the
end of 2023.

The 532 thousand increase in other income for
the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the comparable prior year period is the result of decreased interest expense for the
Streeterville Unsecured Note. The 455 thousand decrease in other expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the comparable
prior year period is the result of a 808 thousand decrease in interest expense for the Streeterville Unsecured Note, offset by a 370
thousand reduction of gains in the value of the warrant liability recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Interest expense, net consists of interest on financial liabilities
and amortization of debt issuance costs. The decrease in interest expense in 2024 compared to 2023 was attributable to decreased borrowings
outstanding under the Streeterville Unsecured Note which was paid-in-full as of March 1, 2024. See Note 8, Financial Liabilities ,
in the accompanying notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

The gain on change in value of warrant liability is primarily comprised
of mark-to-market adjustments for the QPhoton Warrants, which have had no carrying value as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Future
mark-to-market adjustments may result in losses if the Company s stock price increases above the exercise price of the Underlying
Options, as defined below. See Note 11, Capital Stock - Warrants , in the accompanying notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements for additional information on the QPhoton Warrants . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have incurred net losses and experienced negative
cash flows from operations since inception. Through June 30, 2024, the Company has raised 68.3 million through private and public placements
of equity and 12.6 million through private placements of convertible promissory notes and other debt for a total of 80.9 million. The
Company has no lines of credit or short-term debt obligations outstanding when excluding the remaining debt issuance costs. We expect
to incur additional losses and higher operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development
and go-to-market programs. We have determined that additional financing will be required to fund our operations for the next 12 months
and our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional capital and financing. As of June 30, 2024, the
Company had cash and cash equivalents of 2.5 million. 

Our primary uses of cash are to fund our operations as we continue
to grow our business. We will require a significant amount of cash for expenditures to fund business operations and continue to invest
in ongoing research and development for our non-linear quantum optical products and photonics chips. Until such time as we can generate
significant revenue from sales or subscriptions of our hardware offerings, we expect to finance our cash needs through public and/or private
equity and/or debt financings or other capital sources, including but not limited to U.S. government grant and loan programs. However,
we may be unable to raise sufficient funds or enter into such other arrangements, when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. In particular,
uncertain and unfavorable conditions in the United States and global macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures, rising
interest rates, banking collapses, and financial and credit market fluctuations, could reduce our ability to access capital on favorable
terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership
interest of our stockholders will be, or could be, diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences
that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements
that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital
expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may
be required to delay, limit, or substantially reduce our product development and go-to-market efforts. It is management s opinion
that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months
from the date of the issuance of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurances that
the Company will be able to secure additional equity investments or achieve an adequate sales level. 

The following table summarizes total consolidated
current assets, liabilities and working capital at June 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

At June 30, 2024, we had working capital of 522
thousand as compared to a working capital deficit of 2.2 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 2.7 million. The increase in working
capital is primarily attributable to an increase in cash proceeds from issuance of the common stock using the Company s ATM facility,
offset by the use of cash to pay for operating expenses and capital investments in property and equipment.

Cash Flows 

The following table summarizes our cash flow for
the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).

 1,889 

Net cash used in operating activities for the
six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7.9 million and 8.9 million, respectively, in each case primarily as a result of our net
loss in each period offset by noncash adjustments for stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization; the prior year comparable
period also included adjustments for a mark-to-market gain on the QPhoton Warrant liability. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the
six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.7 million and 1.1 million, respectively, and was attributable to our purchase of computer
hardware, laboratory and TFLN Chip manufacturing equipment. The increase in investment in the current period is primarily due to the purchase
of additional equipment in establishing the Company s TFLN Chip manufacturing facility in a leased space within Arizona State University s
Research Park in Tempe, Arizona. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
 11.0 million and 11.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows provided by financing activities
during the six months ended June 30, 2024 were attributable to use of the ATM facility to sell shares of our common stock, offset by repayments
on the Streeterville Unsecured Note and redemptions of Series A Preferred shares. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the
period ended June 30, 2023 were attributable to the use of the ATM facility to sell shares of our common stock. 

On a long-term basis, our liquidity is dependent
on the continuation and expansion of operations and receipt of revenues. Demand for the products and services will be dependent on, among
other things, market acceptance of our products and services, the technology market in general, and general economic conditions, which
are cyclical in nature. As most of our revenues will be from the sales of our products and services, our business operations may be adversely
affected by the actions of our competitors and prolonged recession periods 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Certain of our accounting policies require the
application of significant judgment by our management, and such judgments are reflected in the amounts reported in our consolidated financial
statements. In applying these policies, our management uses judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination
of estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of market trends, information
provided by our strategic partners and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Actual results may differ significantly
from the estimates contained in our consolidated financial statements. 

Fair Value of Stock-based Compensation and
Derivatives 

We recognize stock-based compensation expense
for all share-based payment awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . Stock-based compensation
expense for expected-to-vest awards is valued under the single-option approach and amortized on a straight-line basis, accounting for
actual forfeitures as they occur. We utilize the Black-Scholes pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock-based option
awards. The Black-Scholes pricing model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option life, and
risk-free interest rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management s
best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If factors change and different
assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. 

Another area of critical accounting estimates
involves determining the fair market value of the QPhoton Warrants, as defined below. The Company determines which underlying options
and warrants are in-the-money or out-of-the-money at period end by comparing to the bid price of the Company s common stock, then
accounts for changes period-over-period by realizing a mark-to-market gain or loss for the period. 

7 

Fair Market Value and Useful Life of Intangible
Assets 

Determining the fair market value and useful life
of the intangible assets acquired by the Company through the merger with QPhoton is another critical accounting estimate. In the absence
of market pricing for the intangible assets, the Company relied on independent third-party appraisal experts and comparison with similar
transactions to arrive at estimates of value as well as useful life. The Company will perform periodic assessments of the intangible assets
for impairment, but if any of the initial estimates are incorrect, that could result in a calculation of amortization expense that is
too high or too low. 

Valuation Allowances for Deferred Taxes 

Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and
liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s assessment of estimated current and future income taxes
to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated
income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements,
which are expected to result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets
within the jurisdiction from which they arise, for all material jurisdictions, we consider all available positive and negative evidence,
including scheduled reversals of deferred tax balances, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent
operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future
state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future
taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating results. 

As of June 30, 2024,
we had federal and state net operating loss NOL carryforwards of approximately 57 million, or 14.9 million on a tax-effected
basis. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these NOL carryforwards will not be realized. Accordingly, we
have provided a full valuation allowance on any potential deferred tax assets relating to these NOL carryforwards. If our assumptions
change and we determine we will be able to realize these NOLs, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2024, will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense. 

The calculation of our
tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions
across our global operations. ASC 740, Income Taxes , states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized
when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals
or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. 

We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities
in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not
previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a tax payment that
is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as
increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is made available. 

We believe that none of the unrecognized tax benefits
may be recognized by the end of 2024. 

Legal and Other Contingencies 

The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are
subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge
to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable
outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, 
as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). In designing
and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and
procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation,
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Specifically, the Company
does not have sufficient accounting staff to enable proper segregation of duties. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

Except as listed below, there is no action, suit,
or proceeding by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the
executive officers of the Company or our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting the Company, our common stock, our subsidiaries,
or the Company s or its subsidiaries officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could
have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

BV Advisory v. QCi Appraisal Action 

BV Advisory Partners, LLC BV Advisory was purportedly
a shareholder of QPhoton, Inc., the predecessor in interest to QPhoton, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (both referred to
as QPhoton in this Legal Proceedings discussion). On October 13, 2022, BV Advisory filed a petition in the DE Chancery Court
seeking appraisal rights (the Appraisal Petition on the shares of common stock of QPhoton it allegedly owns (which shares
represented 10 of the shares of common stock of QPhoton outstanding immediately prior to the Company s acquisition of QPhoton)
pursuant to Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The parties agreed to suspend discovery pending resolution
of outstanding motions in two related cases. As of October 1, 2024, BV Advisory does not have counsel retained on the Appraisal Petition,
and the Company does not have sufficient information to assess the potential impact of the appraisal demand at this time. 

BV Advisory v. QCi Breach Lawsuit 

On March 1, 2021, QPhoton entered into a Note
Purchase Agreement with BV Advisory. Under the Note Purchase Agreement, on March 1, 2021, March 23, 2021 and July 9, 2021, QPhoton and
BV Advisory entered into convertible promissory notes for 200,592, 150,000, and 150,000, respectively, for a total of 500,592 (the
 BV Notes ). The BV Notes all bore interest at a rate of 6 per annum and matured two years from the grant date. On June 16,
2022, the effective date of our acquisition of QPhoton, QPhoton tendered a cashier s check to BV Advisory in the amount of 535,684.24,
representing the full principal balance of the BV Notes and accrued interest through June 16, 2022. On July 14, 2022, BV Advisory returned
the cashier s check and disputed the calculation of the amount paid to settle the BV Notes. 

On August 16, 2022, BV Advisory filed a complaint
in the DE Chancery Court naming the Company and certain of its directors and officers (among others) as defendants (the Breach
Lawsuit ). BV Advisory Partners, LLC v. Quantum Computing Inc. , et al., C.A. No. 2022-0719-VCG (Del. Ch.). BV Advisory is
seeking, among other relief, monetary damages for an alleged breach of the Note Purchase Agreement between BV Advisory and QPhoton, as
well as monetary damages for alleged breach of an alleged binding letter of intent among Barksdale Global Holdings, LLC BGH ),
Inference Ventures, LLC Inference Ventures and QPhoton. BV Advisory and its affiliates claim that pursuant to the letter
of intent they had the right to acquire additional shares in QPhoton by investing 2.5 million in QPhoton. BV Advisory claims QPhoton
refused to allow BV Advisory to purchase the equity. However, BV Advisory never made the additional investment in QPhoton. The Company
believes that BV Advisory s claims have no merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. The Company filed a motion to dismiss
most of the Breach Lawsuit, and on May 28, 2024 the DE Chancery Court dismissed eight of the ten counts in the BV Advisory complaint.
On July 24, 2024 the DE Chancery Court entered an Order dismissing those eight counts with prejudice. 

As of October 1, 2024, the parties are preparing for a conference with
the DE Chancery Court to be held in October to discuss a schedule for resolving other pending motions in the Breach Lawsuit, as well as
the Appraisal Petition, pending BV Advisory retaining counsel in the latter action. 

10 

QCi v. BV Advisory Defamation Lawsuit 

On December 30, 2022 the Company, QPhoton and
Robert Liscouski (the Quantum Plaintiffs filed suit in the Superior Court of New Jersey (the NJ Court against
Keith Barksdale, Michael Kotlarz, BV Advisory, BGH, Power Analytics Global Corporation PAG ), and Inference Ventures (and
together with Barksdale, Kotlarz, BV Advisory, BGH, and PAG the BV Defendants ), alleging fraud, aiding and abetting fraud,
defamation, and conspiracy to defraud, seeking monetary and injunctive relief (the Defamation Lawsuit ). The Company claims
that the BV Defendants have made numerous public statements defaming the Company and its management in furtherance of a plan to manipulate
the trading prices of the Company s common stock, and that the BV Defendants misrepresented their ownership in QPhoton and conspired
to acquire additional shares of QPhoton at the Company s expense. The BV Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on March
24, 2023, and on June 5, 2023, the NJ Court largely denied the BV Defendants motion. On January 31, 2024, the BV Defendants
filed a motion for reconsideration of their motion to dismiss. On March 7, 2024, the NJ Court issued an order, granting the BV Defendant s
motion dismissing the Company s case on procedural grounds because, according to the NJ Court, the Company can assert its claims
against Defendants in the Delaware courts. The Company filed a motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing the case, which was
argued on April 30, 2024. On May 1, 2024 the NJ Court affirmed its initial order dismissing the case and directed the Company to file
its claims against the BV Defendants in Delaware. The Company is currently evaluating whether it should file the claims in Delaware and
does not have sufficient information at this time to assess the potential impact of the action against the BV Defendants. 

BV Advisory Receivership Petition 

On July 27, 2023, BV Advisory and its managing
member, Keith Barksdale, as alleged stockholders of and claimants against the Company, filed a petition in the DE Chancery Court to appoint
a receiver for the Company based on allegations that the Company is insolvent due to purported poor corporate governance and cash management.
The petition also objects to the Company s approach to raising capital. In a related motion, the petitioners also sought expedited
treatment of the petition on July 28, 2023, alleging that they face a threat of irreparable harm. The Company strongly disagrees with
the allegations in the petition. On August 23, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the petition. The Company s motion to
dismiss and BV Advisory s motion for expedited treatment were argued before the DE Chancery Court on October 11, 2023. The DE Chancery
Court denied BV Advisory s motion to expedite and on May 28, 2024 the DE Chancery Court granted the Company s motion to dismiss
the petition without prejudice. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

We believe there are no changes that constitute
material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed
with the SEC on April 1, 2024. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds. 

There were no unregistered sales of the Company s
equity securities during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 

Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities. 

There has been no default in the payment of principal,
interest, sinking or purchase fund installment, or any other material default, with respect to any indebtedness of the Company. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 

Not Applicable.
